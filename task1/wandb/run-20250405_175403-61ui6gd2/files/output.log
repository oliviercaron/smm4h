The installed version of bitsandbytes was compiled without GPU support. 8-bit optimizers, 8-bit multiplication, and GPU quantization are unavailable.
CUDA is required but not available for bitsandbytes. Please consider installing the multi-platform enabled version of bitsandbytes, which is currently a work in progress. Please check currently supported platforms and installation instructions at https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation#multi-backend
