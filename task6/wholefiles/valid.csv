Following a strenuous walk, the side effects intensified, prompting a visit to the emergency room where tests were conducted, ruling out any life-threatening conditions. The medical staff attributed my symptoms to an allergic reaction to the vaccine, leaving me with lingering cognitive impairments and memory issues. Despite being outwardly functional, I continue to struggle internally and plan to consult my doctor for further evaluation. If anyone has encountered similar prolonged side effects from the Shingrix vaccine, I would appreciate hearing about your experiences and how long it took for the symptoms to subside. Your insights would be invaluable as I navigate through this challenging period. Thank you in advance for any guidance or support. ---",1
7641,"Asking if anyone else knows: I got both Moderna Vaccine doses in fear of losing work last year in February. 3 months after my skin started acting up. My chin turned into a giant zit and the doc said it wasn't shingles. He gave me steroids and it took 3 weeks to go down and it was incredibly painful and just lightly pressing on my chin would cause a jet of puss to shoot onto my bathroom mirror. I also had an allergic reaction (never been allergic to anything in my life) to balsamic glaze I put on some bread. Full blown anaphylaxis. I had to have the paramedics take me to the ER. Since then, my skin on my face will randomly become red and blotchy and my skin will peel like I got a sunburn. I've also had bouts of uncontrollable rage and outbursts of violence having never been this way before. My doctor told me he can't attribute anything to the vaccine because of blow back he will receive and I am left with no answers. I wish I never got this poison put in my body.",1
4654,"""Developed shingles after Moderna shot: Hey everyone, Just wanted to share my recent experience. Two weeks after receiving the Moderna vaccine, I started experiencing severe upper back pain and shooting pains in my lower left shoulder blade. At first, I attributed it to vaccine soreness, but the intensity of the pain made me doubt that. The pain extended to my underarm and torso, becoming extremely sensitive to touch. Additionally, I felt like my spine between the shoulder blades was bruised. After a week of discomfort, I visited the doctor who suspected inflammation due to swollen lymph nodes post-vaccination. However, a day after that appointment, I developed a cluster rash under my left breast, along with worsening pain and inflammation in my sternum. The shooting pains persisted, prompting me to seek medical help again, where I was diagnosed with shingles. The doctor explained that the Moderna vaccine may have weakened my immune system during antibody production, allowing the shingles virus to manifest. It's been rough, but I'm relieved to have a diagnosis and the appropriate treatment. I'm considering further investigation for any underlying autoimmune condition, as shingles post-vaccination is reportedly more common in individuals with autoimmune disorders. I've also reported my experience to the CDC through v-safe and the VAERS form. Has anyone else encountered similar symptoms? Any advice for managing the pain? Hoping for some relief soon. ??""",1
7426,"Post-immunization rash location: Asking here because I'll be on hold or waiting for a callback from a healthcare professional for hours most likely and I cannot seem to find a direct answer anywhere in the aftercare literature given to me or online. My 12-month old had his 12m vaccines last Wednesday. He had 3 shots: MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella & Varicella), Men-C (Meningococcal conjugate C), & Pneu C-13 (Pneumococcal). For the MMRV vaccine it says ""rash may appear up to 23 days after vaccination (...) These side effects may occur 8-10 days after immunization"". I noticed a rash on his lower back and upper bum cheeks. Does not look like diaper rash and the rash is not around his genitals or anus. It's a little bit raised as well. Anyone know if the *location* of the potential rash as a MMRV vaccine side effect matters? Basically trying to determine if this is in fact vaccine related or not. There are a lot of google hits that say ""redness or raised bump(s) around the injection site"". He has nothing around his injection sites. Thanks!",1
5845,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: It's because of the chicken pox vaccines given to kids. Shingles is the same virus. It lives dormant in your spinal fluid. It used to be that getting exposed to the chicken pox (after having had it) would keep your immunity up, and keep the virus from reactivating. People used to get shingles when they were much older, had a back injury, or a weakened immune system. Now, barely anyone has exposure to the virus in the wild. Natural immunity suffers, so when it is encountered, BOOM. This was what was explained to me by several doctors. Anecdotally, my son had the chicken pox vaccine when it first came out. Then he was exposed at daycare; he developed shingles on the arm he had the vaccine in. He also gave chicken pox to his father, who had never had it as a kid. I was unaffected, as I had the pox when I was a kid.",1

Now, I'm running a fever and my arm continues to ache. Hoping that the prescribed painkillers and antivirals will help alleviate the discomfort. To make matters worse, I had a minor surgery last week to address an ongoing issue. It seems like I can't catch a break. To anyone else going through a tough time, know that you're not alone in your struggles. Edit: What's even more surprising is that I've never had a negative reaction to any vaccines before. This unexpected side effect is a result of the flu shot, and it's quite unusual given my medical history. Just goes to show that you never know how your body will react to certain treatments.",1

As a 23-year-old female with UC and CRPS, I decided to follow my doctor's advice and get vaccinated to safeguard against shingles. However, post-vaccination, I faced severe nerve pain, numbness in my arm and hand, stomach discomfort, muscle and joint pain, chills, and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted for days, landing me in the ER seeking relief. The ER doctor attributed my reactions to being immunocompromised and possibly an adverse interaction with my current medication. Despite the uncertainty, I underwent ketamine injections to alleviate the CRPS flare, which thankfully helped manage the nerve pain. Now, as I recover, I'm contemplating the decision to proceed with the second shingrix vaccine if recommended by my healthcare team.

It didn't hurt, didn't itch, nothing. But it annoyed him that it was there for a couple weeks. He got a telehealth appointment, and the doctor looked at it over Zoom, then had him go right in so the doctor would verify what he thought it was since he wasn't expecting to see shingles in a young person. Well, it was shingles. My husband never had a single pox mark as a kid. He was asymptomatic to the point that he thought he never had chicken pox. There was nothing the doctor could do since there was no pan or anything, but did tell him to stay away from people who hadn't had chickenpox or the vaccine. Oops. Our daughter has a legit medical exemption to most vaccines due to the severity of her reactions to the few she's had (I also react so horribly that I have no intention of ever getting another vaccine-hospitalized twice from vaccine reactions). Poor dear spend her 12th birthday with chickenpox, which sucked. She had measles a few years prior.

3239,"Struggling with my 3rd bout of the Tetanus infection: Hey everyone, I'm a 40-year-old individual currently grappling with my 3rd bout of the Tetanus infection. My first encounter with Tetanus was back in 2010 after a gardening accident, and the excruciating muscle spasms and stiffness left me incapacitated for weeks. It was a harrowing experience that I never thought I would have to revisit. After receiving my recent Tetanus vaccine, I hoped to put that chapter behind me. However, the telltale signs of Tetanus started creeping back into my life - jaw stiffness, muscle rigidity, and difficulty swallowing. The fear of lockjaw setting in again is a constant source of anxiety for me, especially knowing how debilitating it can be. Managing the pain and discomfort that comes with Tetanus has been a struggle, compounded by the stress of everyday life. Juggling work responsibilities, family commitments, and now this recurring infection has left me feeling overwhelmed and drained. I find myself constantly worrying about when the symptoms will worsen and how it will impact my daily routine. I'm currently undergoing treatment to alleviate the symptoms and prevent any complications, but the uncertainty of future flare-ups looms large. I'm curious if there are others out there who have faced multiple bouts of Tetanus and how they navigate through the challenges it presents. If you have any advice, insights, or simply want to share your own journey with Tetanus, I would greatly appreciate any support. Let's lean on each other for strength and encouragement as we confront the hurdles of battling recurrent infections. Thank you for listening to my story, and let's stay resilient in the face of adversity.",1

Question: Has anyone encountered neurological symptoms post Covid vaccine similar to what I'm experiencing? How did you manage it and did it affect your decision to get the second dose? Backstory: After receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on April 5, I started noticing unusual neurological symptoms such as severe headaches, dizziness, and tingling sensations in my fingers and toes. These symptoms persisted for several days and I consulted with a neurologist who recommended further evaluation. The doctors suspect it could be a rare neurological reaction to the vaccine. I'm now hesitant about proceeding with the second dose considering the impact on my health. I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has gone through a similar situation and how they navigated their decision regarding the second dose. I believe in the importance of vaccination but I want to prioritize my health and well-being. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. **UPDATE**: Despite the neurological symptoms following the first dose, I decided to go ahead with the second dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine on April 26th. Surprisingly, I did not experience any worsening of the neurological symptoms and they gradually subsided over time. It has been two weeks since the second dose and I have not encountered any new neurological issues. I'm relieved that I was able to complete the vaccination and I hope my experience can provide reassurance to others facing similar concerns.",1
1491,"Moderna: A Journey of Healing and Hope: Hello fellow Redditors! I wanted to share my personal experience with the Moderna vaccine and how it has impacted my life. After receiving my first dose of Moderna, I experienced no immediate side effects and was grateful for a smooth vaccination process. However, as the days passed, I started noticing subtle changes in my energy levels and overall well-being. I felt a renewed sense of vitality and motivation that had been missing for a while. The chronic pain in my joints also seemed to lessen, allowing me to move more freely and engage in activities that I had previously avoided. Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, I hit a rough patch after the second dose of Moderna. I developed a low-grade fever and body aches that made me feel under the weather for a few days. It was a challenging time, but I reminded myself that these were signs of my body building immunity against the virus. After the initial discomfort subsided, I noticed a significant improvement in my overall health. The joint pain that had plagued me for years became more manageable, and my energy levels soared to new heights. I found myself enjoying activities that I had long forgotten, thanks to the protection offered by the Moderna vaccine. Despite a few setbacks along the way, I am grateful for the positive impact that Moderna has had on my life. I feel more confident in facing the uncertainties of the pandemic and am hopeful for a brighter, healthier future ahead. If you're considering getting vaccinated, I encourage you to listen to your body and take that important step towards safeguarding your health. Feel free to ask me any questions about my experience with Moderna, and remember that we're all in this together. Stay safe and stay protected!",1
5718,"Shingles and/or PHN after the COVID-19 Vaccine: It is interesting to see so many people having Shingles outbreaks after getting the covid vaccines and or boosters. Some are experiencing a shingles flare-up for the first time, some are experiencing a flare-up of previously long-term dormant shingles, while others are experiencing Post Herpatic Neuralgia (PHN), and of course a combination. Sadly, it is causing pain, anxiety and depression for many who didn't expect this as an outcome of getting the covid vaccine....and thereby causing concern and hesitancy about getting the 2nd or 3rd (booster) shot. This is where I am. I planned on getting the booster, but I have been experiencing PHN for 8 months since my first covid shot. So, I'm reluctant to get it and trying to learn what I can in order to decide what is best. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to get covid, but I also don't want to continue experiencing phn pain or another shingles flare-up. If I understand this correctly.... I learned that the flare-up of shingles/phn is not a direct side effect of the covid vaccines, but instead seems to be a situation where the body's immune system is busy creating antibodies and while working to do what the vaccine was intended to do the immune system is weakened and stressed just enough to allow the shingles to awaken in the spinal column. Since this question comes up a lot in this sub, I wanted to initiate a resource thread with articles and videos that may shed some light or answer questions we have concerning shingles and PHN as they relate following covid vaccinations and boosters. The purpose is only to share info that may be helpful, NOT to persuade anyone as to what they should do. Everyone's covid vaccine/shingles/PHN experience is different as there are many variables among us. In terms of pain/discomfort easing, I've benefitted from St. John's Wort oil applied topically and occasional use of Ibuprofen. I hope you find relief from yucky ailment.

1385,"To shingle or not to shingle: or: A confusing story until now. A week ago I got my second vaccine shot (Comirmaty, Biontech), the day after I had some weird sensations. Thinking an insect crawled over me somewhere on my back, feeling a bit itchy, but not getting a relief by scratching it. It did not feel good touching it. Day 2 I couldn't feel the warmth of the shower water in that spot, it felt cold, yet on the rest of my body it certainly was warm. A look in the mirror showed a red spot, the size of a bigger coin. It was hurting with burning pain to the inside, so I went to see a doctor about it who suspected either an allergic reaction or shingles about to unfold. He wasn't sure enough to start treatment. Day 3 went to a doctor again cause my overall status got way worse. I never felt that exhausted in my life before. Everything takes ages, I have to gather all energy I have to fulfill single actions. That doctor confirmed the guess of the first, yet also wasn't sure enough to start treatment. Both wanted me to wait until blisters show up. At least I already got the medication (Aciclovir) so I could start the moment the typical rash would show, as well as pain meds (Metamizol). Those helped me big time. Day 4-6 I mostly spend sleeping with medium burning pain, mostly in the morning when the pain meds wore off. Itchiness on my neck, shoulder, sometimes behind the left ear. Lymph nodes swallen under the armpits, neck front, above collar bone, sides of the groin. Day 7 (today) I woke up with a sore throat having difficulties swallowing, a little infection near a tooth and overall feeling ill. This was one of the risk factors of the pain meds, so I went to the doctors again. Deep in my throat an infection is starting. Not sure to say what causes it. I shall stop taking Metamizol and change to Ibuprofen, which is not as strong, still helps a bit. My pain is primarily on the left side of the rib cage, front + back + side. Burning on the back. More swallen lymph nodes in the groin. Surely a little feaver. Seems like my body is fighting against something bigtime. Btw the only visible red spot that got me to the doctors at the start has kinda healed",1

434,"It just dawned on me that it's been over 1.5 years since all this began...not just 6 months. What a revelation. Until now, I had only considered myself a long hauler post-COVID, which hit me in November '22. I had convinced myself that I was only 6 months into this long COVID journey. The reality (for me) is that with each vaccine dose, my health deteriorated a bit. Severe post-exertional malaise, flare-ups of my rare vascular autoimmune disease - it all seemed to worsen. However, I brushed it off, attributing it to my pre-existing autoimmune condition, Behcet's, which shares symptoms with long COVID due to its vascular inflammatory nature. Then came my second booster (4th shot) in February '22, and it completely wrecked me. It triggered the worst disease flare I've experienced in 8 years. I had a high fever of 103 degrees for days, and the pain was so unbearable that I couldn't even sit for weeks. Despite all this, I continued to believe it was just another autoimmune flare that would come and go. But new symptoms emerged over the next few months: - Severe migraine flare-ups after years of having them under control. - Shingles outbreak. - PEM and CFS-like pain with any form of exercise. - Aggravated endometriosis that led me to the ER and eventually surgery. The inflammation eventually subsided, but I never connected any of these issues to vaccine injury or long COVID. Then, in November '22, I contracted COVID at home, which reignited my battle with long COVID. It's only now hitting me that I've been a long-term long hauler all along. 1.5 years? 2 years? No wonder the healing process is taking its time. Acceptance is a tough pill to swallow, but it's a necessary step in moving forward.",1

How do I stop a negative immune response to viruses and vaccines before it causes serious damage?: I am relatively young 41M, I believe I may have RA which means my immune system is disordered, I had chickenpox as a child, and I am suffering greatly after receiving my covid vaccine last week. I had an immediate reaction leading to numbing paresthesia on multiple parts of my body including face, legs, and hands. About 4 days later the numbness became pain and redness in my knees and legs. I was prescribed by my PCP **5 days of 50mg prednisone to stop my inflammation** and to alleviate facial numbness. It worked alleviating most paresthesia, but I'm also aware that prednisone and RA can increase your risk of shingles.

7291,"68M reaction to the 2nd dose of the flu vaccine: My dad (68M) is experiencing a reaction to the 2nd dose of the flu vaccine. It has been almost 72 hours since he got the shot on Thursday afternoon. On Friday, he started feeling unwell - headache, slight fever (""around 100 degrees,"" according to him). By Saturday morning, he woke up with a severe full-body rash. My mom thinks it resembles chicken pox, while my dad says it looks similar to the target rashes he had when he had Lyme disease as a child, but covering his entire body. He described the rash as ""kind of topographical."" It was very itchy, prompting him to take Benadryl twice, which helped with the itching but did not improve the appearance of the rash. Today (Sunday), I finally had the chance to visit them and see the rash for myself. It is still present, raised in some areas, and consists of a lot of semi-circles that resemble cupping marks. The rash is red and extremely itchy. I provided him with CVS brand anti-itch cream, which alleviated the itching but did not change the rash's appearance. Although my dad has never had chicken pox and is unsure if he was ever exposed, I know it's common for individuals in his age group to have been. He never received the chicken pox vaccine, mostly due to negligence. He has not experienced any significant reactions to other vaccines or even the first dose of this one. In terms of other health conditions, he is obese but relatively active, maintains a decent diet, had a history of AFib (resolved with an ablation), and managed asthma with Advair 500. He is reluctant to see a doctor, and my mom is currently dealing with her own health issues. I'm considering pushing him to seek medical advice, but I'm unsure if these symptoms are common side effects or if there could be a different underlying cause. Could this possibly be chicken pox? That's my main concern.",1

Question: Has anyone had (or heard of) recurrences/outbreaks of a common carried & suppressed virus (such as a cold sore, shingles, mononucleosis/EBV) after receiving the Covid vaccine? What have you seen? Would you recommend someone like me getting the second dose? Backstory: Received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Jan 12. I had the usual sore arm starting on the day of injection but the next day I developed a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The next day I was hit with a wave of nausea so debilitating I couldn't get out of bed for a full 24 hours, although it went away as quickly as it came. Fatigue set in and I spent the next two weeks sleeping 15-20 hrs a day. (I was written out of work for having ""Covid like symptoms"" so nothing else to do but rest up.) After a week of these various symptoms, I made a doctor's appt and he ran a wide range of blood tests (all normal) to test for infection, immune response, etc. He stated that it could be a reactivation of the Epstein-Barr Virus: EBV or Mono(nucleosis). I do have EBV antibodies (or I did in 2011 when last tested). I haven't had mono since I was in high school (confirmed via bloodwork at the time) and a suspected reactivation about a year afterward. A week after receiving the vaccine, I had a rapid and (relatively) large outbreak of either a cold sore or shingles (it is on my chin & neck - has been previously diagnosed as both Varicella & HSVI on different occasions...). I typically have outbreaks of this on my lip line when getting dental work, lots of sun exposure, or am very stressed. This is the third time it has been on my chin/neck - the two other times were when I was hospitalized. I'm curious if anyone else has had these recurrences of viral syndromes that have been previously suppressed as well? If so, did you get the second dose? How were your symptoms afterward? I am in full support of the vaccine effort, just wanting to prepare myself for another 2-3 weeks of being out of work if",1

I broke out in to a rash that progressively got worse on my legs and arms. It was so bad I couldn't sleep so I went to patient first and was given prednisone and my body didn't like that. My heart rate got really low and I started passing out so I went to the ER. I've seen so many specialist it's not even funny. No one can tell me what happened or why. They said it's basically eczema but I also think I now have shingles. I also had some possible unrated inflammation they found during testing. They said they won't know a lot until 8-10 years since it's a *newish* vaccine. And they can't recommend I get it. i have a lot of worries about getting covid, especially with my my weird reactions to medications. the Er couldn't explain why the steroid dropped my heart rate and i worry if i get covid i cant do proper treatment. i did a lot of research and i feel like i am ok with the risk of trying to get boosted again so i made an appt. i went to CVS and i was honest, they refused to give me the booster which i totally understand. He said he was worried that my reaction would get worse with each vaccine and he said he didn't think i should do it. He said that maybe i could try Moderna but there is know why to know i wont have an issues with that one either. im just really scared because no one can give me any answers and i dont know what to do.

7161,"My experiences so far with the Johnson & Johnson trail vaccine: I sincerely hope vaccines for COVID19 are approved and used by as many people as possible to stop this pandemic and get things back to normal as much as possible. To help with the effort, I tried to volunteer for different Phase 3 trials. To make it to phase 3, the vaccines need to show they are producing antibodies and not have serious side effects for people. After 3 attempts, I was selected to participate in the Johnson & Johnson ENSEMBLE trial vaccine. After getting final approval after the screening process, including a medical history and some blood tests, I got the shot. Everybody's reactions to the vaccines are different, so I would like to share some of my experiences. I get the flu vaccine every year and have almost no reaction. Earlier this year I had the Shingrix shingles vaccine and it hurt at the injection with moderate pain for a short time then mild pain for a couple of days. I had mild discomfort when I lied on my shoulder the first night, then things got better. The toughest vaccine for me is the tetanus shot. That shot makes me feel like I got punched in the shoulder and hurts for 2 or 3 days. I'd say my pain last time was 5 or 6 out of 10. Hopefully that will provide a reference for my experience with the COVID vaccine. When I received the COVID shot, immediately I felt mild pain in my shoulder. It radiated out a little further than the Tetnus shot did, including my jaw and chest and peaked at a moderate level for a few minutes at about a 5 out of 10 scale. Not pleasant, but not too bad. Also, I started to feel like I was getting a mild cold, but never developed a temperature. I'm now at day 2 still feel some mild symptoms like I'm getting a cold. I occasionally feel mild pain around the injection site, jaw and behind the shoulder blade. Per the information, these are the common, expected side effects. They let you take Advil or other pain relievers to help with the symptoms. I'm hopeful that this is a sign my body is still working hard to develop anti-bodies. I had a 50/50% chance to get the vaccine or a saline solution placebo. Based on my reactions after the shot, I probably got the real vaccine. There are two positive things about the J&J vaccine that I hope can help a lot of people. First, it works with only",1
7279,"Got the Shingles vaccine for Rinvoq-Heres what happened : Sadly I have failed Remicade (along with two other meds) and it's time to try Rinvoq but my doctor won't prescribe it until I'm vaccinated for Shingles. I was a little scared of the side effects after reading various testimonials of other people's experiences and thought I'd share mine. Since we are compromised, if you can, I strongly recommend you take off of work the entire day of the vaccine plus at least the following day. I got the Shingrix shot at 12:30pm. It was slightly painful, but I'm so used to needles at this point that I didn't care. Pain at the injection site was pretty much just an intense soreness that started within the first hour of getting the shot and progressively got worse as the day went on. I thought I was in the clear, because for the first four hours or so after the shot, I felt pretty normal. By 6 PM I started feeling a little bit gross. I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but I wasn't feeling great and couldn't raise my arm at all. By seven I started feeling feverish, took my temperature, and I had a low-grade fever in the 99s, and progressively started feeling a little more gross. By 8:30 PM I had a full-blown fever and it was climbing. I was starting to get nauseous and extremely fatigued and decided to take something to help me sleep which did not work. I started having body pain and aches all over with chills. Arm felt like it couldn't raise at all. Pain radiated all the way up my neck and down into my hand, plus a bonus pain across my shoulder blade! By 10 PM I had a 102 temperature and was absolutely miserable. I was so nauseous I had to take a Zofran and couldn't even sip water. I had chills and body aches so bad, and I was questioning all of my life choices, and trying to remind myself that this would be way better than getting an outbreak of shingles. I knew I just had to soldier through it but man it sucked. Realized in the middle of the night my body gave me the beautiful gift of a second period on top of it all! Felt incredibly blessed.

3956,"I finally got it!: After being turned down 3 times by my hospital for the COVID vaccine, I finally found someone to give it to me! Backstory- I've had several anaphylactic reactions to flu shots over the years as well as the shingles vaccine last year. When the vaccine first came out, the hospital and my doctor had a wait and see reaction for me. They wanted more data. Fair enough. Asked again this summer,still no one seemed too bothered about me not getting the shot. Then my hospital made it mandatory. Figured I'd finally be able to get it. Surgeons and anesthesiologists I work with suggested getting an IV beforehand (I'm a hard stick) and having someone on standby in case of severe reaction. I asked employee health if we could do this. Big nope for me. Told just to file for an exemption. Really? I'm willingly to go thru all this but they can't be bothered? Finally contacted my old doctor (would still be with him if he hadn't dropped my insurance). He was willing! Set up the necessary precautions and even got the J&J shot so I wouldn't have to go thru this twice. Not ideal I know, but I was just excited to get anything! Anyway, day finally arrives. Everyone's all prepared. I get the shot. And within about 10 minutes muscles start to get rigid and itchy welts start to appear. But no breathing issues thankfully. 300mg of IV Benadryl and 3 hours later I get to go home still itchy and some muscle issues. But I got it! I'm just so relieved and thankful for my doctor being willing to try. Worth the week of hives and itching. Oh, to be a child again when nothing bothered me. If I could just stop finding new allergies as I get older, I'd be ecstatic. EDIT: Thank you for the awards and the support. For those of you sending me nasty PM's, please stop. The doctor who treated me was my PCP for 16 years and very familiar with how to treat me. If it wasn't an insurance issue, I'd still be with him. My current doctor has seen me once and is clueless about my history as is employee health. I've been bullied since the vaccine came out at work and here because I haven't been able to get it.

7599,Rashes on body after seeing girlfriend: 19m saw my girlfriend yesterday and I've usually had red spots after sex and cuddling with her but it was very minor. Never itched and was never not even close to what I have now. Woke up this morning and I am covered from my face to my stomach. It's a little itchy in some spots but not really that itchy. What is it and what can I do about it? <url>,0
469,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I had one case of shingles in my mid-thirties- a few blisters that started just below my throat and trailed up around to the back of my neck and into my hairline- basically following th one nerve that had it. I could not wear a real shirt for days, it was beyond painful, and that was just ONE STRAND. I can't imagine if it had spread or gotten into my eyes, etc.",0
5026,"How long does this sharp pain last?: I'm still recovering, but your progression sounds a lot like mine. It took about a week for the nerve pain to start to ease off. The gabapentin definitely helped with the pain more than anything else. I'm almost 3 weeks out from the start of the pain and am starting to have more pain free time than bit, though the itching has started. But I'll take the itch over the nerve pain any day!",0
854,"Sacral Nerve Shingles and Secondary Urine Retention: True! But even then, chickenpox/shingles seems to effect people differently -- it's not even like everyone who's had chickenpox is fated to get shingles! Surely every healthy human being experiences stress; why -- all things being equal -- would some humans develop shingles, but some go their entire lives without it? Maybe if we knew more, we could be a little better about preventing it. The medicines that treat autoimmune diseases are lifesavers, but definitely have their drawbacks. :(",0
3974,"Shingles on back, family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: I wore bandages for my own comfort. If I bumped up or rubbed my shingles against something it would hurt like a ****** but the band-aids provided just enough protection to prevent the pain. Also if they get oozy then your clothes will stick to the oozy spots and make a stain. And I'm sure your family doesn't want that on any of their furniture if it goes through your clothes.",0

First in January, then in April following the J&J (might be a coincidence) then in October following the flu shot (might be a coincidence). I react to basically all antivirals, abx, antifungals, and opioids, so there's not much the doctor can offer to treat it. CBD/THC are problems, too.

Went to see my provider, diagnosed with shingles. The pain is bearable taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. Anyone have an experience with shingles while on Humira?",0

It's my understanding if you have never had chicken pox, you are not likely to get shingles. Again, check with your Dr. I personally have never had chicken pox, however did have the titters.

5792,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: Oh yeah... I managed to get them in my 20s. I was going through a divorce and my doctor speculates it was the amount of stress I was experiencing that caused it. Still, being in my 20s it was a relatively mild case.

Is it a big deal not to get it before JAK inhibitors? I don't want to go through the months long hustle of getting a multi dose vaccine. However, the shingle virus reactivation prospect seems horrifying enough. Just want to hear from you guys here while I ask more questions to my doctor. Thanks!",0

1776,Hairy white caterpillar (Northern Virginia): Found this little guy crawling on the roof of my shed while I was putting up the last of the shingles. I recently saw a few posts about fuzzy/hairy type moth caterpillars (I'm blanking on the name) that can cause certain people to have some seriously painful reactions when they are touched. The region I am in is apparently within the zone those can be found. Anyone know what this one is and if I should be wary of them?,0
3537,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I'm a late Gen X, closer to millennial really but, weirdly, I got shingles in my 20s..... it was hard to diagnose at the time b/c I didn't fit the profile for shingles.

7162,"Some viruses live in our bodies indefinitely. Do we develop antibodies to them? Is there a constant battle between them?: Some viruses like HSV-2 and HPV and varicella-zoster, will live in human bodies indefinitely. Do bodies make antibodies to these viri and continually fight them? In the case of HPV, there is a vaccine. Does it effectively help destroy the virus from the body of the vaccinated when first encountered? How does that vaccine behave when administered to someone who already has the HPV virus?",0
6753,"Are shingles contagious?: Shingles are not contagious - meaning someone is not going to break out with shingles if they touch your toddler. Varicella zoster virus, which is responsible for a shingles outbreak, is contagious and anyone who has not been previously exposed to VZV is at risk of having a chickenpox outbreak. The virus can live in the environment for several hours so it's important to take precautions as you could potentially spread the virus from your toddler to your newborn who could break out with chickenpox.",0

He initially told me I would not qualify for my med (Rinvoq) without the vaccine - but I went around him and talked to the pharmacy center and got approved anyway. I did not want to get the vaccine. Same story as yours - never had chickenpox, got the vax as a kid. Anyway, I failed Rinvoq in the first three days due to horrible Crohn's reaction to it. Totally flared up like crazy.

I have my military medical records and they say ""exempt"" for MMR and varicella. I think my question is: does it say exempt because I most likely got them as a child? I don't remember giving a shot record to my recruiter when I joined. Aren't these usually the shots we get in basic and wouldn't that be on the immunization record if I did?",0
1928,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: I was taking up to 150mg a day due to the anxiety issue. Some people can't take 10 mg and function. They tried propanol first but beta blockers caused my first gout attack. Since using clonidine no anxiety. As time goes, I have been able to reduce the clonidine. It takes time for your body to adjust to the amitriptyline. Many people don't give medications a chance. Everyone is different but it can take weeks before you know if it works for you.!!",0

4744,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had actual shingles, had scabby skin lesions all over my face from upper lip to my ear, with a really bizarre combo of pain and itching.

6341,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: No, it's actually the opposite. But I don't think they knew that when we were young. If you have had the chicken pox, the virus never leaves your body and stays dormant. It can then come back as Shingles. They recommend people who don't think they had the chicken pox to still get the Shingles vaccine *because* it's possible that people had exposure but just never got symptoms.

The Shingles vaccine (Shingrix) was done at the local Pharmacy in two doses. You have to wait a few weeks between shots. Got the COVID and Flu shots at the same time in opposite arms. Did not hit me at all, and felt fine afterward. Not sure if that is good or bad? I would space out the vaccines and do the Shingles shots whenever you want, because they are not seasonal like the flu shots.",0

He said it was strange that I wasn't in pain and asked if I wanted meds just in case. I agreed. Few days later, I awoke in the middle of the night to some of the worst pain imaginable. Was so happy I had those pills. It was awful.",0

I suffer from a pretty severe allergy to perfume, but only with hay fever like symptoms. Sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes. No skin reactions at all. I've also had some diseases in the past that made my doctor concerned that I might be immunocompromised. I had shingles at 16, and a few years ago I had legionnaires. Is there a condition or genetic predisposition that could explain why I have such bad allergies and seem to catch these diseases that usually only affect the weak?

I haven't changed detergents, soaps etc and can't think of any reason why this would have appeared on my face. Does this look like the start of chicken pox or shingles?",0

I'm extra sad though because I had been feeling GREAT the last 3-4 days, and nearly 90% yesterday. My pacing was working and I loved having a string of good days.

Constant aching, burning muscles, weakness, extreme fatigue, inability to sleep, etc. this is not my usual baseline nor is it what PEM feels like. PEM feels more manageable and ""bodily"" whereas this feels more, ""illness"". Did I totally screw myself and my progress by getting this scan?

We're sleeping separately so she can have all the pillows in her third trimester of pregnancy (our first) so we feel especially useless for each other at the moment, and she feels especially helpless when she slaps on a glove to hurt me with the hella thick antiviral cream. In it all, try not to forget your sense of humor, and here's to as short of breakouts as possible!",0
5667,"Herpes zoster vaccination: Hello! (male, 18, white, 180 cm, 80 kg, non smoker, no medications, had herpes zoster recently on my torso, no other ilnesses) I have a question regarding herpes zoster. I don't understand why vaccination against herpes zoster is effective if someone already had herpes zoster infection before and now has immune cells defending him. The troublosome part for me is that when somebody gets infected for the first time he develops chicken pox symptoms, every other time he develops shingles. If my understanding is correct that means that one must have some memory cells active that remember herpes zoster virus for the whole duration of his lifetime. If i had herpes zoster recently can i equate that to vaccination? Also my doctor told me to take 1 valtrex a day for half a year to remove traces of virus from your body, I want to know if this is a common practice and if it is neccesary I want to thank you for your answer in advance. (and apologise if it is a stupid question :)",0
3371,"I [23M] thought I had chicken pox as a kid, but...: Recently, I had a change of employment to healthcare and part of the requirements had me both submit vaccination records and be tested for immunizations. No problem, I was up to date on everything except my TDAP had expired in March. Got that during my health appointment. It's been 9 days and I get a letter in the mail. The formatting looks pretty standard to alert patients about immunity gaps. And mine came back with ""Varicella"". I'm going to be a receptionist (and not a medical professional) and didn't know what that was, but I knew I had seen the term before. One short Google search later, I realize it's the chicken pox. My mom took pictures of everything, including me with chicken pox. Or what we thought was chicken pox. How likely is something like VZV adjacent viral infections to be confused in groups of children (non medically diagnosed) like my siblings and I? How likely is it given that it would have been around 2000-2002? Can you lose immunity and does that affect your shingles outlook? I plan on getting the vaccine when I can, but I'm baffled by how this could have happened. I'm curious as if it is likely we didn't get the chicken pox, I'll need to let my siblings know to get theirs.",0
4373,"How to Perform Roof Shingle Replacement Effectively: Roof shingle replacement is a task that requires proper tools, safety measures, and skills. Here are some steps to perform it effectively: * Identify the damaged shingles and remove them carefully with a pry bar or a hammer. * Check the condition of the roof deck and flashing underneath the shingles. Replace or repair any rotten or damaged parts. * Cut the new shingles to fit the size and shape of the old ones. You can use a utility knife or a circular saw for this. * Apply roofing cement or nails to secure the new shingles in place. Make sure they overlap with the adjacent shingles and align with the roof line. * Seal the edges of the new shingles with roofing cement or caulk to prevent water leakage. By following these steps, you can perform roof shingle replacement effectively and extend the life of your roof.",0
2907,"Getting the shingles vaccine before starting Rinvoq: My derm suggested getting the shingles vaccine (Shingrix) before I start rinvoq for eczema on my face and neck that I can't get under control. There is some time period after getting the shingles vaccine where you shouldn't take Rinvoq...maybe a couple weeks, maybe a month? Does anyone happen to know? I am currently 36 so I'm not at great risk for Shingles yet, but shingles is listed as a common side effect of rinvoq. My dermatologist is out of town at the moment. My rinvoq prescription was approved, and I'm eager to start because my eczema has been quite bad this year, but holding off until I can figure out if I should get vaccinated for shingles first. I don't think most places will give you the shingles vaccine if you're under 50 unless in cases like this. The vaccination might need to be pre-approved by a doctor before I can get it. PS is Rinvoq good at clearing up eczema patches or more so just to stop the itching? Because itchyness has never been a huge problem with my eczema, luckily. I saw a commercial for rinvoq and eczema wasn't even mentioned in it so I dunno, I know the medication has multi uses. Also hoping it helps with general body inflammation, any idea if it does? Sorry for all the questions, thanks.",0
653,"Can i cold turkey prednisone?: So my doctor prescribed me prednisone at a taper dose: 20 mg for 4 days, 15 mg for 4 days, 10 mg for 4 days, then finally 5 mg for 4 days I've taken prednisone for 5 days now and i'm looking to stop because of the side effects ( insomnia, moon face ) Only problem is if i quit cold turkey will i experience any negative side effects? I saw online that if i don't follow my taper schedule i can mess up something about my adrenal glands which i obviously do not want happening, but at the same time everything i read online was for long term use of prednisone.

7002,"Shingles Vaccine?: the 2/1000 figure i posed is surviellence data from the CDC's website. Its based on a sample of people in that age range (ie, they look at the sample and compare how many people had shingles compared to the sample size). More recent data from 2019 (also linked on the CDC website) seems to show about 3/1000 for the age group of 30-39, and about 4/1000 for 40-49. 50-59 is about 7-8/1000. Quite a jump even from the 40-49 to the 50-59 group I don't think the particular data I am viewing is stratified for people with a known history of chickenpox infection. But, chickenpox history is almost universal in people who are in their late 30s and older today, as the varicella vaccine only came out in 1995 in the US. By all means, ask your doc. Certainly, if you had chickenpox as a kid, there is some potential for shingles, as prior infection is a necessary precondition to shingles.",0
7693,"PSA: Flu shot: Along with your flu shot, please also consider getting your Twinrix (Hepatitis A & B), Gardasil 9 (HPV) and Tdap booster, if applicable. In most cases, you do not need to go to your doctor and can get these along with your flu shot at most pharmacies without a prescription. #Twinrix and Gardasil 9 are the only vaccines to protect you from getting some STDs and many types of cancer. Most insurance, such as MassHealth, Fallon and Blue Cross Blue Shield will pay 100% of the cost. If you know someone 50 or over, please ask them to consider getting their Shingrix (shingles) vaccine.

4133,"Shingles from a flu shot: This is just a story I thought Skeptic might enjoy: Over the winter, the topic of flu shots came up in conversation with a friend of mine. Friend: We don't do flu shots in our household... [Wife] got shingles from a flu shot. Me: But shingles is from the same virus as chicken pox... I very much doubt a flu vaccine would have any reason to contain that. Friend: Her doctor said the vaccine caused it because of the medication she's on. Then it clicked. His wife has a condition that requires that she be on immuno-supressants. I'm not a doctor, but I figure that something that challenges an already weak immune system would make it easier for another infection, shingles in this case, to take hold. I wasn't going to change his mind, but his doctor should have taken the time to explain what happened. Having the whole household skip the vaccination is exactly the wrong reaction. With an immuno-compromised person amongst them, he and their son should be ensuring that they get the shots to help wall her off from potential sources of a flu infection. For most people getting the flu is no fun, but ultimately harmless. For her it could be a serious problem. No real moral to all of this, but I like the story as it explains at a personal level the idea of how herd immunity works and why it is important.",0
873,"Have any of you ever been granted coverage for the Shingles vaccine?: [PA, US] I have excellent health insurance through my new employer. However, it's pretty standard for health insurance plans to not cover the shingles vaccine until you're 55. I am currently in my mid 30's. I had my first shingles outbreak when I was 13. I have struggled with these outbreaks on and off ever since. My PCP gives me Valacyclovir to help when I have an outbreak, but it obviously doesn't prevent them. I always have to wait until they go away on their own. A representative aty current health insurance company told me it's possible they would cover the cost of the vaccine if I am approved for an exemption. But it's a long process and I work two jobs so I don't want to go through all of that if there's no point. The representative couldn't give me any insight on the approval or denial process. I would think that I'd be approved for an exemption since it's out of the ordinary for someone to have an outbreak in their teens. But I could be wrong. Has anyone ever gone through this process and had your insurance cover the cost of the vaccine before you're the required age?",0
4718,"Varicella Vaccine Requirements!: Hi I had a question regarding when varicella vaccines should be administered. I was told recently that my health screening/blood work (for a new job I got accepted to) does not indicate that I have immunity to varicella. (Vaccination for this is required for this job. I'm a nurse.) HOWEVER, I'm confused because my immunization record shows that I got the VAR in 1998 (I was born in 1997) and then got another VAR vaccine in 2009. From what I read online, I was supposed to get the second dose from age 4-6 but I got it when I was like 11 or 12. Does this explain why there is no evidence of immunity in my blood work? I also got two MMR vaccines. Now I don't know if I should go ahead and get the vaccines again even though I got them in 1998 and 2009 because there's no evidence of immunity. Any suggestions? I'll also be calling my doctor when they open up but was looking for answers now in the meantime. Thanks!",0
5706,"Probably a stupid question: This is probably a dumb question, but I'd rather get the answer from a dr then just everyone telling me it's fine. I am 7 months pregnant. I was put on Famotidine for the ungodly heartburn I've been experiencing. About a week into taking it I developed shingles. I stopped taking the famotidine originally thinking I was having an allergic reaction to it, and then once I was diagnosed with shingles was put on other meds and didn't want to overload my system. I have completed the antivirals prescribed for the shingles and they have mostly cleared up. My heartburn however is back in full force, everyone is telling me to just start taking the famotidine again, but now I'm nervous it'll cause another break out. Logically I know that it's very unlikely that taking the pill caused the shingles, and that a second shingles outbreak is rare...but I have less than zero interest in going through this pain again. Is there any possibility that the famotidine caused the shingles or is it just an untimely coincidence that the outbreak started so closely to starting a new medication?",0

Noticed that hydrocortisone is on the list of medications to avoid prior to surgery- would this include topical hydrocortisone? I had assumed tablets but wanted to be sure. And in that same vein, would black seed oil (nigella sativa) be okay as a topical during these two weeks before surgery? I've read to avoid ingesting it before surgery, but wasn't sure about if using it externally also posed a risk. Just trying to throw anything at this dang rash to get it to subside.

I've had both a cold and covid since I've been on Tec, but I wasn't particularly sick from either, and cleared both a couple of days faster than my wife did, even though she got sick first. Given that I was working in a busy retail environment when I was diagnosed, it's one of the reasons why I chose Tec in the first place.

The rash is going away but now my joints ache from my hip to my groin and down my leg. It's so weird. When I have pain killers in me it's tolerable, when they wear off I start to cry.

1702,"The Travelling Graveyard: I live up in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. For those who don't know, it's a historical site when it comes to horror movies; being that it has the mall where they recorded the original Dawn of the Dead back in 1977. The town itself isn't that different from any other, but the type of people we (occasionally) get passing through can certainly be interesting. There's the occasional tourist group, horror convention, and several Romero tributes. All I'm saying is that we're pretty used to seeing weird stuff around here. Not, like, every day, but more often than I'd like to admit. So when I first saw a flier for something called ""The Travelling Graveyard"", I didn't give it a second thought. However, it happened to be taped to a wall just outside of the Indian restaurant where I waited in line for my Friday-night tikka masala, so I gave it a look. It took me a few seconds to even realize what it said. It was such a strange collection of words. Like raspberry shoes, hug missile, or bright black. I had to look closer. Kinda like you did when you clicked this. I took a picture of the flier, got my order, and made it back to my car. I could tell it was gonna rain. I spent some time checking the picture in my car, zooming in on the details I might've missed. The flier had a simple vector graphic style picture of a tombstone with an elderly couple standing behind it. They were leaning against one another, smiling, and looking straight forward. At first it looked fine, but once I zoomed in, I noticed little discrepancies. For example, they had too many teeth. I could count several rows of them. Another was that the woman in the picture, who at first looked like she was leaning on her husband, was actually grabbing him by the neck. ""The Travelling Graveyard"" it said, with ""Coming this Friday to Monroeville!"" printed in small letters underneath. There was an address, and a bunch of company logos at the bottom. Honestly, I didn't recognize any of them, but it looked legit; like some kind of sponsored event. I figured it might be a movie premiere, given the town's history. Lucky for me, the address was on my way home. I could swing by and just catch a glimpse. I hadn't heard of any big projects being filmed in",0
4196,"I have a GI Issue and am in constant waves of pain, advice needed: I'll start with a TLDR: My chronic lower abdominal pain has returned after years of being symptom-free and we don't know why. Local doctors haven't been much help. I can't get an appointment with a GI specialist for months, and ER docs are baffled. This is a rather complicated issue that requires a lot of background knowledge, so please read the below and tell me your thoughts! **Current Symptoms, etc:** I experience pain that flips between my lower abdomen and bottom right portion of my back; this can change every few hours or days. Generally, I'm in more pain in the mornings, and I feel relief in the hours after I eat and when I am active and digesting my food. Then, when the food goes down farther into my system, I'm in immense pain again (perhaps it is passing through a damaged area of my small intestine). The pain worsens if I am stationary. I feel as if my stomach is overproducing acid to mitigate the fact that maybe the nerves in my digestive system are not allowing my smooth muscle to digest my food properly. I suffer from constipation, and laxatives are barely helping. I haven't had a normal bowel movement since this all started. A CT scan showed an abnormally high amount of feces buildup in my rectum. I also suffer from nausea which sometimes leads to retching, especially in the morning. A recent fecal test showed extremely low levels of secretory IgA. A recent endoscopy came back showing no problems. Because of this and the fact that my pain is lower down, I believe the issue is in/around my small intestine. Whether it is the nerves or the intestine itself, I do not know. My urine sample is normal, blood sample is normal, and the CT scan was unremarkable apart from the fecal buildup. **Medical History:** I am a 58-year-old Caucasian male residing in the United States, weighing 165 lbs and measuring 6'1"". I am a non-smoker, and my medications are listed at the bottom of this post. In 2011, I was treated with antifungal medications (Diflucan and nystatin) for excess yeast in my stomach.

Case 14 An unknown metal-accumulation disorder. The patient was a 45-year-old female who presented to our emergency department with hematuria and severe pain in the groin and left-lower back. An X-ray revealed numerous radio-dense, oblong, irregular bodies in both kidneys, the largest of which measured 10 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm. The patient was diagnosed with kidney stones. As the largest stone was impacted in the wall of the renal calyx and had likely caused a perforation, it was decided to remove it laparoscopically. The surgery revealed a large and mostly smooth stone, dark brownish-black in color. It was removed without incident and sent to the lab for examination. The perforation in the calyx was sutured. There were no postoperative complications. However, the patient began complaining of malaise, muscle pain, and severe joint pain. She was running a fever of 101 F. She was empirically started on ceftriaxone for possible urinary tract or kidney infection. On Day 2, she asked to speak with the physician in charge of her case (the author).

People are always commenting on how fit I am yet all I do is walk my dogs and work around the house. I did tear off half a roof of shingles last week alone so I am a hard worker. The best I've ever slept was when I was riding a bike ten hours a day but that was a low paying job. I obviously am happy doing stuff. Eat very healthy because of stomach issues. Think Whole Foods. Meat. Lentils. Beans. Veggies. Whole grains. Milk. Love milk it helps me sleep. Regular menstrual cycle. I do have night sweats but I've had them since my twenties. They are very mild but lately they chill me to the bone. Scary cold. Off and on. Last few years. History of PCOS. Controlled with diet and exercise. Tinnitus. Methytion disorder. Atrovent for Asthma. Very rarely needed these days. Smoked cigarettes in the past in varying amounts for varying lengths of time. Always exercised though. Eating disorder from 15 to 25 which involved lots of drugs, diet, alcohol, exercise, cleanses, cooking at a macrobiotic restaurant. You name it I did it. Stopped dieting, went to therapy, and lost the weight. I do think the drugs have something to do with the insomnia. I'm super sensitive. And I didn't do a ton but I felt like they messed me up as far as sleep goes. They made me pee at night. Two cups of green tea in the am and no caffeine after. 500 mcg methylfolate, multi vitamin. Vitamin D. Digestive enzymes. Magnesium/calcium. I eat pot to help me sleep. It's no longer working and that is scary. I'm scared. I've never slept well. Ever. Before I found edible pot at 39 I could remember the four times I'd ever slept through the night. When I found pot wow. I slept 12 hours a night for the first six months. It was great. A godsend. Before I found pot, One time I got depressed over a guy for a month and slept a lot more than normal. I went from the worst student in my class to one of the top students. Then the insomnia came back and down went my grades. I've got my routine down. When things are going well I wake up around 6",0

I thought I had a pulled muscle and treated it as such but I had this weird spasm thing that in the back of my mind I was thinking this feels like nerve pain. I went to urgent care Friday night because it hurt so much. The doctor there also though it was a muscle strain and spasm and gave me a steroid shot and prescribed a muscle relaxer. The next morning I had a rash under my breast (exact spot of the pain on my back but I front). I thought it was an allergic reaction to the meds so back to urgent care. The same doctor took one look and said shingles. She prescribed me an antiviral (also took a swab of the blisters for lab test conformation) and sent me home. I still thought it was two things going on because my bank still hurt. However I just woke up in intense pain and noticed I now have blisters on my back in the same spot as the spasm. I took more Advil and am waiting for it to kick in so I can maybe go back to sleep. This pain is some of the worst I have ever felt. I am going to call my regular doctor on Monday (Tuesday since Monday is a holiday) and hope she has something better for the pain, or something to help me sleep. Any pro tips for pain? I don't have any itching yet, just pain. The pain wraps from under my breast to the my back where it started. Will I get a rash all along that band too? Or can I just have two disconnected rashes? I truly hate this. Luckily I work from home and am between projects so I am able to rest more than I would normally. But I am afraid this pain will last months or years. If you got this far.

7036,"Persistent multiple system problems: Short version of symptoms: Esophageal dysmotility (0% motility, swallowing intact), Diaphragm spasms (severe debilitating hiccups), Excessive stomach acid, Esophageal ulcer, Erectile dysfunction, Dizziness, Shortness of breath, Chest tightness Full story: 36 years old, 6', 180 lbs, active, healthy eating habits, non smoker For 20+ years, I have had sporadic episodes of severe intractable hiccups, usually triggered by carbonation, alcohol, or excessive laughter. They were often accompanied by stomach acid. Episodes ended when I went to sleep for the night. Stopped all carbonated beverages 15+ years ago. Stopped all alcohol 3 years ago. Starting 1 year ago, I had an episode of severe hiccups/diaphragm spasms with acid coming up. But it never stopped. It's been happening almost every day since. It often happens in the second half of the day. It has never involved vomiting or actual food coming up. The only thing that reliably calms the spasms is laying flat on my back. This is notably the opposite of how acid reflux works. Most, but not all, mornings are ok. Once it starts for the day, it continues until bedtime. The spasms can be set off by acidic or spicy foods, bending down, or strenuous movement, but usually are not. On most occasions, there is no discernable trigger. I avoid acidic and spicy things. I do not use any drugs or alcohol. I have fasted completely from all food and water, and still had spasms occur. I attempt to exercise to stay healthy, including 10 minute cardio and muscle-group HIIT routines. These do not trigger spasms, but if I'm already having spasms, I can't do them. The spasms temporarily calm during sex. If I'm having them, but manage to be intimate with my wife, the spasms stop during the activity, and return after. This makes me think there is a neurological issue, possibly enteric. But I'm not a doctor. I had an esophageal manometry that showed 0% motility of the esophagus, including the sphincter that separates esophagus from stomach. I was put on strong antacids. They sort of helped.

7659,"Itching and burning with no rash: I desperately need help figuring out what's wrong with my left thigh. I went to the beach on a Saturday and on Sunday evening my entire upper thigh began to itch intensely. It then developed into a painful, itching, and burning sensation. We were definitely bitten by small flies while on the beach, but after the beach we spent the rest of the day at a winery with pants on. We did wade into the water but it doesn't make sense that only my left upper thigh is itching and burning and not both of my entire legs. It's now Wednesday and the pain/itching is getting worse and spreading upwards to my hips and butt. I have NO rash. None. I have small bruise-like circles that aren't raised. They do hurt more than any other part of my leg. This is the closest thing to a bite. See photo. The rest of my leg looks completely normal, despite the itching and burning and aching across the entire thigh, front and back. I'll also get random pangs of pain in random areas on the thigh. Hydrocortisone cream 2.5% does nothing. Calamine lotion, oatmeal bath, Benadryl, Claritin, doing nothing. The only thing that helps is icing, but it comes back after a few minutes. This makes me think it's not an allergic reaction or it's something neurological? I haven't seen any actual bugs or larvae on me or my clothing. My boyfriend who I live with does not have any bites either so I don't think it's bedbugs. I've never had chicken pox so I don't think it's early stages of shingles. I have NO IDEA what this is. It almost feels like neuropathic itching, but it seems so unlikely as my friend who came to the beach with me is experiencing something similar... I did have a surgery on my nose a month ago but I don't think that would have anything to do with this. Could I have some sort of microscopic bugs attacking me? That can't be killed by a hot bath? Jellyfish sting that developed later?Something wrong with my blood or muscles? Like what is this?!?",0

I had to do overnight working and that lifestyle made my immune system weaken. I ate many many chocolate snacks during work. (Chocolate contains Arginine) And the multivitamin that I took contains Arginine, Maybe these 3 things triggered my shingles I've suffered chickenpox when I was 5, my sister got it first from kindergarten and I've got it from her. It was an epidemic to little kids in my country. My first shingles experience was when I was 23, me and my workout mate started to take Arginine supplement for muscle gain, but he didn't suffer chickenpox before, so his results were great, but I've got shingles on my around of feet. We were very thin boys at first, he didn't have a steroid shot but his muscle is quite bigger than mine now. I felt it's unfair cuz I had to quit Arginine supplement because of this damn shingles. Anyway, it wasn't painful at all cuz my age was early 20s. And now, I turned over 30, yes I've got painful itchy shingles, and it's severe, even the doctor said my case is severe for a young adult. I didn't know it was shingles because I originally had eczema, I thought it was just eczema, but I felt sharp pain suddenly. I've visited a neurologist and dermatologist 3 times each. My first clinic visit was when I suffer shingles for 5 days, the doctor said the golden time of treatment was gone and my treatment was too late. Cuz I didn't take antiviral in 72 hours. So I've got painkillers shot 3 times near the backbone, the doctor prescribed me antiviral, antiseizure, antidepressant, antiallergic medications (Yes, the doctor said I need to take these), and antiviral ointment. For 7 days. And in 2nd time of the clinic visit, the doctor prescribed me a painkiller, antiallergic medication, and steroid lotion. But I felt steroid lotion make it worse, make the skin thinner, I stopped applying it My backbone pain was gone but still have sensitive pain and itchiness on my shingles rashes.

Unfortunately I had it a few times prior but thought it was ringworm ?? until my mom said it was definitely shingles. I went to the doctor the following day where I was prescribed Acyclovir five times a day for seven days. The pain and blisters subsided but there was a very faint and minor rash. It was only red like someone spilled hot water on the area where the shingles previously lived. Fast forward four weeks, I noticed the very early stages of a blister forming. Went to the doctor right away (last Monday) and he prescribed me 800mg if Acyclovir five times a day for two weeks. I am on day seven today and I cannot stomach the acyclovir anymore. I have been having this feeling for the last two days but finally concluded today that it was the acyclovir. I woke up feeling amazing today, took an acyclovir and noticed it hurt my stomach really bad. After taking the second one about three hours later, shortly after I started sweating, stomach ache, dizzy, nauseous, overall achy, sore throat and wanted to sleep but was not tired at all. I have only taken two pills today because I am afraid to take another pill to get all those side effects.

4580,"A post on Waccines: This was actually a comment in another thread, but I thought it would be also useful as post. Because of the rotten & unsafe COVID waccines which I did take 2 shots of & now repent badly, I have looked up a few waccines in the last year or so. 1) **HPV** waccine - it's a rotten waccine (all the different ones **Gardasil**, **Cervarix** etc etc) - it doesn't really give any significant protection against Cervical Cancer. And it has a lot of neurological & other adverse effects - <url> - <url> - <url> I have an oncologist friend who doesn't recommend HPV waccine to anyone though she is generally pro childhood waccines - this is what actually made me want to investigate further. 2) **Chickenpox/Varicella** - it's not particularly an unsafe waccine & it does work, but it's an absolutely not required waccine. I won't give it to my kids. UK NHS till now didn't offer it in their childhood schedule - i.e. if someone in UK had to get the chickenpox varicella waccine, they can't get it through NHS like all the other childhood waccines. They have go to a private provider and pay for it - i.e. most in UK do not get this waccine. However, during COVID, pharma got a lot of influence (read corruption) with NHS, so now NHS is planning to make this unrequired waccine as part of childhood schedule. Denmark also doesn't have the chickenpox (varicella wacciine) in their childhood schedule. Denmark is probably the least corrupt country in the world. Other than this, any child which gets the chickenpox waccine is protected from chickenpox, however it increases his chances of getting Shingles as an adult. Chickenpox is a harmless disease. However, Shingles is worse - it's quite painful for some days 3) **Tetanus** waccine is quite safe (though like all waccines has some rare adverse effects). However, a trusted doctor told me that it's not required every 5 or 10 years. 2 shots of the waccine more or less gives you robust & long lasting immunity.

2369,"Dear Anti-Vaccination Movement: I have a few things to say. I'm the Mother of a child with Autism. I had my son vaccinated. Correlation does not equal causation. Just because a person receives the MMR vaccination around the same time parents notice signs of Autism, does not mean the two are related. My son has challenges every day. Every day I wrap him up in clothes so he can't scratch himself, I go through playing with him when he won't look at me. We go to the grocery store and people tell me things like ""He's so spoiled"" or ""Isn't he a brat!"" when I try to explain (Which I shouldn't have to) I'm met with ""Oh he doesn't look like he has Autism"" or my favorite story. ""Oh I had a nephew with that, he grew out of it."" No. My son has Pica, he can't speak, he ignores other children, doesn't have any interest in animals and screams like a howler monkey when he is overstimulated. He is not growing out of it. Even if he has speach therapy for a decade or more and becomes great at speaking, that doesn't mean he will magically ""Get better"". No Vaccines do not CAUSE this and if you're one of those people who cling to the ""facts"" you dug up on youtube from some celebrity then feel free to delete yourself from my planet. You've taken up air long enough, you're probably a trump supporter, and I need you to leave now. At least a decade of fact driven research have proven no correlation between MMR and Autism.

This tiny human that I take care of 24/7, that I nurture and am doing EVERYTHING I possibly can for. Does it make you feel better to bully me, because you read an article on the internet that made you a self appointed expert on Autism. No, shut up.

More prevention and protection. To stop taking this virus lightly and downplaying it. This is to advocate for a cure and better treatments. Please educate yourselves - this virus IS a big deal. It's time for action. 1. Neonatal The global incidence of neonatal herpes has been estimated to be around 10 cases per 100,000 live births which is equivalent to about 14,000 cases per year. Neonatal infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a devastating complication of genital herpes during pregnancy. It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality: untreated, the case-fatality rate is estimated to be 60%.1, 2 Even with antiviral treatment, mortality rates and lasting neurological impairment remain substantial, especially for neonates with CNS disease (about 30% of cases) and disseminated disease (25% of cases) compared with those with skin, eyes, and mucosa disease (around 45% of cases) 2. Bell palsy There has been increasing acceptance of HSV-1 and varicella zoster virus as the cause of Bell palsy. Other infectious diseases have been implicated as well. 3. Increased Risk of HIV Infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of HIV acquisition 2- to 4-fold compared with patients without HSV-2 infection,20increases the risk of transmitting HIV to partners, and accelerates the progression of HIV infection to AIDS 4. Meningitis Aseptic meningitis occurs in 36% of women with primary HSV-2 genital infection and 13% of men5; it results in hospitalization for 6.4% of infected women and 1.6% of infected men. Recurrent aseptic meningitis due to HSV-2 may occur with or without symptomatic herpetic mucocutaneous disorder. The manifestations of this disorder are identical to that observed with primary genital herpes.8In 1 series, recurrent meningitis has been observed in 19%8to 42%9of patients who experience meningitis with their first episode of genital herpes 5. Neurological complications Although HSV-1 has a predilection for the development of encephalitis after intracerebral injection in the mouse model, HSV-2 generally causes meningitis.

Today along with a new shampoo, she's prescribed me cyclosporine oral, though she said the max she wants me to take it is a month and she thinks it'll clear up my scalp before then (to the point that the new shampoo and careful washing and the like will finally make progress.) I guess my first question would be if there's anything you all would recommend I avoid. I did some googling on drug sites and the like that said I should avoid Zantac and grapefruit (dammit on both counts!), but I didn't know if you all had any bad experiences with foods/OTC medicines. I read that it can hit your kidneys pretty hard, and as someone who pretty much gets UTI's if a dust particle looks at me wrong, I'm a bit worried about that.

Not only do I always seem to pick up bugs from people on a GOOD day, but the university I'm attending/working at has had some outbreaks of chickenpox because of students who refused to get vaccinated, and according to their alerts, even though I'm vaccinated it could hit me.

She popped up on my FB last year mid-August serendipitously as I was planning for my nuclear exit from my marriage to ""J."" She became the *other woman* as it were. Our conversations got heavy, quickly, at my direction because she became the target for my sexual energy (""J"" was as far from that as a 5-armed sea creature can get.) She was aware of my situation from the get go (it's how we started talking). She was very helpful in outlining the steps I should take legally and logistically. Being in the middle of a divorce herself, she had all that knowledge fresh. So she was basically this *virtual FWB* who offered advice from time to time. We haven't done anything to date... even back in HS. We literally have no romantic or sexual history. I construct training plans for ""A"", now. She lives 500 miles away from me. She is a sponsored obstacle course racer. She also has SLE (Lupus) which only flares up during times of stress. Our interactions are friendly at best, professional for the most part; I discuss her training protocols, ask about her health as it applies to the training and throw in questions about her kids and general ""how are you these days"" sorts of discussions. Nothing heavy, sexual, or anything approaching that. I don't even flirt with her in a way I would with any other female acquaintance. ""J"" is aware of her, my interactions with her, but insists we ""we talk about everything"" and have ""deep conversations"" etc. None of this is true, anymore.

She told me she needed to put her training on hold until she secured a place, schools for her kids, etc. The stress of this sudden change was causing her Lupus to flare which apparently comes in the form of shingles. **So on to the Comfort Test #1** ""J"" was",0
503,"I beat cancer but my eating disorder is slowly killing me.: Almost 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I was 20 years old at the time and a sophomore in college. The signs had been there for quite a while, I just didn't think cancer should be on my radar. Stress makes people tired. Tired people aren't hungry and they lose weight. It felt like a normal body reaction to the chaos surrounding me. After all, my parents 30 year marriage was collapsing due to my father's affair. There was fighting, shouting and threats. To top it off, I was also facing marital problems of my own. In a moment of pure stupidity I had gotten married. Then I realized I didn't want to be married and asked him for a divorce. He denied it. I didn't have money for a lawyer, much less for what now looked like a litigious divorce. I'd cry myself to sleep and shove handfuls of Advil down my throat to make the pain go away. Real, physical pain, all over my body. Life was messy and difficult but there was a glimpse of hope inside of me that things were going to get better, somehow, someway. Except they didn't. When you're already at rock bottom, you don't think things can get any worse. I went to the doctor because a grapefruit sized lump showed up on my collarbone and became a cancer patient, just like that. Since it was pretty widespread, I was biopsied the following day, Pet scanned, bone marrow biopsied, the works. Blood cancer. I was 20 and my blood was poisoned. Protocols were discussed, chemo was started. 16 full rounds, every pair counting as one cycle, every other week. For the first time I realized that things might not be OK. I might actually die. And if I was going to die, I deserved my dying wish: a divorce. I cried real tears of joy when my then husband said he'd do whatever I wanted; he'd give me the divorce and take care of everything. I might die, but I'd have my name back and I'd be free from him. On top of that, my parents patched up their marriage overnight the second they heard I was sick. Maybe they were just putting on an act for me, maybe they worked things out. I never quite figured it out.

I am actually waiting for one more estimate, but I am hoping whatever I learn here will help me evaluate that last one. I have confirmed BBB, business license, and General Liability and Workers Comp for each of them. In my state there is no roofer's license, and they only need a contractor's license above a certain amount, which I am well below. 2 story, 10/12 slope, 25.00 units. No chimney.

Also, I re-ordered the items to be in the same order to make it easier to compare - I assume the order it appears on the estimate doesn't really matter. **What is your take on the estimates below?** Here is my own list of what I am looking for. What am I missing? * Labor warranty * Protect home and landscaping * Tear off and dispose of existing roofing material * Repair damaged decking * Starter shingles * Drip edge * Ice and water shield in valleys and penetrations * Synthetic underlayment * Utilize marking lines and button caps on Underlayment * Architectural shingles * Replace pipe boots and vents as needed * Ridge vent * Ridge shingles * Clean up, remove, and haul away debris * Triple sweep for yard nails # 1. Owens Corning Duration - $8,605 * *Subcontracts the crew* * 12 year labor warranty * Protect landscaping,",0
