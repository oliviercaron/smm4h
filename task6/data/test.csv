4,"Just got my flu shot last month and now I'm experiencing some strange symptoms. I've been feeling really fatigued and achy, almost like I have the flu again. Has anyone else experienced this after getting the flu vaccine?"
9,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I would say there is also a covid connection here. I an 89 millennial caught chickenpox as a child. I then last year caught covid and had a lingering cough that lasted for weeks. As soon as it went Shingles developed. I think my body was so exhausted from fighting covid that shingles developed.
10,"""Vaccine reaction causing shingles reoccurrence?"": After experiencing shingles on my breast, under my armpit, and back in January, I recently received my second dose of the Covid vaccine. Now, I'm feeling the same tingling and shooting pain in the exact same area as before. Could this be another shingles outbreak triggered by the vaccine, or is it possible that it's just residual pain from my previous episode? No rash has appeared yet, so I'm unsure of the cause. Has anyone else had a similar experience after getting vaccinated?"
11,I am a 34F and 14 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby. I get a lot of my healthcare through the VA so I Have got some significant musculoskeletal injuries. But I Have been cleared as healthy when it comes to my immune system and the like. My primary care clinic just called and told me I Am overdue for a shingles vaccine. I was totally confused because I thought that was just for people over like 50. I pushed back and was told I still ought to get it but they will check my record to see if I got it in the military. The military does not pump the shingles vaccine into anyone under 50 so again I Am confused. Is there some new development on shingles vaccine recommendations? I cannot find anything different from what I originally thought when I Google. After my father almost went to the ER for how bad his side effects were from the vaccine I Am not super stoked on getting it in the event the VA cannot read or something.
12,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles when I was 27. I went to my dermatologist because I thought I was having a bad eczema reaction on my skin. Nope Shingles My doctor thought it was onset because I was going through a stressful time in my life which may have suppressed my immune system enough to flare it up. Luckily it was a very mild case on the left side of my chest but it was still irritating and did not really go away until about 2 months later.
15,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I went to one but for some weird reason no one in my family has ever had chicken pox. Maybe I Am weirdly and randomly immune but going into nursing school I was required to get the full series because my serum varicella was negative.
16,Shingles vaccine experience: 69yr old here. I got the vaccination. The thought of Shingles terrifies me. The only reaction I had was a sore arm. Not even that sore.
20,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1993 Kindergarten. I remember sitting in class and suddenly felt like something had bit me on the back of my neck turns out it was the first area of my pox. I remember Calamine from head to toe epsom baths I Am sure there was more. Born in 88. They rolled out the vaccine around 1994 I believe. My sister was born in 95 and the vaccine was part of her newborn immunizations.
21,Apparently I Have had this on my skin before according to my bf but this is probably the largest I Have ever had it and its slightly itchy. If not shingles what else does it look like?
24,I had the same except pneumonia shot instead of shingles. I thought Id die during the night. My internist said I was crazy. His nurse said never do 3 at the same time.
26,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: Learned this the hard way. I had not redone my Gardasil because I believed marriage was some kind of shield. Found out my husband of a decade was cheating for who knows how long. Went to get an STD panel and found cancer on my cervix and uterine lining. Got a divorce and a total hysterectomy. Get your vaccine.
29,Shingles vaccine: I got it as soon as I turned 50. No issues. I would watched both my grandma's need hospitalization due to Shingles complications. One covered her eyes and she almost lost her vision.
34,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Your Insurance MAY cover the shingles vaccine if you develop shingles in your 30s. I had this weird painful rash all over my legs and it was spreading all over my chest and back as well. It was so painful to wear clothes and I went to the ER because I had zero idea what it was. I thought it was a flesh eating bacteria or something. Never even thought of shingles because I was not elderly. Insurance then covered the vaccine when I asked my PCP about it since I already had a breakout even though I had not even turned 40 yet. I guess they did not want me in the ER again.
35,Shingles vaccine: I have never gotten more than a sore arm from any vaccine including the shingles vaccine I have known several people that did get shingles and trust me whatever misery you are imagining with the vaccine does not compare to the actual disease. It is like chickenpox on meth during a highspeed chase with a full tank of gas while listening to Roseanne Barr sing the National Anthem after eating a bad order of shawarma and you are wearing white after labor day... In a panic you grab that open apple juice and after a big gulp turns out to be cousin Jethro's dip spit bottle. Good luck.
38,Shingles vaccine: My first Shingex was the rough one second one not so bad. I would be a little hesitant about getting it right before a holiday that is going to keep you busy. That said definitely a good idea to get this vaccine.
42,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: My aunt lost one of her eyes to Ocular Shingles. It was a gruesome and grueling experience for her to go through. The outbreak occurred during the final stages of illness and loss of her husband. She never fully recovered from the experience. I had no hesitation about getting the shots but I have been fortunate that the only side effect I have ever had from a vaccine has been slight muscle soreness from tetanus booster booster.
45,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Thanks for sharing I Am being induced later today and definitely feel reassured as well by my decision to get vaccinated. I got mine around 3233 weeks pregnant. Did Not have any side effects and my baby has been passing every test with flying colors so far.
49,My shingles vaccine hit me hard for a few days as well. I still had the text from a friend whose shingles got into their face and eye so I had comfort foods and time to rest planned already.
50,I figured some of you might have some insight. I just jumped from 1gkg to 2 gkg IVIG administered over two consecutive days each month. I had been at 1gkg for 14 months. Covidinduced SFN with secondary Raynauds dysautomnia orthostatic hypotension allodynia all that jazz. I tolerated my first double dose in October relatively well. Did all the right stuff hydration antihistamines Tylenol. This last one ended Friday I prepped the same and had saline dumped into me along with the IVIG. I Am flaring like crazy. Allodynia and neuropathy in legs and feet are brutal. My tinnitus thanks shinglescovid brutal. I Have seen around and my friend Chat GPT told me that IVIG can because transient neuropathy flares. I Am dejected. Hoping some of you might have insight here. I Am coming on two years sick and I Am doing my best to take it day by day but it is difficult. I Am hoping for recovery but the longer this stays I suspect it gains permanency.
51,Immunosuppressant biologics and vaccines: I got the flu shot yesterday and felt fine. I will get COVID 10 days after my next biologic injection. Shingrix was not that bad not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I put off that second shot forEVER but could not wait any longer. Side effects were minor. I never get more than one vaccine at a time. I do not think I will be getting the pneumonia shot. Have not decided yet. But I definitely follow my rheumatologist's recs to get all vaccines. I had COVID last August for the first time and it lasted 18 days. I will avoid that at all costs if I can help it. Masking up
52,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep And worse off I got mine about 3 months before the vaccine was release for chicken pox and I got them so badly I ended up in the hospital for just under a week. I was 6. Crash my bicycle at 23 and felt a lot of pain in one spot on my back full blown shingles. I still deal with residual pain over 10 years later. When I asked my doctor about getting the shingles vaccine since I Have already have them and never want them again I was told I was too young for the vaccine cool
54,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles when I was 30. It was awful. The most pain I Have ever been in. I could not even let a bedsheet touch my skin. The blisters went into my lady bits. Nothing like soaking in epsons salt for days on end. I got both of the shots when I turned 50. No question about it. The shots hurt but not as bad as shingles.
56,There has been an increase in shingles cases since the Covid vaccine roll out it seems.
60,RSV Shot opinions: I am not in a country that offers it but we are going in to summer. However I have gotten flun and Tdap and next week get a Covid booster as well. It is for the baby yes but also for myself and my household. With my first we got Covid 6 weeks PP my husband was so unwell and nearly needed hospital with it. I was feeling dreadful and having to do all the newborn stuff alone. My mum was a life saver and moved in to help despite the risk. I do not want the same experience again but now with a toddler.... so yeah doing all we can do avoid it.
62,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles twice in my late 30s early 40s. The nerve pain was maddening. The insurance would not cover a vaccine before age 50 so I paid out of pocket for the first generation vaccine. I still had a mild outbreak afterward. I was at the pharmacy on my 50th birthday getting Shingrix. I would prioritize paying for Shingrix out of pocket.
65,Has anyone had a Covid Vaccine or Booster lately?: I vaccinate but cannot recall when I last did. I Am On Enbrel and did not have any issues with the vaccine at all. Sore arm the next day but that was literally it. Did get Covid once a year ago and was decently sick but functional. Was on vacation and did not miss an activity. Just crashed hard when I got home. And soaked through pjs. I do recall that
66,ANYTHING is better than shingles. Took me 6 weeks to get over and still have lingering effects it was on the right side of my face and head. It led to hearing deficits in my right ear. Get the vaccine. I do every year. It can come back.
70,This may end up being lengthy so thank you to anybody who sticks through to the end. In 2005 I was 13 and contracted viral meningococcal meningitis. I was in the ICU for several days where it was very touchamdgo and then just regular room for another several days. There was a strand of something else that was unidentifiable and I was supposed to followup with an infectious disease specialist but for reasons unknown to me it never happened. I had been prone to headaches prior to the meningitis but afterwards I had horrible migraines almost constantly. Fast forward to 2012 and I had another bout of what we thought was meningitis. The ER doc started me on antibiotics before my spinal tap was even done. When ST came back there was no meningitis. Doc was flabbergasted. Another episode like this happened again in 2014 and no meningitis. Now to get into the odd part I suspect some kind of reaction to a strain of herpes. My life has been nutty and I am just to the point of where I can address all of these issues. But I had chicken pox several times as a child all within a 12month span. I also get gnarly cold sores and have had what I suspect was shingles once but I used a triple dose of my antivirals every single day and it went away within about a week. Now starting about 45 years ago I started to get a different kind of migraine. I had waited over a year for my appointment with a neurologist when COVID happened and then suddenly I could NOT get in. When these different migraines happen it is like an incredibly intense pressure in my head. Lots of pressure right at the base of my skull and behind my eyes. These migraines also last a LONG time like usually 10 days. And nothing brings relief. Not IVs not any triptan not steroids especially nothing OTC. Usually I just wake up after 1014 days and they are gone. What would you suspect from this? Obviously I am trying to see specialists but there is lots of varying reasons why it has not happened yet. Thank you
72,I have suffered from numerous respiratory infections recently and postponed some needed vaccinations while ill. Can I get a COVID booster and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus RSV vaccination at the same time?
74,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had shingles last summer and I was lucky it was a mild case I noticed early enough to get antiviral meds involved right away. There is a sub for it rshingles that is very active and I see posts from very young people and lots of people who have had it more than once. Some poor souls have had it multiple times. I am getting the vaccine as soon as I can.
76,Shingles from the Covid vaccine is what I am hearing everywhere....
85,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Apparently the first version of the vaccine was too mild so they added adjuvants to increase the potency. I have had one dose absolutely horrible frightening actually. Will not do a second. Will have some coverage from the first and that is my choice.
87,Getting Vaccinations SUCKS: There is also a likelihood of Epstein Barr reactivation in both C RPS and C OVID. I am a member of the EB V tr if ect a earlier onset mental illness C RPS and long C OVID. And yes the first shingles shot knocked me on my as s. 2 was not quite as bad.
89,Is it dangerous to catch the virus while immunocompromised?: I have been on Remicade since November. I have gotten a cold that seemed worse than usual and had me out of work for two days. And I got a really bad case of shingles. I may have developed shingles anyway. Who knows. I had not been vaccinated for shingles since I am not even 40 yet.
98,Shingles?: My son with untreated MC AS had shingles when he was 36 and an active professional. He also had a super bad case of chickenpox when he was little that he had to be hospitalized for. It certainly surprised his doctor that he got shingles at his age. He took the vaccine now though. Some year I will talk him into getting the MC AS properly diagnosed and treated. He s a scientist in the aerospace industry and has been ill his whole life. I think it makes him more skeptical than most. Do poke at your doctors about getting the vaccine if you can
99,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: born in 86 got it at elementary was given a vaccine as well as that one med that tastes like bubblegum oh and I have a circular indentation on the right side of my temple when my dumb butt decided to scratch it
101,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: In my 50s and kept putting it off. Got it on my face now have a huge scar across the end of my nose. Feel like an idiot...
104,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I got shingles at 45 and developed an autoimmune disease losing feeling in the right half of my body and it is ruined my life. I wish I could go back in time and take the vaccine.
113,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: I got shingles at 45 and developed an autoimmune disease, losing feeling in the right half of my body and it's ruined my life. I wish I could go back in time and take the vaccine."
118,Chickenpox VSV vaccine eliminates herpes outbreaks?: I had my first HSV 1 outbreak ever last may. Went to do blood work for a hospital job and learned that i lost my immunity to chickenpox and needed the V Z V. I took my first dose two days ago. I feel like if i would ve known that sooner a lot of things could ve been prevented. I m actually scared right now because i feel like i m getting another outbreak.
121,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I would count the socks as lucky. No intentional pox parties for me but I picked it up from another kid and just happened to be in a cast thanks to a broken wrist and arm. I still get phantom itches and have to remind myself that I can in fact scratch them. Shit was brutal. Not as brutal as shingles will be but at least I probably will not die.
122,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah shingles was not fun I could not sleep on my right side for 3 days while I healed.
123,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You have not had shinglesyet. That Is why you will get it though because you had chicken pox.
126,Just took my first dose about 20 minutes ago. What should I expect today?: I get pretty fatigued. I take mine on Friday nights so if there are any ill side affects its over the weekend
129,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Have had the vaccine The doctor recommended it when it came out since I never had chicken pox.
131,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: She got shingles after Covid as well. I am sorry to hear about all you have through.
133,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox at 6 months completely by accident. Then ended up with shingles at age 12. I Am 32 now and have since gotten the vaccine and have not had them again but I do still have the scar on my stomach to prove it
134,Shingles and other Vaccines: I have not gotten the shingles vaccine I will not be getting it. When I was small I had the most severe case of chicken pox. Mother told me even on my feet. I feel pretty well covered. I also do not get the flu vaccine and have not had the flu in 25 years. I got covid in its earliest days and breezed through it. I just recently got it again and am dealing with lingering respiratory symptoms. That I got the 1st vaccine for a couple of years ago. Sooo...
136,Hey So my story is back in November I started getting a rash on my torso above my stomach but under the breast area My doctor thought it was shingles at first but it started to spread by December to the opposite side same area though I started going to a dermatologist in either late December or early January. We tried a series of 3 or 4 cream steroids that did not work. The rash will flare up and stay for a week or so then it will calm down and start looking good only to flare back up. The rash also then spread to the armpit area closer to above the pec area We then did a patch test which determined I was allergic to Nickel and Propolis Beeswax related stuff. I changed pretty much everything I could to no results...Just the same schedule of the flare ups coming and going. I initially thought this was from me exercising because that was the area I would sweat the most from but I have stopped exercising for months now and still will get flare ups. When I would exercise the flare ups would be massive and much worse than they are without. My dermatologist has now started me on dupixent shots I am about a month in Has anyone had a similar journey or have any ideas or solutions that worked for you? I am 8 months into this and feel like I am going to have this for the rest of my life. I also started exercising back in September ish and was on a really good schedule. I was starting to lose weight and really liked doing it but feel like I cannot anymore in fear of one of these massive flare ups coming back. Thanks for any help. I appreciate it.
140,PSA Vaccinated? Yes you CAN still get shingles: Ha Another nomad Yes I did get the vaccine dose of it. It was about 18 months ago. I am not in Latin America but Florida we are not too far from Latin America. I currently know 2 other people with shingles one with the back pattern just like mine the other one got the face variant.
142,Where to get the shingles vaccine?: Tried to get it a few years ago and was stymied by a combination of insurance and state policies. Tried again more recently and my PCP gave me the vaccine dose and successfully submitted the claim to my medical insurance company with the diagnosis code Crohn's disease of small and large intestines with complication. Good luck to you.
143,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Oh honey. I gasped when I saw your face because it looked just like mine a few years ago. I know how painful it is. I will say I truly think mine was stress related. It sounds like you have a lot going on as well so please take it easy and do not allow yourself to get overwhelmed. I know its hard but you have to find a way. I Am sending good thoughts your way love. Hope it gets better soon.
144,"Shingles confirmed, but doctor said let it go...: 41 yrs old. I had symptoms 2\~3 weeks ago but I have no idea this was Shingles, I did not even imagine such possibility. My symptoms were burning feeling when scratching and muscle pain around the area. It was upper left back muscle near shoulder and left armpit, so I was unable to visibly check, so I thought it is nothing. But my wife told me there are some rashes. Symptom itself is not severe, muscle pain is there but not super painful, it is rather mild. It is itch, but this does not makes me super nervous or does not bothers me. I feel tired than usual though. So I visit doctor and showed him my back, and he said it is Shingles. But since I'm young and symptoms are not severe, so he said I can just let it go. He said since it is already been several weeks, it is too late to use any anti-biotics now. And he said the skin of area is already have crusts, so it seems that there will be no more liquids out so no more worry of contagious. So all he said is rest well and eat well and let it go. No skin cream, no medicine, no nothing. Is this correct? I mean, should I need to listen for second opinion from different doctors?"
145,Shingrix?: In my case I had shingles my first time when I was 22 then 6 more times in the next 10 years. My doctor recommended I get Shin gri x vaccine which I did and have still had shingles 3 more times since getting the vaccine. This is just the life card some of us drew
146,Second Shingles Shot: A friend of mine almost lost her eye because she had shingles on her face. That convinced me not to mess around on that. Neither my husband or I had any symptoms save a sore arm for a day.
148,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My arms are covered in them but they are only noticeable when I Am really cold. My arms turn purple and the scars turn a peachy pink colour.
154,Baby RSV Shot: My baby got his a month ago and he had zero side effects
156,I was working in a hospital when they were doing the jab rollout. I was making sure that I was super healthy but I got shingles. I think I was she would on. Now I do regular doses of Ivermectin.
159,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Did you also have difficulty walking or sitting? I am glad you have recovered already. I also have some numbness on my left butt cheek even though I had no blisters on that area. How did you deal with the itch during the healing stage?
160,Shingles vaccine experience: My wife had shingles and she said it was the worst pain she had ever felt in her life. I did get both shingles vaccinations so far so good
162,Health Update I Lost Everything: Could this be a Covid 19 vaccine injury. A lot of people had bad shingles after this vaccine and other neurological problems like yours. Just in the people that I am subscribe to on Youtube 5 got sick from turbo cancers shingles blood clots and neurological problems. This vaccine seems to turn off your immune system and let us everything run loose. Look up Dr. Peter McCullough or Ryan Cole if you want more deep science on this.
163,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Insurance will not pay for it but your physician may possibly let you get the vaccine if you have recurring shingles. Yes that is a thing of your worst nightmares but I deal with it. I have had the vaccine and am on daily antivirals to prevent.
164,Shingles and other Vaccines: A little soreness at injection site for a day or 2. Is it worth it??? Ummmmm YES ETA have you ever seen someone suffering from a case of shingles? My god. The pain they experience is horrid. Ill take my chances on a vaccine any day.
165,Recent Shingles Diagnosis My story so far...: Did it look like this ? Mine is just very itchy I noticed the rash yesterday
167,I did not have any trouble with my shingles vaccine. Neither one. Sore arm but not any worse than any other vaccine.
169,Naturopathic Clinic?: Hugs to you. Can you tell me what your exact conditions are? Do you get headache and severe fatigue as well? Has it improved over years? Are you able to perform same as before? It actually is somehow similar I guess. Yours was activated by a virus mine by a vaccine triggering my immune system I feel that something in my body is disregulated and if that is found and fixed the system will settle down. Asking for the illness benefit is a good point. Today I discussed it with my manager to understand what entitlement I have. She did not give me an answer and told me that my decision to be at work or not should be based on my fitness to work nothing else  I had been house hunting for the last 67 months no joy yet and I Am mortgage approved. I Am horrified any changes in my healthjob will severely affect the whole thing.
176,It certainly is. We both had the vaccine a few years ago we paid 104 each for it. A very expensive vaccine but worth every penny. My husband had shingles across an eye once was more than enough the extreme pain lasts for many months.
177,I had shingles about 2 months ago on my lower back and it seemed to have fully healed but last week I started having some mild skin sensitivity again in the same area. That was my first symptom about two days before the rash had started. I was worried that the shingles was coming back but since there is still no rash after a week I Am hoping that is unlikely. Do others get skin sensitivity without a rash and what do you do for it?
178,I also got shingles straight after my house mate got vaccinated.
179,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Get the shot I put it off and ended up with ocular shingles. I had no clue you could get it on your facehead and then it spread to my eye. I was out on disability for 9 weeks because my eye became super light and motion sensitive and could not safely drive a car. I am 11 weeks out now and I still have to wear cataract sunglasses and a hat to go outside and have constant nerve pain and weird feelings in my face and scalp. I got the first shingles shot a week ago and I will get the second in October. Totally should have done it 6 years ago when my doc started nagging me about it...
180,vaccine and boosted. Also the RSV. I got my shingles vaccine yesterday. I feel fine . And dandy.
182,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: It was incredibly painful and I got it overseas. It spread really quickly and was a pulsing nerve deep pain. Luckily the painkillers did its work
185,Shingles vaccine: No problem with the vaccine besides a sore arm. The people whom I know who have had shingles say its far worse.
187,Second Shingles Shot: You can get shingles more than once so Id personally recommend the vaccine. Also. You can may not but could experience nerve pain for a while afterward. I got shingles in my 30s. Docs can give you an Rx to get the shot before 50 yrs of age but most wait bc its covered for most by insurance once you hit 50. I am getting my vaccine this year.
190,Yeah. The Shingrix vaccine kicked my ass.
192,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: First one sucked. Second was easy for me"

196,How risky is too risky?: Yes shingles suck I have had them 4 times once since the Shingrix series.
198,"Mom is concerned she didn't get shingles shot?: F53, no preexisting medical history, normal weight. My mother went to a retail pharmacy to receive her second shingles shot (Shingrix). She had significant (though self-limited) side effects with the first vaccine (fever, arm pain for 2-3 weeks, myalgia). When she went for her second shot, her pharmacist was flustered and busy, and had pulled up her shot as well as another patient's, and had both in hand (my mom asked why she had two shots, and the pharmacist said the other vaccine was for her next patient). It's now been 28 hours since she received her vaccine, and she has no side effects other than a sore arm. She is concerned she didn't receive the full Shingrix series, and got someone's flu shot instead. How common would it be to have a weaker systemic response to the second vaccine? Should she consider herself fully protected? Thanks so much for advice and thoughts!"
199,Great as I now have shingles i did get the Shingrex vaccine 2 years ago all those kids who do not get the chicken pox vaccine may suffer this fate too. Its miserable. X2 for them.
200,Shingles vaccine: Me too. I was counting down the days and made the appointment for the day I turned 50. Had very little side effects to both shots just a sore arm.
203,Had a weird rash start developing on Monday that was mostly redness then started getting bumpy Tuesday at first I thought it was a reaction to shaving my legs and today Thursday went to urgent care was told its shingles. Urgent care doctor prescribed antiviral. I had no idea that we were at risk for this simply for being immunocomprimised. I mean I know infections happen easily but I did not even think about this one. I Am a little nervous to see how this goes but hopefully the meds do their job. Talk to your doctor about shingles potentially vaccine ? if you have not already
204,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: No reaction at all. Did Not notice anything different he Got it at 1 month visit
205,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Exactly. I used to work through colds all the time. Then one time I worked 3 days with a bad cold that ended up being pneumonia. Almost died. Lost at least a month of work and 3 months feeling like shit after. That was over 10 yrs ago and I am still not the same. It is not worth screwing your body long term. Now I stay home and rest right away when I do not feel 100
209,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I got vaccinated while I had chicken pox which led to me developing shingles as a 5 or so year old. I shit you not the sunlight burnt my skin and I had big old lumps on my back. The worst
210,I agree with you EXCEPT for the shingles vaccine. I developed shingles but luckily it was caught and treated within 24 hours so the pain was of shorter duration. It is a real vaccinelike polio or small pox and works. PLEASEthe pain is incredible
211,Shingles vaccine experience: My husband had both shots. No side effects at all.
215,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember those I did not go to one but my best friend and I around the same time so there may have been a chicken pox play date or two. Mine was not too bad but my friend got bumps in her throat. It sounded awful.
218,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: Worth mentioning that while the vaccines are amazing and absolutely worth getting you can still get HPV and develop cancer. Practice safe sex and always go to your yearly for a pap smear. In my 20s I caught a weird strain not the usual cancer causing variant of HPV from a long term partner that did not know they were positive. Between my yearly pap smears it progressed rapidly. I was fully vaccinated. It required surgery and post surgical treatment. Its a coin toss whether or not I can have kids now. Its important to not only practice safe sex but insist your partner shows you a negative STD screening before foregoing condoms. We thought we were being safe and I still could have died if not for regular screenings.
221,Had a reaction to shingles vaccine in past. Then they started offering incentives to take it . Did not trust and my discernment kicked in. Thanking God.
222,I Am good. I do not get any vaccinations because each time I do I get sick. Flu shot got the flu. Shingles shot got shingles pneumonia shot got pneumonia. So go F yourself with shots I was given my babyboomer shots and survived to adulthood. Then the vaccine increased and
223,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: My dad is ancient but put most people to shame with brisk 5 mile walks every day. Got shingles 6 months ago and has been in debilitating pain ever since. I reckon its taken 5 years off his life.
225,"Finally out of my flare, loving rinvoq more than I should as it isn't a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: Oh weird. I'm 37 and my GI strongly suggested I get my shingles vaccine as I started Xeljanz back in May. Was also told it's good to have it in case I need to go on Rinvoq. They're pushing it for under 50 here if taking JAK inhibitors."
227,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it. It was not fun but I made out okay. 6 years out no lasting effects. My aunt 60s just had shingles and the pain she is still battling 2 months later is debilitating. No meds are touching it. I Am sorry you are dealing with it.
229,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: When I turned 30 in 2023 my body essentially started breaking down. It was the wildest thing. Literally a week after I turned 30 I had a shingles breakout. My shoulders also basically started falling apart. The shingles thing was the weirdest experience I Have ever had. Just a random wet burning rash on my back that semi healed and now I just have a scar. Thank god I did not get it on my face but holy shit I did not realize a 30 year old man could just get shingles out of nowhere lmao
231,I keep seeing everyone say how severe the pain is with shingles is that the case for everyone? I have a burning feeling where mine is but its like a sun burn so would not say its severe I had this burning for 5 days did not know what it was thought I slept weird or something then the rash appeared on my back shoulder blade Will it get worst than this???
233,Kind of cheaper than having deep losses due to execution problems from low oxytocin.  got a surgery  prescribed some nasty drugs that raises cortisol  tanks oxytocin.  emotionally unstable but damn I was straight grinding BEAMNG drive for 7 days in a row with 12 hours of sleep.  had panik attacks and what not  hit a rough patch with relations  further suppressing oxytocin  kept on travelling to stay emotional stable eg to produce oxytocin.  after I got tired of travelling. Yes I made money but its expensive to travel even if its paid with points or not.  stock market tanks sure I bought the lowest dip of the dip.  at this point I was emotionally numb paired with accutane and other medications  extra bozo  I usually cash out 23 days into the month  forced rollover.  travelled to Toronto with relatives. Same story for cash out  forced rollover. Rollover is define as savings or whatever funds you have pay now  use your investments to pay you back later. This will fail if you are bad at management or make no profit or a loss from investments.  increased dose of Lecithin to 9.6g from 4.8g because weakness in my limbs due to development issues from shingles likely. Which increases ACh  Did Not know high doses will suppress Oxytocin  took another month eg September of no profit eg had to pay my final secured loans  cash out 3 months from investments to repay all the rollovers.  October rolled over. my mind thought that let me fuck around in the stock market aka short and deviate from my money maker strategies  min 20 ROI monthly  because I paid off all my loans and VIX was above 20 and models was posting to get out I experienced a 20 loss in NAV across all accounts while I should have made 30 NAV in October. However I still have unsecured loans eg LOC due to dip buying from August. Which means during this whole time. I was emotionally unstable due to low oxytocin.  November when I was on the bed after waking up and a thought came in let me see if there a lagotto on sale locally instead flying to Italy in January to import one.  bam we got a lagotto. This included an hour of arguing then decided to drive 1 hours to purchase it and 3 hours back while getting all the doggo supplies. I had nothing not even a leash. The doggo followed me that is why I bought her.  now it is end of November. My execution is MWUAH and I feel like the old me. Productive and have a purpose in life because I feel like a father to the doggo including vaccinations microchip best quality kibble and pet insurance. Dog training is so stressful but at the end of the day I do not lose almost 5 figs a month from bad execution or deviating from working strategies. I make rapid decisions now eg within mins and it does not take me 2 weeks to decide. Which means that its oxytocin and low cortisol with acute stress from vasopressin. Since Ill still engage with junk fooddesirescravings but its reduced by 90  Now it makes sense why most traders must have a pet or children because it prevents overthinkingemotional instability and let them have a purpose in life because being a middleman is boring  excessive mental energy esp if not interacting with customers or sellers. Since I was previously like what now? After backtesting for 4 years straight with 1 year of complete snowball. afterwards I can backtest and snowball within a day  felt no purpose During the short fails I made counter strategies that went short to see false positives and vice versa within one model.  in hindsight I should have realized that the models that predicts the market does not work during US presidential election month. Which is why my short failed After mid August I was constantly sick 23 weeks of sickness from a cold or whatnot  2 weeks no sickness  repeat  further suppressing serotonin and oxytocin.
236,Grateful that I got the vaccine too but unfortunately not till I had a bout of shingles 4 years ago. It truly is a nasty disease. Left me with permanent nerve damage in one leg. Did not get antivirals in time it triggered glaucoma in both eyes. Lucky not to have been blinded.
239,Male 36 170lbs. HBP. Telemesartan 40mgday Finsteride 1mgday Hair Loss. Noticed abnormality this morning diagnosed as Shingles in the evening. This morning I noticed bumps on my neck that were certainly not there yesterday and do not hurt itch or tingle that I assumed were bug bites. I was born with HSV1 so I typically know the sensation of herpes outbreaks. Anyway by evening I discovered multiple bumps and a rash in the mirror. Concerned I went to urgent care was seen almost immediately was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed Valacyclovir for a week. I initially suspected an allergic reaction to a 1g dose of Azithromycin taken two days earlier for nonspecific dysuria but the doctor ruled it out and repeated it was shingles. I mentioned the lack of pain but the doctor said it was caught early. Here Is a picture I trust the diagnosis but am uncertain due to the absence of pain. Does this seem consistent with shingles some bumps I pointed out do look fluid filled? Additionally am I in for a world of hurt in the coming days or will the early treatment likely prevent that? TIA.
243,Shingles: I took it and like another person in this post I was having a flare up every year but since I Have been on Mounjaro I Have had it one time and not again. Mounjaro has also drastically improved my auto immune disease. I have PSA and within 6 weeks of starting Mounjaro my psoriasis and most joint pain went away and has not come back. That Is not coincidental
245,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: The flu wore me down to a nub this year. Shingles would kill me do not skip yer shots everyone.
247,I had no reaction to the shingles vaccine. But I also had the original vaccine and I think I already had some immunity.
248,Shingles vaccine second dose: I did not have any reaction to either dose. Felt normal after both
253,should I feel nausea after the 2nd injection same dose?: I was told to try giving the shots in my thighs to cut down on nausea. It worked for me so I alternate between my thighs each shot day.
254,I am doing better. The Shingles shot is what is slowing me down but that should run its course soon. Meanwhile having Rachel back is so comforting. I got her a new lamb because her other one was worn. She brought it into the bed last night.
255,Shingles vaccine experience: Apart from a slightly sore arm no reaction. It was smooth like but tah.
257,Shingles Sucks: I had it in my late 30s and I felt like I had been used as a punching bag. When I first went to the Doc they did not think it was shingles since it was over my whole torso area. I would not want it later in life.
258,WHAT TO DO WHEN SHINGLES STRIKE: Yeah but I was plenty po'd  everyone else in the waiting area EXCEPT me got a shot of something in their IV  a couple of them were a little loopy before they were wheeled out. They did not give me anything until I was in the procedure room with my bare butt in the air and it never kicked in. I felt every bit of the procedure and all the doctor did was reassure me that labor epidurals used a much larger needle. It was a lot of paindiscomfort to only relieve one third of my pain. The goal was for me to be able to get off the gabapentin but my intake has not decreased at all.
264,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in the late 80s and I had chicken pox when I was 7yo or so? I became a nurse so I had to get a varicella titer to see if I still had immunity and boy did I My daughter received the vaccine and while she never developed chicken pox she did have shingles at 4yo. The doctor would not have thought it was shingles at her age except his son 5yo had just been diagnosed with shingles two weeks prior. She also did not seem like it was bothering her but because she had developed the lesion on her lower arm I knew she had to see a doctor. It never became severe and I am so thankful for that.
268,Hey all finally officially dx seronegative RA about 5 weeks ago after 3 mth trial of DMARDs. Rheumy increased methotrexate to 20mg week. Basically have felt like death since generally unwell swollen glands fluey like. Broke out in a rash a week ago and dx with shingles Has anyone else had shingles since starting or increasing methotrexate? Its nasty
271,Do I have scabies?: I think pain is relative overall because I had no idea that my shingles was shingles. It was uncomfortable and itchy but given my other types of ongoing pain I did not consider it to be painful and has scratched some of the blisters. Mine travels the nerve pathways towards my ear so they had to watch it for awhile but I always say now. Pain? I would not describe it as pain as much as uncomfortable
274,My 30yearold daughter had it. Based on her experience she thinks anyone that refuses vaccination is complete idiot. She would not wish shingles on anyone.
276,41 and got Shingles: I got mime at 30 and my GF just got hers at 31
277,Shingles and other Vaccines: Several people warned me that the second shingles vaccine was bad so I scheduled it on a Friday and took the day off which was a good thing because they were right. I Have known two women who almost lost an eye from shingles one could not work for 2 months because she had to stay in a dark room to rest her eyes and then had to wear sunglasses inside for months. I also knew a person who developed horrific persistent pain afterwards and it ruined his life. I also feel yucky for a day or two after my Covid vaccines but I Am fine with that too. Your reaction to some vaccines is a real side effect so just plan on taking it easy after vaccines. I think I Have read that it may be a sign of a robust immune system which is great.
279,First shingles vaccine side effects: Yes. Mine was milder than my husband. He was out for a week from work. Slept all day and complained of body aches. After what I saw my boss go through with shingles I figured it was worth it. Her side body looked like someone sliced her open with a red hot sword. I am not exaggerating. So awful. Hope you feel better very soon Take it easy.
281,My dad had shingles. It really sucked he was in pain and it was TOTALLY preventable. Get your vaccine once you get shingles you have it forever.
283,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Literally not true. I walked into CVS at 28 and got it done.
285,Shingles second shot update.: I got adult chickenpox I Am here to say it was the absolute worst. Just beyond anything I Have ever experienced. I just turned 50 I Am gearing up to get the shingles vaccine because heck no do I want to go through anything like that ever again.
291,Hang on The FDA Knew This About Pzifer and Didn39t Tell Us? Redacted w Natali Clayton Morris: Did not pregnant nurses during the Covid circus have huge numbers of adverse gestational anomalies after Covid vaccines?
292,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox as a kid as it made its way through school. Did Not have a particularly bad case. I got shingles the day after my 40th birthday. Definitely made me feel my age. That coupled with planters fasciitis a week later and I honestly thought I was falling apart.
293,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: The first time I had shingles the DR wrote me off for two weeks which seemed like a lot at the time  but after two weeks off I almost passed out driving home from my first day back at work. Shingles can because terrible exhaustion which in my case led to post viral fatigue for about two years that my doctor only acknowledged after long covid became so common. I say off but my husband was away for two months and I had an infant and a preschooler so I do not believe I got the rest my body truly needed. Now any time I know of adults getting chicken pox chicken pox is not endemic where I liveor shingles I tell them to get antivirals if they can and REST for a week longer than they think they need to. Valcyclivor does give me symptoms too though... but it is still better than shingles
294,ON RSV Vaccine location: My baby got it at birth and she was born October 30th 
299,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Karma bit MIL in the ass Shingles are very painful
300,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I have never had shingles but I just got through a bout of cellulitis and if I ever have pain like that again I would rather just die. Getting the shingles vac as soon as this completely clears up.
303,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was told by a doctor recently that you can get the shingles vaccine before you are 50 if you have had shingles. I got shingles in college and I Am 40something now. I did not get the shingles vaccine that day as I had just gotten my flu and covid shots.
306,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had a mild case of shingles two years ago also affected my inner thigh. I Have not yet received the vaccine but this thread has me convinced to do so.
308,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had it. It sucked. Cannot agree more
311,1000. It is better than Shingles but it is not take the shot and go about your day. It is a get the vaccine on A Friday and commit to bed shot. Heads up number 2 is worse.
315,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I also recieved it as well as my son. We still got it but he was just congested and runny nose never needed any treatment or hospitalization I got it way worse
316,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: My aunt was in a coma for several months with meningitis that was believed to be caused by shingles. She suffered brain damage and is now permanently disabled. She was not vaccinated for shingles but she would have been in her early 60's I believe when this happened here in Ontario I believe she was just below the age at which the vaccine is recommended which is why she did not have it yet. My dad had singles when I was a kid some time in his 40's. he is now 77 and still talks about how miserable it was and yes he is now been vaccinated for it
318,41 and got Shingles: I had them and same thing. Diagnosis early helps along with oatmeal soap for itching. I have no autoimmune or other chronic issues. Just stress induced. It sucked ... give it weeks for itching and burning to stop. I still have marks a year later.
322,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Shingles can have a devasting effect. My husband worked with a man who got shingles over a large portion of his body and the pain was unbearable. The man was put on all sorts of drugs for shingles side effects and for pain. The pain can last long after the lesions heal becoming a severe chronic pain. He struggled for a long time and eventually had to even stop working. It was very bad. It is the situation that convinced me to get vaccinated.
324,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Had shingles twice in the last 2 years and it was the worst pain of my fucking life
325,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was 14 when I finally caught the chickenpox horrible experience. Thought it was acne at 1st so 2 really unfortunate things happened I absolutely destroyed my skin and I caused a mini outbreak in my highschool.
326,Shingles vaccine: I watched my mother deal with shingles that became Bell's Palsy. She had to tape her eye shut for a year because it would not close. I got the vaccine series as soon as I was allowed to. Got a slightly sore arm nothing more. Always always get the vaccine
328,MILs work has a RSV outbreak do we still go for Christmas ?: Not sure if it is an option for you but my newborn just got vaccinated for RSV and they said they do the vaccine for up to 18mos
329,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Had them not too bad. Had Kidney Stones oow. Some other not so nice things to look forward to. Back pain sciatica from a budging disc. Hip pain from Osteoarthritis. Gout both feet elbow and shoulder fuck me.
334,Good for you sir I am in my 13th week of SHINGLEShealing The healing has been worse than the actual active part My ear The damage done Get your SHINGLES SHOT. It is way more PAINFUL than you can ever know Believe me. It is still painful today 13 weeks LATER Get vaccine
335,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: I did not get the jab but I got the OG Covid and I was hospitalized for almost a month. It is been almost 3 years and sometimes I just cannot breathe out of the blue. I wear an oxygen concetrator while I sleep and that helps minimize how often it happens.
336,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: The Shingles vaccine is a painful bitch.
338,My baby will be 2.5 months and I am planning to host a christmas dinner at our home. We will have some outside area available for guests as well as inside and plan to make an early start and ventilate properly. Cannot help but doubt if its such a bad idea to bring friends over with a newborn in the house? He will be vaccinated 2 weeks prior with all the necessary newborn vaccines and has already done the RSV. What would you do? I really would like to host this event for our family and for friends to meet our son and celebrate this occasion but doubting if I am making the right decision bringing around 20 people over.
340,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I have really bad reactions to the Covid shots too and was all prepared for the shingles shots to do the same thing and all I got was the sore arm and maybe a little rundown (like after a flu shot) so I am super scared for shot number two because it seems like if one isn't bad, the second is. I take them on the Friday morning of the three day weekend."
343,Both at the same time felt fine no problems here but also I have not ever had a noticeable reaction to anything other than the shingles vaccine which always makes me lie down about 36 hours after I have had it. So it will be mild and chill and very good for you A stranger says so
344,RSV vaccine?: I Am due in May and still got it. No side effects for me barely even a sore arm Definitely worth it
345,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: I just had a hysterectomy a few weeks ago so I have got a few pain meds I can take when it gets bad. The doctor prescribed steroids along with the valacyclovir and told me to increase the gabapentin I am already taking from the last round of shingles. Yesterday I had six bumps today I have two red dots and one bump. So maybe the vaccine is helping and also maybe starting meds within a couple hours of the bumps showing up.
347,Shingles vaccine experience: I did not realize until afterwards that death is a fairy rare However the risk of both getting shingles and the risk of hospitalization or death increases with age as well as for those with compromised immunities. Almost all of us felt sick following the shingles vaccinations but it is a far easier recovery than actually coming down with the virus.
348,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: It is got exactly the same side effect profile as every vaccination. Mainly soreness at the site of injection and flulike symptoms. Most people sometimes get one the other both or both  an array of other effects like headache. Covid flu shingles they are all the same. A day or three of discomfort for sometimes years of protection. And sometimes you get lucky and do not have any side effects at all
349,Some good news. . .cervical cancer rates fall: This is great. Had an abnormal pap when I was in college despite being vaccinated but it has since become less of a concern so other strains do still manifest but not like the way they would without the vaccine. Fun tidbit from my OBGyn is that most people have a type of HPV if they have been sexually active doctors do not even test for it with a regular STD panel. You only find out its there if you have an abnormal test.
350,My mother and grandmother got shingles and both said the pain was excruciating and it took a while to clear. I have witnessed first hand how much they suffered. I am fully vaccinated against Shingles Please listen to the good Dr and make your appointment AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
351,No it does not. My neighbors got those shots and Both of them got shingles. She got them around her eye and they moved onto her scalp. Hit nerves and almost killed her. Horiffic experience for her. Was hospitalized for 6 days.
354,Shingles vaccine: The drug was absolutely wonderful I had no noticeable side effects whatsoever. I only had to stop it because it eventually elevated my ALT. I really hope it works well for you and that the shingles vaccine goes smoothly.
356,Shingles Vaccine: Me too. 100. Shingles was the worst pain of my life and it lasted over a month for me. I had itching in the area for another two years. I Have had four babies one of them with very little pain meds. Shingles was worse and lasted much longer. My neighbor said his shingles was worse than his kidney stones. I believe him.
358,Essential T cells: Work colleague got bad shingles after clot shot.... Refused to believe it was anything to do with the stab
360,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Weird my husband got shingles when we were on vacation a patch on his torso and after resting one day was fine. He called the pains you describe shooters and said they were mildly uncomfortable but was up and around after a day. I guess he was just lucky.
361,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My 25weeker qualified for it during her first year only. They gave it to her as she was leaving the NICU I want to say a few days prior? in order to maximize effectiveness they figured the chances of an infection during her stay were very low but they would of course go way up once she was discharged so they delayed it as much as possible. No side effects and no RSV as far as we know.
362,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am a victim of the chickenpox party too I also had shingles at 23 It was excruciating. Dr was like how tf do you have shingles at 23? I Do Not Know maybe because I felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders already at 23. I digress lol. Anyway I Have only had shingles that one time 15 years ago and I pray I never get it again. I hope you feel better soon
363,This happened a couple years ago but I thought this might stir interesting conversation When I went down the rabbit hole that is remote viewing Ingo Swann project Stargate Hal Putoff etc. I started to try my hand at the craft. I was having solid results in the general sense so I doubled down. I started coupling RVing with deep meditation before and after sessions I listened to bioneural beats in sound cancelling headphone in a dark room trying to silence the noise in my head to be as blank as possible to precieve targets. After about a week of doing this religiously I felt a sensitive spot on the top of my head that ultimately turn out to be a reemergence of the shingles virus If you know anything about shingles its the chicken pox virus that lives dormant in your body once you have had chicken pox that can wake up at anytime throughout your life. The virus operates a Neurological level not the environmental level. interesting fact Depending on which nerves in your brain it impacts it will only present on the left or right side of your body. It is commonly said stress or a weakened immune system can because it to wake up. I know correlation does not mean causation but I could not help but notice the proximity of remote viewing training and my shingles outbreakthat dark energy occultist shit. Ultimately I stopped RVing for awhile after that but still do it from time to time for the novelty of it. Id love to hear this communitys take.
364,The shingles vaccine sucks.: My Mom had it was Awful
365,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it as a young child and had a friend who got it in her teens and it seemed a lot worse for her.
366,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had 3 sores total and they only lasted as long as mosquito bites. Still got shingles on my back later.
371,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: She fell SO HARD. Like genuinely if this had turned out to be fatal that would not have surprised me. Luckily she is okay and claims to have no lingering symptoms. I hope that is true because she certainly got a bad TBI from this fall. I would like to hear from her close family and friends to see if there is any issues or changes she is not noticing herself.
375,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I got shingles on the left side of my head and face at 33 in 2018. It was 5 years before my UC diagnosis but yeah it definitely sucked. I have scaring on my face just above my eyebrow from it. Fortunately it did not make is way into my eye but I looked like a zombie meth head for a few weeks.
377,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Getting Shingles July Aug of 22 I was 44 was one the worst experiences I ever had it lasted over a month. All the muscles impacted which are my left flank to front ribs still have nerve pain and will flair up for various reasons. Shingles is no joke good job getting the vaccine As I write this I can feel it.
378,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Early early 90s and I caught it from other kids. They did not have the vaccine either invented or available yet. My first case was mild so I got it a second time and the second time was ROUGH. My titer results prove it. We are vaccinating our kids against it though. I do not want them to get shingles.
379,Shingrix: Two of my family members got it. They both got shingles a week after. One case went away after a month the other had shingles for 5 years until she died she was very old.
381,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was vaccinated still got chickenpocks as a toddler and then somehow got them again at about 16. Doctors said it was so rare for anyone older than 56 to get it now days that the hospitals had no modern images or case studies to do research on. The doctor asked if he could take photos of my case so other doctors could reference and learn from it they did and made some infographic style wall posters hospitals display about adultteen chickenpocks that my body is pictured in. Adultteen chickenpocks is much worse than when you are a child. Had to stay home from school for about a month or two my sophomore year in high school had the sickness itself for a few weeks and then it took another few weeks or so for the blisters to heal enough for me to be able to go outside or do anything normal. I just stayed inside and played World of Warcraft all day and then did what homework I could over the weekends. Now I am scared that I am more susceptible to shingles and that a 3rd encounter with chickenpocks will be really bad because it gets worse each time.
386,I am a 5 9' 145 lb year old male. I am in decent physical shape and fairly active. Outside of IBS flareups have never experienced any 'significant' health issues until recently. Have had annual physicals for the past 10 years  and the only thing addressed in past years is cholesterol triglycerides levels which have improved and my Homocysteine level which ranges between 19 and 25. My issues On and off IBS attacks Eyes feel dry and gritty with puffy eye lids skin feels dry and a bit rashitchy on upper chest fatigued toward end of day gout joints in hands and toes feel tight thirsty but not dry mouth and blood work My IBS attacks are quite severe and the pattern is always the same. After a couple of days of slight constipation I wake up in the middle of the night and begin cramping until the cycle completes with diarrhea. The cramps are intense and usually go on for 12 hours until everything releases. I am completely wiped out for days after these attacks but kind of used to them. Thankfully I can go weeks to months without them which I am sure in part are triggered by stress. About 1.5 years ago I started feeling off and noticed whenever sick i.e. colds Covid Flu etc the effects were far worse than in past years and seemed to trigger other medical conditions. Soon after the flu I had a really bad case of shingles and then developed gout. I am now taking 200mg Allopurinol and Colchicine which has helped keep the gout in check. Fast forward to late summer 2024  Started feeling off again. Blood work showed a slightly elevated TSH and my Calcium is 10.4. but my docs GI and Rheum were not overly concerned. Then in Sept I went downhill and found myself in the ER with an acute Diverticulitis attack and was prescribed Cipro and Flagyl which seemed to knock it out. Then about 2 weeks later started feeling sick again and was diagnosed with CDifferent. Went on 10 days of Vancomycin which helped. Fast forward another 2 months and I have had numerous blood tests and am ANA Negative Sjogrens Negative Smooth Muscle Negative. However my AST and ALT are in the 50's and 80's respectively over several retests my RF is 19 Calcium is elevated and they ran an Iron panel and my Ferritin Saturation is high in the 50's. other iron levels within range I am nervous this is autoimmune or something liver related like Hemochromatosis and the advice received today was let us wait a month or so and then retest. Thanks for allowing me to post and apologize for
391,Common reaction to the shingles vaccine is severe soreness around the injection site deep into the muscle. Lasts that day that night and into the next morning. Can be sharp pain but is usually a dull throbbing.
392,oh no. shingles shot really hurts. did shingles in 1 arm tetanus in the other once. was miserable with ice packs on both arms. one shot at a time from then on. Stay strong hope your experience was better than mine.
399,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles when I was 37. It was no party. Pain reverberated through my body with each step. I sure as hell would not want it now.
402,Shingles shot: Yep. No internal physical effects of the shot just external as you said felt like someone punched me in the arm and it did not stop me either.
405,My baby just got the RSV shot Why are more vaccines not just antibodies like this one? Explain to me like I Am 5: Thank you I think that is what he got Beyfortus
406,"Stroke risk from Shingles: Just wondering if anyone has read the medical literature about having an increased risk of heart attack and stroke for at least a year after having shingles. I'm angry that the doctor did not mention this to me. Also, what can be done to prevent this from happening? I started taking aspirin 81mg as a preventative for stroke. As if having Shingles isn't traumatic enough now I have to worry about stroking out at 46 yr old."
408,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles about a year and a half ago at 41. Got chickenpox when I was around 8 I think. I Am chalking that one up to being stress induced. At first I thought I had somehow strained something on the right side of my torso. I waited a couple days the pain was not going away and then I noticed some red splotches on my skin roughly where the pain was. I decided to do some research about what it could be and it was all pointing to shingles. I went in to urgent care the next day to confirm the diagnosis and get the antiviral meds. It wasan experience. I Have never wanted to claw my own skin off until I got shingles. I do not think I got a whole lot of sleep while my skin was looking and feeling like I was sprouting fish eggs I was out for a week. It was especially tough to have a toddler want to use you as their jungle gym and not understand what was wrong which was quite sad. The spots on my skin where the rashes were stayed visible for months. I think they are pretty much gone by now though. Ill be getting my vaccine as soon as I Am eligible and not a moment too soon. That was not what I call good time.
410,Getting two vaccines at once: Shingles vaccine can be rough. I was down for two days and then fine. Family members had shingles before the vaccine and they had horrible experiences. I was so happy to get the vaccine. The tetanus one gave me a sore arm.
412,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Got my first case of shingles in middle school entire side of my back cannot remember which side and again in my early 20s small spot on my inner right arm. The doctor said they will not give me the shingles vaccine until I am in my 50s because when you get the vaccine there is a chance it can because an outbreak of shingles. I luckily have not had it again yet but I am just waiting and hope it is in a manageable spot again.
414,Rash on back: Hi Rash that appeared on back couple of days ago could be an allergic reaction or something else? There's two different spots of it one larger and one small! Thanks
416,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I had shingles when I was 30 years old. It was on the back of my head and hurt like a MF
419,Husband got shingles days after a Covid booster. His mom got shingles also days following a Covid booster and she also had a shingles vaccine a few month prior. Her case of shingles was bad. A lot depends on the person.
420,I was taken to the hospital for confusion and extreme head pain I have Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and Shingles in Face and Ear. I got a lumbar puncture to check for encephalitis thank god I do not have it. My dr who discharged me after 24 hours told me she is seeing more and more young people with slShingles and quite severe cases like mine and she speculated it has to do with COVID infections. I had COVID in October for the 2nd time and then got Shingles November 15th. Does anyone know of any studies on this?
423,Please get your chickenpox or shingles vaccine. Whichever comes first. Nurses and doctor were in a we at how bad I caught shingles and additionally I am at a more younger group of people who have had it in their records so this was concerning to them. It affects my inner right ear my cheeks down to my jaw tongue and teeth region. This is not a joke. The aftermath is terrible. I am probably I have a followup over the virus itself I have got no blisters but there are pain flare ups that feel like someone lit the sun under my skin. To add on to it I am still learning what triggers them so far regular emotions do. Whenever I feel myself getting happy and relaxed I suddenly get a flare up. I am on gaba pent in and a cream for the itch in the meantime but they wear off quickly and do not remove the pain. I have developed tin n it us from this and it is 247 pain even on meds. I look like Two face from Batman now as well. This is not a pity post though more just stressing to get the vaccine if possible. Outside of this my life is great. I have a wonderful girlfriend great job nice cozy apartment I work out regularly and even have family who loves me. Even my girlfriend's grandfather wants to take me golfing and considers me his grandson. Shingles is just added an unwanted zest to life that I hope you can prevent from invading your life. It is more painful that the name shingles implies. Shingles sounds like something someone from 1923 would write in their journal about acquiring. It does not sound menacing but indeed it is troublesome. Edit Although I cannot reply to every post here thank you for sharing your knowledge on this and taking it seriously. I am officially shingles free from this flare up for now. Doctors now have me on 600 mg 3 x of Gaba pent in 1 50 mg tab of an oral steroid Oxys Tylenol combined RIP liver enzyme levels and Ibuprofen in between to stabilize me and I use Terra sill for the incessant itching. Everybody please take life a bit easier and do not let stress take you over.
431,More evidence of a failing immune system: My wife got shingles in about the same time frame after getting her vaccine I did not get the poke and have no shingles.
432,Shingles: I just got over shingles last month. It was on my face Horrible. I cannot imagine how much pain it would be on my back. But I Am really old and have had the vaccine so that might be why I had a mild case.
433,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Here is to hoping I wake up in the morning feeling better
434,Long covid shingles I Am just so done with this: No nerve pain sounds promising I hope it stays that way for you. Mine was immediate and severe and did not stop. I think covid made it so much worse. Its definitely hard to recognize shingles if you have not had it before. Sometimes it can be a small pimple like dot to begin with. I hope you recover quickly Now you know and have the antiviral prescription so you are in a good position moving forward.
436,"Severe reaction to Pfizer vaccine: I received my first dose last week and I've been experiencing intense side effects ever since. I've had a high fever and body aches, making it difficult to even get out of bed. To top it off, my arm where I got the injection is incredibly swollen, red, and hot to the touch. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to the Pfizer vaccine? This is really taking a toll on me."
440,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Now this is a worthwhile post my mom suffered terribly. I got mine as soon as eligible at CVS so glad I did reading these stories they are worse than what my mom experienced
444,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: My parents purposely exposed my brother and I to chickenpox as young children sent us to our babysitter's whose children already had it. Can confirm that was normal for the time esp in my rural area. The vaccine came out like 2 years later. Still have those memories of the incredible pain. Being 5 years old in the bathtub sores all over my body sitting in an oatmeal bath. It was like pins and needles on my skin. This post has made me think that perhaps I should try to get a vaccine. My 20s and 30s were filled with times of incredible duress and I am wondering if shingles rashes emerged and I ignored it thinking it was something else.
446,Shingles vaccine experience: Vaccines have side effects but generally none are as bad as the disease they protect against. There is so much contention and resistance to vaccines that I Am left shaking my head at the willful ignorance of people. Do they not realize that diseases once common like polio smallpox measles etc which had some pretty devastating consequences had been more or less eradicated in most countries due to vaccines? I got my shingles vaccine COVID vaccines and flu shot with no more than a sore arm. Well worth a couple days of minor discomfort to help protect against much worse potential consequences.
451,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: probably because of the vaccine I did not have a mild case of chicken pox it was extremely itchy and unpleasant for way too long. Obviously there are way worse things to happen to a kid than to be itchy and uncomfortable for a while but I definitely would have liked to avoid it lol. Luckily my kids got their shots and either will not get it or will have a very mild case like you. Fingers crossed anyway.
456,"Turned the big 5-0 today and I have questions: Jet pack? What are you, 90? That's a boomer thing and you know it. We have had flying cars for decades. They are called helicopters. You need special licenses and training to use them. As you know, anything that fly's should. And they also have hoverboards. They only work in a vacuum and at almost absolute zero fahrenheit. I also turn 50 this year. So I am also firmly in my ""fuck you, you fucking fuck"" phase of my life."
457,My son was vaccinated for chicken pox never got chicken pox but did get shingles when he was 10. The scars on his back are still visible 10 years later.
459,Mom ruined my life by not letting me get the hpv vaccine: It is a bit more painful than your average vaccine but the soreness goes away quickly its not a big deal. Just got my 3rd
460,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Nope had both doses a year ago. No adverse reactions to either dose.
461,Update on my previous post: Holy moly. This is literally exactly what happened to my mom and I have never found any similar stories until now. Like your wife after my mom did radiation she also got shingles. She was put on immunotherapy shortly after she recovered from shingles because the cancer has spread and then she got diagnosed with guillan barre syndrome. The neurologist said he thought the immunotherapy caused GBS but it was impossible to tell. The GBS made her unable to walk for a year or so but after about a year she was doing really well and getting better. Then she got sepsis very quickly and passed. The entire thing was extremely traumatic so I feel your pain and I Am so sorry for what you all went through. But it sounds like you were an amazing caregiver and advocate for your wife and I know she felt that in her final days.
469,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yes. I got the vaccine after getting shingles. I hope it prevents a future outbreak.
471,Shingrix experiences?: I am usually sick in bed for 2 days after flu or covid shots but shingrix was fine for me.
476,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: So you had the vaccine but got shingles anyway? Or you got vaccine after having had shingles? Absolutely everything I Have heard about shingles is bad. Do not want.
477,Same here but it was the 2nd shingles shot. Took about 8 hours to hit me. Lasted about 10 hours.
480,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: That was me at 41. No MRNA vaccine ever. Shingles and the related pain have totally redefined my pain scale. Writhing in bed at night. I Am still recovering from late March diagnosis.
481,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I did that LOL I had Trex arms for two days
482,Do you experience flare up after vaccines?: I have never had a flare after receiving a vaccine even the Shingrix which I thought would lay me out. Even COVID itself did not bring on a flare. I feel very lucky in this regard. The last flare I had in June was a doozy and I will avoid that at all costs.
483,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had a rough time with the first dose. The second was so much better. Last year's COVID booster kicked my ass. 103 fever that caused shivering, teeth chattering violently, and my arm visibly shaking uncontrollably. The arm lasted 45 minutes. Fever was 2 days. Oh the joys of getting old."
484,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Oof I have had shingles twice within two years.
485,Just got diagnosed with shingles this morning 46m. Let me start by telling you something about myself. I work hard supervising a mediocre pizza restaurant in California. I have rheumatoid issues and joint problems and never seem to get ahead in life so I tend to avoid seeking medical attention if I can help it. This was different. Today was day four of symptoms. First day I started feeling tender on my left forearm left flank left armpitupper back and left side of my groin. It felt like a minor sunburn. Next day it moved from my forearm to my upper arm. Groin and flank feeling went away. Then I developed a rash of blistery eruptions across my left chest armpit and upper back. I felt a weird soreness across and seemingly through my chest. This is when I started doing my research online. I decided that this was no ordinary skin irritation so better safe than sorry. I was able to schedule and appointment with a physician yesterday for this morning and I was diagnosed immediately. My grandmother was miserable with shingles for months once so yeah I Am glad I paid the 65 copay and got this figured out. Doctor prescribed 7 days worth of 1000mg valacyclovir valtrex to be taken about once every eight hours. I honestly was not going to join this sub but reading through this last night made me suspect the worst and was very helpful. Therefore I would like to contribute what I can to help others in any way I can in dealing with this. Ill be an expert of sorts on the matter soon enough I suppose. Now I just hope Ill still be able to work otherwise Ill be kicked out of my apartment and lose everything I Have spent the last 20 years working for. Best of luck to all of you and wish me luck too
488,"Post-vaccine reaction: After receiving the Covid vaccine, I experienced a severe shingles case that affected two dermatomes (L1 and L2). This was 3 months post-vaccine and 6 weeks post-partum. Recently, whenever I get sick with ""flu-like"" symptoms, I noticed that the pain concentrates in the same joints on the left side - specifically the SI joint and hip. Unfortunately, I contracted Covid in the past two weeks, and the nerve and joint pain I'm experiencing is exactly in the same spots as my shingles outbreak. This has been the most troubling symptom for me. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? I've started taking lysine as a precaution. Stay safe and healthy, everyone! ?????? ---"
495,That shingles shot did not have me looking glamorous.
496,RSV vaccine preterm labor risk?: I got it. Felt fine. Saved my baby for almost a year. She just got RSV at 11 months January 1st and let me tell you I would not wish this on my worst enemy. She is still sick and it is now the 15th I have not had a full night sleep since the first. Edit to add i think it protects for the first 6 months. Which is VITAL And the only reason my infant got it was because she drank out of her nephews sippy cup who had it mom did not tell us until after it happened. I also took my eyes away for a moment and did not see the cup until it was too late
498,I had this after a Tetanus shot that is why I am afraid of a Shingles shot. I do need to re up my Tetanus shot.
500,I would say that Naomi deserves a good case of shingles to broaden her knowledge base. When she gets that active case I highly reccommend she avoid all those silly big pharma shill things like Valtrex and gabapentin. Ride it out naomi..... For me heck ya I got shingles vaccine
501,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Got shingles on my face in 2023. WORST PAIN EVER Everyone I know who is eligible has gotten the vaccine after seeing what I looked like.
507,Vaccination in UK: I just had all the vaccines whooping coughRSVCovidflu and no side effects at all not even a sore arm in my case. But I mean even if you get the latter or feel tired for a day it does not compare to risking your babys life.
508,Hi I am 24 F and I have had MS for a little over a year and a half according to how far back my first symptoms started. I had to go to the ER in November for a sudden sixth nerve palsy that resulted in blurry and double vision. After some MRI scans and a spinal tap there I was told I have MS. They referred me to a neurologist who I have seen a few days ago. He confirmed an MS diagnosis relapsing remitting and wants me to get on Oc rev us. I agreed despite my concerns with PML and breast cancer risks really regretting that and he wanted to get some lab work done beforehand. I got some blood work done before I left and one of the results showed up in my My Chart. But I m highly confused and don t understand it or what it means for me. This is my result VARICELLA ZOSTER IGG ANTIBODY Study Result Narrative Reference Range Negative or 0 80 A I Equivocal 0 9 1 0 A I Positive or 1 A I A negative result indicates no current or previous infection with V Z V. Such individuals are presumed to be susceptible to primary infection. A positive test result indicates a past infection with V Z V or vaccination and indicates immunity to V Z V. The numeric final result does not indicate the amount of anti V Z V antibody present. Component Results Your Value 0 2 A I Can someone please tell me whether I am positive or negative? I don t understand these numbers but I m assuming I m negative? Does this result mean I can no longer consider Oc rev us as a treatment option? I am really confused because I did receive chickenpox vaccines when I was very young. So if I m reading this right shouldn t I be positive instead of negative? Am I still able to take Oc rev us despite this result? That is my main worry right now. The neurologist I seen was acting as if I am for sure going to be able to get on Oc rev us even before collecting and viewing my blood work results. Can this result change that? I would really appreciate any help here. Thank you.
509,I no longer trust the pharm industry. Besides I know people that got the shot and still got shingles.
510,Hi all I am sorry if this question has been asked but i have gotten shingles in my 3rd trimester here I am at 32 weeks and I am having unbearable pain I spent a good 5 days crying ever since the.the blister formed and now it is all over the right side of my scalp... well yesterday the pain was too much the doctor gave me two IV doses of dilaudid and now about 4 days worth of Oxy to help with the pain.. I feel like a terrible person doing this but my stress is through the roof I was not sleeping... ans the Oxy does not work as good as the IV meds but am I doing the right thing? He gave them to me so the antiviral has time to work because I have taken 20 of those in two days so far 24 counting today. I do not know when the antiviral will help it I do not know when the pain will subside... I am so scared of harming the baby and they told me it is safe but what constitutes as safe? Am I going to get withdrawal within the 4 days even if taken as directed? It is 14 pills. Will that harm the baby? I will probably ask my midwife as well but I wanted to see if anyone here has gone through the same troubles... he is been moving just fine and seems perfectly happy but god damn if I do not feel like a bad mom already.
513,41 and got Shingles: I got it at 31 When symptoms first started I did not even consider that it could be shingles. It started with an itch with no rash or anything. Then the pain started and I thought maybe I had overdone it at the gym. When the blisters started that was when I knew something was not right and went to urgent care.
515,Shingles vaccine: Yeah I had a mild case and my torso felt like it was on fire for a few weeks.
516,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: My sibling had shingles at 41 and it was a very miserable experience. I would get the vaccine before 50 if available.
520,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Ridiculous. Exhaustion was my first symptom then back pain and while I had a mild case the exhaustion lasted a month or so. I could function but barely
521,Booster issues in vascular surgery: My 80 year old neighbor got the shingles after being jabbed. I tried to warn him the wonderful medical professionals got to him. Revelation 218
523,Hello if you are like me you are going crazy searching the Internet for information about your newly discovered CIN 123. Ill tell you my story in hopes that you find some peace and calm during this very scary process. I have birth September 172023 With my first son my babys weight was 8.12 pounds and I had a tear in my vaginal wall. I went for my 6 week post check up and had a pap done which showed HPV16 positive and ASCUS. I Have gone to the gyno regularly and I had never been HPV16 positive and I Have been with my husband since I was 19 I am now 32 years old. I did have partners before him and he did Aswell so we could have gotten the HPV from any of these. I guess it laid dormant until I gave birth and my immune system went crazy. The doctor scheduled a COLPO right away and did the biopsy finding CIN 12 on two sections and CIN 23 in another section this was in December. He scheduled the LEEP for January 2nd Ill never forget it was very scary but you have to do it for your own good. I went to do the LEEP I would recommend taking some Motrin before I could not take much since I was breastfeeding my son. It was uncomfortable but you can handle it. I did cry a little but just from all the shit I was going through my emotions went crazy I was just 3 months postpartum going through this I felt like i was going to have something worse.. the C word. The LEEP was successful. The doctor suggested to get the GARDISIL shot and I did I complete my 3rd those this week. A week later I got my results of the LEEP CLEAR MARGINS I wanted to cry finally I started taking vitamins tumeric vitamins green tea vitamins postpartum vitamin. I went into my 6 month check up to do a PAP and it came back clean HPV and clear everything. Now I have to go back to do the other 6 month PAP I AM PRYING Ill be done with this for good and everything comes back negative.
525,I had no reaction to covid vaccinations shingrix. I Am usually a side effect queen so was pleasantly surprised. Nada nothing. I hope same for you
527,Shingles and other Vaccines: I have known sevetal people who have gotten shingles it is a PAINFUL MISERY. One person got their outbreak on their chest at first they thought they were having a heart attack it hurt so badly.
529,"Varicella like rash only 24 hours post vaccination?: 18 month old male. No known medical condition or allergies. My son received the dtap and varicella vaccine approx 12 hours before developing a chicken pox like rash. I would assume it's a varicella vaccine associated rash but from all my online ""research"" the earliest onset of rash like symptoms post vaccination is 5 days. I'm trying to determine if it is varicella and if he would be contagious (either acquired in community or from vaccine). Developped 50+ red lesions on mostly one side of face approx 18 hours post vaccination. Has significant redness, swelling at injection site. Afebrile. Asymptomatic."
530,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: The timing of the antivirals really seems to be a factor in how much Shingles hangs on. And your hearing problem has to be so irritating. When I first started researching my Shingles I found one woman's account on the internet where she had Shingles on her eardrum repeatedly. Yikes. I do have your hitandrun pains when the nerves seem to be repairing at least that is what I hope they are doing. I have never had Bell's but I have had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome once. My mouth drooped and dribbled and I could not completely close my eye. I know this sounds whiney but the worst part was not knowing if it would be permanent. It was not valacyclovir chased it away but I was scared. Between that and loss of balance and loss of feeling in my torso I felt like my body was just falling apart. I could not cough my gastrointestinal system just stopped and I had no appetite eating nearly nothing for the first weeks. The exhaustion was partially from the relapse and partially from not being able to sleep at best getting two hours a night. To answer your question my worst pain is aways headache pain which feels like it is in the bone. Drugs do not do much for it and Gabapentin makes me feel befuddled so I stay away from that. Time is the only remedy for those and it usually takes months rather than weeks for them to subside. I wish had useful answers for you but all I can offer is this you are not alone. And I can say that the more I look for answers for myself the luckier I realize I am. Other posts talk about the most Godawful symptoms and side effects that make stumping around on a cane for a couple of months sound like a pleasure cruise. The anxiety your doctors sneered at is the result of worrying about real symptoms it is not the disease itself. Your frustration with them must lead to even more anxiety. I totally sympathize. Try to rest as much as possible it is good for nerve repair. Once I am on the mend I can literally feel from day to day where something now worksfeels better than the day before even if it is just a little less irritating. Like I said time. It does not heal all but it does give you a measuring stick for overcoming what is happened to you. And make no mistake this happened to you did not beat the weeds looking for it. The Shingles lottery is one with the worst prizes. Take care and a hug for you where it does not hurt.
531,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: I got shingles young as a junior in high school and a rebound case as a senior. The first time took about 8 weeks to fully recover from. I maybe could have tried running at that point but the neuralgia was worse along my bra line so I could not wear one for a few more weeks. The second time only took 6 weeks to get feeling better and no residual neuralgia. Shingles suck. I would not wish them on anyone. I hope you get feeling better soon
532,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: I am 34 and am currently suffering from shingles. I deeply regret deciding not to get the shingles vaccine when my PCP recommended it last year.
536,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Mom was practically thrilled when the wave of Chicken pox hit us kids back in the day. Fairly mundane sickness at the time IIRC did get sick of hearing 'do not scratch' though. However after my Grandma died a painful death that went off the scale after Shingles I practically ran to the Pharmacy to get the Shingrix vaccine.
541,41 and got Shingles: Fascinating I got it 2 years ago and again recently after surgery and a lot of stress at home. Just a small patch. But the nerve pain after it started healing was next level. It hurt to walk and I could not stand having fabric on it. Antiinflammatories were very helpful in alleviating the nerve pain for me
542,My skin on stomach and back has felt like the worst sunburn in the world. I am trying to figure out what is causing it. I have been on Oz them pic for around six months for Diabetes. Doctor said it sounds like Shingles pain but there are no visible signs and it is on both sides. I have had the Shingles vaccine. Doc is givin e me meds for Shingles but it has not changed. Anyone had this issue?
543,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Same first dose was like a flu shot second knocked me on my ass. Be grateful the current version is much better than the one from 15 years ago a friend took that and it actually gave him shingles did that to a small amount of people. But yes knew several people that got shingles and it is worth it to get the shots.
544,I Am going to try not to make this too long hope someone has the energy to read it as I just feel hopeless and it would be nice to hear from someone who has similar experiencesalthough I would not wish for my worst enemy to have to go through this. Two and a half years ago my F36life changed I got a serious case of Shingles affecting both sides of my body and face. First thought it was herpes as it was so spread across my body but I got the blisters on my ears tested and it was positive for Herpes Zoster. Along with the blisters I got terrible neck and back pain a burning sensation going up and down my spine pain in my eyes vomiting for days at a time tingling numbness and an incredibly weak feeling in my whole body and a bunch of other symptoms. I obviously rushed to the emergency but they did not find anything wrong except for the Herpes Zoster positive test. I got a prescription for Valacyklovir that I took for 2 weeks but it really only helped with the skin issues and nothing more. Since then my health has just been terrible. I experience a constant brain fog with blurry vision double vision and everything constantly feels like a dream. The symptoms I had during my first outbreak have been constantly reocurring along with so many other things. I rarely have nauseavomiting any more though so I am thankful for that but new weird symptoms seem to be adding to the list all the time. At the moment the most difficult thing is my inner ears feeling constantly blocked and a tapping noise occuring every few seconds. My whole body especially face neck and jaw feels extremely tense and weak at the same time. I have a feeling of pressure in my head body feels numb and am so tired mentally and physically. Doctors do not want to prescribe suppressive treatment with antivirals several have said that they do not belive its shingles as it affected both sides of my body despite the positive test. I still get blisters in ears mouth nose and my eyes get painful and bloodshot. Since doctors are not taking me seriously I am at a loss going to different specialists for the different symptoms but not getting any help. I did get to do an MRI on the brain which was normal it was a relief to know it was not MS but to be honest also a bit dissapointing because at least that would have been treatable to some extent and I would know what is wrong with me. My iron and ferritine levels have been found to be very low but getting iron infusion and getting my values up to normal has not really changed anything. I am reluctant to take the shingles vaccine because this whole thing started shortly after taking the Pfizer Covid boozter shot and I am afraid that it could somehow make everything worse. I am thankful for anyone who wants to share any similar experience or if you have any suggestions of treatmentmedical or natural supplements. I am starting to give up the idea that I will ever feel normal again but I do not want to because I am basically alone with my two kids and I want to be here for them for a long time.
548,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am in the exact same position currently. Had chickenpox party about 28 years ago and as of today have had a shingles flare up for a week.
550,Shingles vaccine: My husband and I had no problems from the vaccine. Highly recommend
552,Shingles?: it is definitely a dilemma. I have been putting off the shingles vaccine for 8 years now I am terrified of it and my adverse reaction to the covid vaccine made me hesitant to take any un familar vaccine at all. I have never had shingles nor chicken pox that I am aware of although blood tests show that I have immunity to chicken pox so I must have had an a symptomatic case as a child since the vaccine did not exist when I was young.
554,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: For a fun time look up post herpetic neuralgia. My poor husband suffered for more than a year after his initial outbreak. It was grim. His doctor explained it to me by saying the nerve pain is like having a toothache on 14 of your body. Two or three days of blah is nothing.
558,First shingles vaccine side effects: Like hit you the hardest for a week? I am so fing tired and the brain fog is ridiculous.
559,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: I got a very mild case at 33 after Covid. Thought it was my skin freaking out from a new soap or something but it became very apparent very quickly that it was not an allergic reaction. I ended up just calling my PCP a few days later because again the outbreak was super minor. He asked if the rash crossed the midline and when I said no he went congrats that sounds like shingles.
560,Do you suggest getting my 11 year old daughter the HPV vaccine? Has anyone ever had adverse side effects from it?: Your husband made a comment? Like did you ask him why he would think the HPV vaccine would paralyze her? Like in 2022 38 of all adolescent girls in the US received at least one of the vaccine. Are we having an epidemic of paralysis in the US? Look you know that this is goofy. It is just stuck in your brain now like What if she gets in a terrible accident after she starts driving? or all the other whatifs in life. Has anyone ever had adverse side effects from it? besides a sore arm Yes. Someone will chime in here to say that they developed Something Horrible which they attribute to the vaccine. But you need to look for populationbased evidence that there is an increase in Something Horrible happening in teenage girls  young women before you ascribe any causation. ...And you would need to compare that increase in SH against the risk of cervical cancer.
561,Undiagnosed Shingles: I had Botox injections into the affected site. It immediately stopped the extreme pain and I completely got off of pain meds. After a month I still had some discomfort and the doc told me to do physiotherapy which also helped. Since then the remaining discomfort is fading away slowly. It was a miracle.
562,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it in the early 90s I think not long before the vaccine became available. I definitely got every available vaccine I was one of the first signed up for the HPV vaccine when it became available when I was in hs
565,I had shingles last year. I was covid vaccinated 3 years back. I was surprised when I had shingles.
566,Under 50 Shingles Vaccine Question: I just found on the CDC website that there are special populations that should get the vaccine: <url> Scroll down to the special population section. It doesn't say anything about age or immune system for those with a history of shingles: Special Populations Persons with a history of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster can recur. Adults with a history of herpes zoster should receive RZV.
567,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I was 21 or 22 when I got shingles. Luckily it was a pretty mild case but it hurt like a terrible sunburn If she cannot do math and thinks you are 50 take that vaccine if you want lol. Also the other day a kid asked me did you have the internet when you were young I am barely 30 lol
571,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Yay So glad you did it now you just have to go back in 6 months and do part 2. But then that is it you are good for the rest of your life. I had some bad chills and aches for a day both times but compared to the pain of actually getting shingles it is a price worth paying. Everyone else get your vaccine too. Next up colonoscopy pneumonia vaccine.
574,Burning pain but not severe: I was diagonsed with shingles 10 days back been on antivirals aciclovir 1.2g since then 3 tabletdays. Now the inflammation and itching has almost reduced and burning sensation is gone. Though sometimes i feel numbness adjacent to the infected area. Just be careful to take medicines on time. Also no matter what do not allow yourself to take stress. You will have a good recovery.
579,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: My son who is in his 20s was required by the state law to get the chicken pox vaccine. He was exposed as a baby but never got them and at one year he got the first shot. Senior year of high school there was a big outburst of chickenpox in his school system. He was required to get the second shot or face 3 weeks off of school because he had not gotten the second shot yet. I am not going to get into his vaccine dad and stepmom but needless to say he had to fight them on getting it and he won that fight. As a senior he did not want to miss 3 weeks of school because of chickenpox. So before you go down in the ones that cut the chickenpox vaccines you need to rethink that a little bit. A lot of the ones that do have it got it as babies when their parents took them to get the vaccines. And some state required the second dose vaccine for school records.
587,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am permanently scarred from it. I have a chicken pox scar nearly square in the middle of my forehead. Like permant bindi on my forehead. My wife on the other hand never got sent to one. I do love the South Park episode where they gave all their parents herpes as revenge.
593,Nanny Candidate Vaccine Status: There have been tons of comments already so I do not know if you will even get to this one. And it may be an unpopular opinion. Nevertheless I wanted to give you a bit more perspective. I am a pediatric surgeon a mother and have a nanny for when I Am at work frequently so 24 hr calls. I am by no means an vaccine and my children have had all the normal vaccinations. I have had all standard vaccinations as well. MMR is in my mind to be expected for everyone. That they should have has earlier in life and does not require updates. Tdap should be updated during every pregnancy for adult women and for any adults that will be around baby. This is to increase immunity for pertussis whooping cough which is very serious for newborns and can be fatal prior to the age when they can be immunized themselves. I would want this updated. I will be updating myself this year as I care for infants regularly as part of my job. Flu I am more ambivalent about. I get it annually as most hospitals require it but each year is quite variable as to the level of effectiveness for strains so I understand why people have variable feelings about it. Covid is in another category for me and I have read about it extensively. I had the original rounds in the beginning before I really knew enough about it and when it was mandated for health care workers anyway. I will not be getting anymore boosters. My children have not had Covid shots and they never will. It is not necessary for children and does not have a track record for safety or even for preventing Covid. It is nearly impossible to measure a benefit in young healthy children because the mortality rate is so low 0.03. It is certainly your right to have any requirement you like for vaccinations. That being said I Am not sure its even a benefit to you or to your newborn to have your nanny Covid vaccinated. If they have already had it which most have at this point natural immunity is superior. Boosters are now only really recommended for the elderly. If it reduces catching covid at all it is for a relatively short time. It does not in general prevent catching covid or transmitting it to others if you have it and do not know. The primary purpose at this point would be to reduce severity of illness. This may be helpful in al older at risk patient. But for a younger healthy adult it may just make it less apparent that they are sick which would in turn paradoxically increase the likelihood they would be around your newborn while having covid because the symptoms may be very mild or even asymptomatic. The mRNA vaccine platform had never been previously shown effective and because of the very rapid time course of its development it was not required to meet the same standards of effectiveness as other standard vaccines. They have been trying for 30 years to develop mRNA vaccines primarily against HIV has not worked out. So while I do not consider myself in any way to be an anti vaccine or even a pro alternative medicine doctor I literally operate on children every single day I think Covid vaccination is unwise and there is a lot to answer for in how it was presented to the public. So that my way more than 2 cents. Bottom line do what makes you feel most comfortable. If it will make you anxious then its not worth it. I would not take her without Tdap for a newborn I would prefer flu I would not insist or even prefer covid. And I do not worry about it one bit when I Am at work many of the children I care for have active viral and bacterial infections when I see them. Pretty sure I had pertussis this past winter. I coughed for 6 weeks straight they call whooping cough the 100 day cough lol. I will be updating my Tdap this year and I think I might get RSV vaccine as well. That one is absolutely rampant nowadays. If there is anything besides pertussis I would not want my newborn to have it would be RSV. Good luck.
596,For the shingles triggered by the covid vaccine you mean
598,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: The vaccine only prevents chickenpox. However it prevents shingles as a byproduct because you never got infected with the chickenpox virus its the exact same herpes virus. Once you have had chickenpox the virus lays dormant in your spine and can become reactivated due to stress weakened immune system or totally randomly and it presents itself as shingles. I had shingles twice at 18 and 20 otherwise physically healthy.
599,I am so sorry I did NOT get a reaction from the Shingles vaccine one or two.
601,Rash presented on my breast and luckily got put on Prednisone and Valacyclovir after day and a half. Nerve pain started the next day from my fingers to the top of my arm. Progressed into my shoulder blade and neck then up to my face. Stabbing pain only happened one day thankfully but constant feeling of numbness and tingling ever since. Tingling has now spread down to my knee. Is it possible the shingles is bringing out old injuries? I had two bad falls on my left knee a couple of years ago and was experiencing carpal tunnel pain in my left wrist for a few months. Seems too coincidental that these are flaring up now. I have only taken one dose of gabapentin so far and it knocked me out. Not really sure how I will be able to work feeling so exhausted and typing with my left hand.
603,Shingles is brutal if that helps you avoid even a minor case it will be worth it. One never knows how a body reacts to vaccine as a kid I was given a booster shot in school that night my arm blew up to three times it size and I had a very high fever but I survived
604,"Want to update: This morning I am proud to announce I am wearing pants and thong underwear!!! I did get the chickenpox vaccine three days ago now the varicella and I'm feeling really good. I am still taking seven supplements but that does include the vitamin D, zinc and my omeprazole that I was taking before for my Gerd I no longer I'm taking the AV or the gabapentin for nerve pain. After I took the side B, it was a very scary time for me due to my exaggerated symptoms of the herpes virus after administering it I just wanted to come in here. I don't know if it was due to the acupuncture and the Japanese vitamins she gave me I have been taking those or the varicella shot or that the Sadbe is just wearing off I'm not sure but I feel like I'm back to normal!!!"
606,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had it in my 20s induced by stress apparently. 0 stars do not recommend.
608,Shingles vaccine experience: The thing about shingles is that they tend to surface during times of extreme stress like cancer treatments. My mom had shingles a patch about 4x4 inches on her lower back right over her spine. She was already weakened by chemo and radiation. She described it as a giant bee sting radiating pain constantly. I do not need any persuasion on this one.
610,: I began doing Fasted exercise at the beginning of the lockdown in March of 2020 I am a Certified Fitness Instructor and a former type 2 diabetic 20 plus years. The Fasted exercising led to me pushing back my 1st meal of the day unconsciously BEFORE my 1st vaccine in 2021 and began my unintentional reversing of type 2 and high blood pressure. I doubled vaccine and boosted during my start of intentional Fasting and had none of the bad side effects of the vaccine. All three times I got vaccine I got them in a Fasted state because I wanted to get them with an optimized immune system. By the way I am female and aged 72. I also changed what I ate in 2022. Went Low Carb High Fat now I am Ketovoire eating once or twice a day. I am either an 186 or 204 Faster. I have not felt this good and fabulous since 2001
615,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I have had both. Other than a sore arm never felt bad for either one. Guess I got lucky.
616,Shingles vaccine experience: I had both shingles vaccines and they were nothing. Ill take a sore arm over shingles any day. My dad 80 had shingles and said it was awful.
617,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I Am only 45 so I cannot get the vaccine unless I self pay. I got shingles two years ago on my face and scalp and the bumps started showing up on my eye. Thankfully they increased my antiviral medication and it started to go down immediately but I had severe pain for at least a week.
626,Anyone feel like they got hit by a bus after getting Shingrix Vaccine?: For me not until the next day. I thought the arm pain was worse though that was almost a week. Everything hurt ached for about 24 hours for me. I would just prepare yourself advil Tylenol meals premade if someone isn t cooking for you. I had only a mild case of shingles and that is was much worse compared to even a mild case let alone a moderate or severe case the vaccine is nothing.
627,Tell me about your vaccine flares: No shingles booster. Developed an allergy to the flu shot. Flu or COVID vaccine would have me down at least 3 days with pain and fatigue. Really should get a chicken pox shot since I am around little kids more at this point. Dragging my feet.
631,Hi all my LO is 3 weeks old and has been exclusively FF. No regrets this is my 3rd and I have major PTSD from trying breastfeeding with my first. Anyway we have already gone through our first cold but my cold has turned into bronchitis or something causing mucus in my chest with a pretty bad sounding cough. I Am terrified baby will get it. I did get the RSV vaccine while I was pregnant. Anyway I have provably a few drops of breast milk left almost dried up but I do wake up with spots on my shirt at night. Should I try pumping and getting some to feed? Or what I Am hoping someone will tell me is that formula has the same nutrients and not to stress about it? The PTSD from my first does give me some mom guilt she is not getting your antibodies intrusive thoughts. Thanks
633,Shingles vaccine: I had no side effects except it felt like someone punched me in the arm. I have also had shingles and the shot was far less painful.
634,Shingles vaccine second dose: I had an OK experience with both shots. I moved my arm A LOT. I got the shot in the morning and carried a 3 lb weight around most of the day and kept my arm moving. Sounds mental but it really helped.
636,Shingrix: Am on Rinvoq and had shingrix. It made me flare and gave me some exciting side effects but.... it also was not too bad as far as these go. Extra stiffness and finger pain. Having had shingles? Well worth it coz that was a LOT worse.
638,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: That 2nd shot fucked with most of my friends and I dreaded it. The idea of getting shingles was worse so I bit the bullet and did it. I was lucky no issues Arm was sore for a few hours but other than that nothing. I just hope that the shot took.
642,Shingles vaccine second dose: I am just getting over the 2nd dose today. I got the shot on Wednesday. Way better than shingles. Good luck
644,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I went to every kid's house in town that got chicken pox. Funny I never got chicken pox. However I do have a positive titer for them. Enough exposure I guess. My parents wanted me to get the pox young as they tend to be worse in adults than children. Sorry for the shingles they are awful. I just finished my vaccination series for them. Do not know your age but anyone over 50 can get vaccinated.
649,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Comparing my case of the shingles that I had in my 30s to the shingles vaccine that I got in my 60s Ill take the vaccine any day
650,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Yeah I had shingles in 2014 ooof talk about a rough painful month for both front AND back. Some on the chest but most on back shoulder blade. Had to have a cold washcloth to sleep on that entire time
651,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was vaccinated had chicken pox and now have longterm Bell's Palsy. So I do not think there ever really was a perfect answer for our generation.
654,Shingles shot: No reaction at all for either shot. Never have a reaction to any shots from flu to COVID. Every one handles it differently.
655,"Just received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine and less than 48 hours later, I noticed a rash developing on the left side of my torso. It's getting bigger, itchier, and slightly stinging. Could this be a shingles rash? I've already ruled out poison ivy and any other chemical irritants. The rash hasn't appeared anywhere else on my body."
659,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: just got my second one yesterday. other than a sore arm no side effects
662,"Received Pfizer COVID Vaccine, Developed Bell's Palsy: Unexpected turn of events. A few days after getting my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I woke up with a drooping left side of my face and difficulty closing my eye. Visited the doctor, who diagnosed me with Bell's Palsy. Here's a brief timeline: 1. **Day 1** - got vaccinated, felt fine 2. **Day 2** - woke up with facial weakness, trouble smiling or blinking 3. **Day 3** - consulted doctor, confirmed Bell's Palsy, prescribed medication 4. **Day 4** - struggling with facial paralysis, feeling self-conscious The healthcare provider mentioned that while rare, cases of Bell's Palsy post-vaccination have been reported. Despite the unexpected outcome, I'm thankful for the vaccine's protection. Anyone else encounter Bell's Palsy after the Pfizer shot? How long did it take for your symptoms to improve? Any advice on managing facial paralysis? Mid-thirties here, navigating this new challenge. ---"
665,But it is still better than shingles. I have had shingles and they are very painful and last for weeks. The reaction from the vaccine only bothered me for about a day each time. Some mild flu symptoms. Then no more shingles to worry about ever.
666,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles 2 years ago at 58. You do not want shingles. Single must mind numbing pain. I have now gotten the vaccine Easy ready. Again.. you do not want shingles. Ever.
674,Bout of shingles after getting the shot?: I Have heard the same. Expect to feel real bad after that second shot. So I plan to stay home and claim full ownership of the remote control and have ice cream and declare that the calories do not count.
676,Hi all I am looking for a bit of doc advice if possible. I was diagnosed with shingles on Monday. In terms of timeline its been 5 days since I noticed the rash appearing on my back and have been taking antiviral meds famciclovir for last 3 days. The rash has evolved quite a bit since Sunday in terms of the size but the pain has not been too bad. I do not have any other symptoms that I have read about fever headache flu like symptoms it really is just a rash that feels a little uncomfortable at times. Myself and a group of friends have had a weekend away planned this weekend for quite sometime and even though I feel fine to go one of my friends 32M has never had chickenpox nor have they been vaccinated against it and I would not want to put them at risk. Is this person at particularly high risk being around someone with shingles as I understand chickenpox as an adult can sometimes be more severe. Appreciate any advice.
680,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Brother I got shingles a few years ago and I am in my 30s. it is extremely painful the nerve pain lingered for many months afterwards. My outbreak was not even that bad compared to the photos you see online. The motion of just your tshirt rubbing against your skin causes pain. I would highly recommend everyone to get vaccine
682,19F Shingles around my breast armpit and back. Symptoms for the last 5 days. Doc diagnosed me today and did not give me a straight answer
684,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had shingles when I was five. Yes ... I got an old person disease at the age of five. I love telling doctors that because they look at me like I have three heads. I do not remember much from that year of my life but I sure as heck remember the pain from shingles in my special place. I spent a week or two in an oatmeal bath. It wrapped around the nerves and came out my back leaving a nasty scar that has since faded. I got the shot a year or two ago. I do not want to do it again.
687,Reddit server keeps on saying error on replying so I am creating a whole post in the hope it may be helpful for other people looking at a GPA diagnosis I am hoping to get a diagnosis soon to stop me deteriorating. here is a summary of my symptoms. first started in 2009 when i was 21 now almost 36 year old. was pretty minor seziure episodes and episode of tonsillitis but then got runny nose and postnasala drip and tonsil stones for the next 3 years. In 2016 i really felt unwell and have never been back to baseline since then. in 2017 i suspected i had some autoimmune condition especially as i had rashes and weakness headaches joint pain that never fully resolved. looking at it looks like every 7 years it flares up as I am in a mjaor flare now in 2024 I am currently looking for a diagnosis. Been ill since the age of 21 with seizure like episodes and runny nose tonsil tones and conjunctivitis. 7 years after first symptoms I got sudden knee pain pelvis moved out of place hip pain loss of appetite and cold tingling sensations in body followed by headaches and small nosebleeds and increase in seizures. Got diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia and vitamin d deficiency high globulin serum and neutropenia. ANA ANCA negative but the test they did was basic ana anca panel. From 2017 onwards had a shingled type rash appear on upper back spread across upper arms face neck and lower back. would not disappear but after 7 months changed into a pink itchy rash of little blobs. Developed dry  gritty eyes not responsive to eyedrops. Hip pain got worse. chiropractic manipulations affected my pelvis more and physio and osteopath and private massage did not help. Started getting bruises a lot on my legs and pain in both legs shoulder elbow due to pelvic obliquity. nerve pain in face especially like trigeminal and occipital neuralgia. Developed burning pain in nose on and off. in 2015 had granuloma rash on back of left leg for 1 year 201920 more granuloma rashes near hip and knee but they disappeared after one month. since 2022 getting granuloma red rash by lips and chin and skin on my cheeks goes red raised bumpy. In 2022 sudden onset of dizziness and feeling of ear pressure in one ear. came and went and thought I had menieres and have family history of menieres. More rashes appeared on body which looked like granuloma annulare. never been able to get dr to biopsy any rashes as they refused. In 2022 started getting reflux symptoms. Roll on to october 2024 i had a cold. November 2024 what I thought was a new cold coming on but felt different. Voice lost for 1 day next day hoarse voice and sore throat. Started sneezing in evening and runny nose. following day nose bunged up with lots of green phlemg. when I sneezed all the pressure went to throat and nose would not blow. Strange sensation like a blocked vacuum tube running frommy nose to my throat. Started to feel better after few days then developed extreme ear pain headache neck pressure. heaaches if i bent over with the sinusisits. was diagnosed by dr as otitis media and started antibiotics for it and eardrops. then developed terrible calf pain right after taking eardrops. was unsure if it was allergy tendonitis due to the eadrops so stopped using them. green phlegm disappeared and felt like sinusitis getting better. ear pain improved but then I suddnely started spitting out blood. went to a and e dr who sent me home saying just chest infection. that night felt chest pressure after coughing fainting high heart rate on bp monitor at home i was lying down and it went from 100 146. fainting every time i got up. coughing struggling for breath high pitched whooping cough souns which I now think are stridor'. went back to ae as was still coughing up blood. CT pulmonary artery showed pulmnary embolism with right sided heart strain my platelets dropped from 327 49 in 5 days. Started on high dose prednisolone in hospital heparin infusion for pulmonary embolism. day before discharge i received a positive blood test result forANCA ANTIMPO antibodies. doctors did not read my results or notes before discharging me. Now the problem is all of my symptoms match Granulomatosis with polyangitis wegeners but I am still waiting for rheumatology referral. my old skin rash has come back. I need it biopsied. I am on prednisolone but weaning down by 10mg each week currently on 50mg on weds start on 40mg in january i run out of prednisolone and cannot get more unless I can force the drs to take me seriously. I have a medical knowledge background due to my job so I am a bit more aware of medical procedures and symptoms than most people which helps me to advocate for myself but the problem is lots of red tape in the UK NHS. since getting home i have still been out of breath sore throat worse when talking or exertion and feeling of ears getting muffled again ear discharge. strange feelig in thorat like lymph nodes presure. yawning hurts my throat. i think i have subglottic stenosis now caused by wegeners granulomatosis and the steroids are not enough. The ct scan and echo could not properly visuale my inferior vena cava and upon reaearching online sometimes people are misdiagnosed as PE when they have hughes stovin syndrome or pulmonary haemorrhage due to Wegeners. I am getting my bloodwork checked every week now but they are only really bothered about my platelets. prednisolone is increasing my platelets but because I had PE and posible DVT and because GPA increases your risk of blood clots I do not want my platelets getting too high and causing more clots. I am on Xarelto for the pulmonary embolism.
689,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Got the vaccine. It is basically 24 hours of discomfort. I do not recommend getting the Shingles vaccine and the COVID vaccine on the same day. That kind of sucked.
692,Shingles second shot update.: That is me too. I have been hesitant with the shingles vaccine after the horrible reactions to the covid jabs. Maybe I can ask for a geriatric dose? Lol
694,Flu vaccine and pseudo relapse: I just got my annual flu shot and my body went into what I HOPE is a pseudo relapse. My chronic fatigue has worsened significantly. I already take vitamin D supplements and my doctor has adjusted my medication. Has anyone else faced this issue? How long did it persist? Should I opt for the pneumonia vaccine as well?
698,Hello This is my first ever post on Reddit I usually see the occasional videos of A IT A on YouTube and Tik Tok but never logged on to Reddit until today so I m sorry if my post seems out of norms T LR I had chickenpox as a newborn and never gained immunity even after getting the vaccine. What should I do? Do I bother getting the varicella vaccine again or ask for Shin gri x? I 26 F am in 3rd year of Optometry school and will soon go out to ex tern ships in May. Part of the process of preparing for it is submitting my proof of immunization to Castle Branch. I m the storyteller friend in my friend group and the joke for all storytellers is that we will start the story since the time we were born and this story starts when I was a week or 2 old because when I was a week old my brother had chickenpox so I got chickenpox then too. It is in my medical record so I never had to do any of the varicella vaccines because I had chickenpox so I m already immune When I started optometry school in 2020 we were required to start the t it ers vaccination process for ex tern ships and when I did my first set of t it ers MMR T Dap He p B and Varicella varicella came back negative. That was a plot twist to me but the nurses said maybe because you were only a week old passive immunity save you then I did the full series for varicella vaccines and submitted it to Castle Branch but they denied my proof of vaccination because of the initial negative tite r that was submitted. So now at this point I decided to recheck my tite r when I went in for my yearly TB quant if er on. and my varicella tite r is still negative. What do I do? Some pharmacists are recommending to get the vaccine again but i dk if the normal situation of it was bad batch are the same since I had the actual virus when I was a newborn. Some are wondering if I should just get the Shin gri x vaccine since even people who don t remember having chickenpox can get it. What do I do?
707,Was severely injured by a DPT shot in the 80's. No way I trusted any doctor with shots after all the stuff I went thru. Shingles allergies all my allergic reactions were anaphylaxis broken nose etc.
708,my mom is 81: My mother got shingles right after a steriod shot
709,Shingles vaccine does not fuck around. First Covid knocked me down for a day. I could not imagine doing a bunch on one day.
710,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: I was admitted for pree and SFGR at 315 delivered at 33 exactly. I was discharged 3 days later and my baby graduated the NICU in 22 days. She was also a wait and watch for feedinggrowingtemp regulation. I began tapering off BP meds the week after delivering and was off all of them by two weeks post. I experienced headaches towards the end of the pregnancy and during my stay in the hospital. They gradually went away within the first couple of weeks after delivery. Thankfully never had any severe vision changes.
715,Do I have scabies?: Shingles can be really painful but not always. I have had shingles 4 times and the first time I had it did not hurt that bad but the second time was awful.
716,Shingles Is NO Joke: I am currently on Rinvoq waitinghoping for it to work for me. I was near remission on Humira but got Covid for the first time after xmas 2023 which made Humira stop working somehow? and have been in an uncontrolled flare ever since. I swear we all need a shirt that says Personally victimized by my immune system.
717,Vulvar shingles at 15dpo: I too discovered what I would describe as ulcers on my labia after surgery. I also had a blistery rash on my abdomen and under one breast. I called it shingles jokingly and never consulted with my surgeon. I assumed it was all reactions to surgical soaps gloves tapes or tools. It took about 3 weeks for it all to clear up. Now you have got me wishing I had pursued treatment or at least diagnosis. Maybe it was shingles. Glad you are feeling better. Best wishes for continued recovery
718,Will I get to 100?: I had chicken pox as a child but during anthrax and small pox vaccinations caused me to have shingles. To which I Have had 5 times before 26 years old 38 now
719,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am a younger millenial who was lucky enough to have not had it yet when the vaccine came out. My wife had it bad as a kid and her parents had to sock her hands. To Be Honest nothing pisses me off more than current parents do this instead of just getting their kids the damn shot. I never had it. My little sister born post shot had it twice but it was so mild she had a few spots and basically just stayed home a week and played unbothered. Kids can get horribly sick when you could have prevented it.
720,RSV vaccine vs antibodies: My baby got both. I would still get the vaccine because that is immediately available to baby and then see if you can get the antibodies. There was a massive shortage when my baby was born and there is no guarantee that will not happen again. Here is info on both.
721,I had shingles for the second time in April then again in July. I Am an avid runner and recently returned to running after taking some time off to recover. Since that time I Am struggling on runs. I find it challenging to pace my breathing patterns and my heart rate has been skyrocketing to the point where I have to stop running and walk. I Have never had this issue before and I Have been running consistently since 2017. Anyone have similar experiences?
722,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Yes I had the shingles about 56 weeks ago. It was only a small patch but the nerve pain was nuts. I Have just now stopped feeling the sunburned feeling except for one small patch on my upper thigh.
725,Side effects after 4 years?: Could you be having some labrynthitis as a result of shingles? I get labrynthitis from time to time and it causes nausea and anxiety because my balance system is off.
726,Shingles vaccine: Get. The. Shot. I Have had shingles I was 31 and I had the shingle vaccine. The actual shingles are a terrible way to spend a week or two. The shot? Mildly uncomfortable.
727,Shingles again?: Wow 15 times. I cannot imagine and I Am sorry that you have to deal with that I Am really hoping this is not shingles but I do not know what else it could be. Today the burningtingling has abated a lot but the area is still sensitive and I feel achey on that side. Does this ever happen to you before the rash appears? I feel like the first time the rash came by this point. Its making me so anxious.
728,Sadbe Questions: I will definitely stick to the ones I ve been taking. The are helping me in some way. I m able to function throughout my day. The nerve pain inflammation is still noticeable. Question I took the shingles vaccine only one dose I was told I had shingles that s how I was diagnosed do you think that will have any effect on Sad be work?
731,Naw 80s Bavaria and older just got shingles from the damn vaccines they gave us. They still do the vaccine though.
740,I wanted to share our RSV experience as much of what I found on this sub was horror stories which sent me into a spiral. We were fortunate to not have that bad of a case for our LO. LO was supposed to start daycare today and I was so worried about what sickness he would get first was. Joke was on me because he got RSV last week from who knows where Husband and I go out and do things often with him so it could have been anywhere. Timeline Sunday Nov 24 symptoms started light congestion. No fever Monday continued from Sunday Tuesday symptoms got much worse cough felt endless and LO was crying every minute he was awake. Still no fever Tuesday evening I noticed retractions so called our pediatrician nurse hotline who recommended we go to hospital checked him out monitored  we were sent home. The only thing they did was suction out his mucus which caused a nice improvement in his oxygen levels was around 90 before  was 97ish after suction. They actually sent us home before we got the viral panel back as his vitals were fine  there was not more for them to do. I got the results for RSV positive online when I got home. Wednesday day 4 was about the same as Tuesday but I did get an Owlet to monitor his blood oxygen which helped me so much have peace of mind his blood oxygen was about 93 this day LOTS of sleep  cuddles Thursday Thanksgiving did not complain about having to stay home on Thanksgiving better than Wednesday but still gnarly cough Friday  Sunday days 68 each day a little better than the next blood oxygen gradually better each day Monday Day 9 visited pediatrician who said hes all clear to start daycare  that if anything I was overly cautious which duh he still has minor cough but is smiling again and is back to my happy baby We did not yet have the RSV vaccine prior to him getting the virus we actually got the vaccine for him today. I Am very proud of how my little guy did with his first sickness He was such a trooper  honestly slept better than normal with this sickness. Honestly I Am glad to have it out of the way. TLDR while RSV can be very serious and should be monitored closely at the end of the day its a cold and many babies do not have serious cases that land them in the hospital. Do Not panic but stay on top of the symptoms.
741,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 84 Caught it accidentally in 1993 a year before the vaccine was approved. Got Bells Palsy as a side effect of the virus. Have Not had shingles yet.
742,"Feeling frustrated... just need to vent: So I've been managing my MS and UC without medication for years, but recent tests showed my diseases are still very active. Now I have to start on Zeposia, but first, I had to catch up on vaccinations. After receiving the Hep A/B and shingles vaccines, both of my illnesses are flaring up. Dealing with insurance to get approved for the meds is adding to the stress. It's disheartening to see everything I've worked for potentially unravel due to these vaccinations. Has anyone else gone through something like this?"
743,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: May you never have another Sorry the side effects of the vaccine were rough on you OP. Many of my friends said the same thing. Short lived pain for long lived gain Take care.
744,: Of course this is the result of a damn bioweapon. I got the vaccine and my family members too. It causes me fear and hopelessness. What a crime against humanity. God will tell.
745,Everything You Need to Know About Shingrix  CDC experts: the side effects were much less severe after my second dose.
748,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My husband and I were both down for almost a week in January. It was brutal.
749,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Zillenial. Got my chicken pox shots. Never had chicken pox but caught shingles at 26
750,Shingles and GenX: I got shingles 24 years ago and got permanent nerve damage from it so I get to experience the pain every day for the rest of my life. The shot is nothing compared to that.
751,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I have asthma and whenever I get sick it goes down into my chest.
753,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: ....the vaccine came out in 95? Yikes. I think my sister and I got it when I was in 1st grade so around 96 or 97 cannot remember to be honest. My sister was born in 95 though and I think she was still in diapers or a toddler when we got chickenpox. My mom worked in daycare and a friend had it so we had a chickenpox party. Needless to say in highschool I got shingles . Fucking worst week ever. Had a rash right at my bra line. When I went to the doctor to get it checked out all the staff came in to look at it because I was the youngest person they had seen to get shingles. Not sure why we did not get the vaccine because my dad worked for the state and we had very good insurance. shrug
755,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: Oh my gosh I shuddered when I read this
756,Shingles vaccine: Shingles is the worst pain I have ever felt. Epididymitis was the 2nd worst pain.
757,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got it in my eye and face when I was 40. Half my face was all red and bloody from all the pustules breaking. I had so many appointments with the ophthalmologists to ensure I did not go blind. Stabbing random knife pains in my head for two weeks. You do not want Shingles.
759,Shingles after Shingrix: I got shingles on the red side of my face when I was 41 and that is one of the most painful experiences of my life. Thankfully the urgent care doctor who rushed me to the er alerted them that the welts were around my eye. I was in too much pain and was unaware of the danger I was in. I ended up with significant scarring in my eye but the specialists were truly helpful. 6 months later my cvs pharmacist gave me the vaccine the doctors told me that stress being immunocompromised could result in me getting it again so I had to get it as soon as possible.
762,Shingles and other Vaccines: Ugh the Shingrix vaccine was the WORST.
765,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: My dysautonomia was triggered by a vaccine reaction not the shingles one and when I finally saw a vaccine immunologist which took me two years he said I have gotten every vaccine under the sun except the shingles one. He was pretty great and I will probably follow that advice and it seemed relevant to share.
766,Response when asked if HPV vaccine should be taken.: I have had precancerous lesions removed off my cervix due to HPV. So naturally my kids got the Gardasil vaccine because I want them to have the protection I did not have.
767,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the shingles between my ass cheeks. I thought a spider bit me it was so painful.
769,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: As soon as I was qualified. A friend got it on her face and down her throat. She was in so much pain
772,Shingles vaccine?: Many patients including myself will get a sore shoulder  discomfort. Do Not do this without asking your doctor but I advise my patients to take 2 Arthritis Tylenol right away after the shot then repeat this 3 times daily for 35 days. It can help reduce reactions especially flulike syndrome. Again. Ask your doc first as I do not know your meds and medical situation Donald Thomas
773,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: It has been 26 years and because I was nearsighted my vision actually improved with aging. I Am still sunlight sensitive but polarized lenses take care of that. I got shingles a second time on my back but a mild case thank goodness.
780,Pretty long term side effects in ears curious if anyone has also experienced: My ears are ringing for over 1 year since I had the shingles. Its horrible.
783,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My baby got it in December as a stand alone shot and had absolutely no side effects. It does look like a lot of liquid compared to the scheduled shots but I just fed him a bottle while they were injecting and it hardly phased him. If anyone is in or near Arizona Maricopa county Phoenix area gives the shot for free at their immunization clinics. We did it when in town visiting family.
784,Shingles vaccine: I was tired and cranky after both arm ached like someone punched it and I went to bed early and slept in a bit late. Did Not take any time off for either because what are we millennials? YMMV of course
786,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Not the vaccine. I woke up one morning with a burning pain in the outside corner of my eye. It was not even visible but there was no mistaking what was causing it. This would be my second round of shingles. The first case was on my abdomen around the bottom of the right side of my rib cage. I called my GP and was sent immediately to an ophthalmologist. I was prescribed Valtrex and eye drops. My doctor said that if the virus had spread to the optic nerve it can do irreparable damage.
790,Shingles and PHN Experience: Thanks for sharing this. My experience has been similar and I Am almost 2 month in so this gives me hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I tried so hard to avoid gabapentin but its the only thing that is made the pain tolerable. I take 100 mg am 100 in afternoon and 300 at night. It has side effects and is not ideal but has stopped me from being bedridden. My nerve pain is down my arm and sleeping is not easy.
793,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: No issues at all with the first shot. The second shot made me pretty ill for a couple of days. Fever, painful rash on my arm, very tired. Ultimately worth it!"
794,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Yeah that is what he said
796,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Mine hit me the same way. Still better than shingles.
798,My friend got only one covid shot and got shingles which was confirmed by her doctor
799,I have had the flu vaccine once still got the flu I have had the shingles vaccine. I got shingles in my right eye and had headaches and double vision for six weeks. Neither worked.
800,Pediatrician not giving vaccines: My son was going through this as well and got the vaccine and it indeed made it worse.
805,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I was about 44 when I got shingles. It was around my eye but had not involved the optic nerve yet. The combination of the Valtrex for the shingles and tramadol for the pain made me vomit every 45 minutes for a day and a half until I finally got some Phenergan for the vomiting. The Valtrex was 8 a pill and I could not keep it down But the nausea did take my mind off of the pain
807,Got menopause? You may be due for your shingles vaccine: I have had shingles vaccines I would not want to get shingles My mother has them pretty chronically my father had shingles and it was in his spine and partially crippled him. Yeah it is one of the rougher vaccines but I always just get all the shots and then take it easy for a weekend. Totally worth it in my opinion.
809,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You might have just had a break in case. My husband got the shot and still had a breakthrough case.
810,Covid flu and shingles at the same time. Is this how you get the autistic superpowers?: I got the fake fever sweats and had weird dreams but today mostly just feeling achey and slow. I also decided to make today a no adderall day so I have not done much of anything.
811,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Got shingles at 49 two years ago shortly after a Covid infection. Started as shooting pain in my right ear became nerve zaps along that side of my face then the rash looked like acne developed all over the course of 45 days. Got misdiagnosed with ear infection at an urgent care. Finally sent a photo to a friend who is an ENT and he knew exactly what it was. Got on antivirals on day 6. Worst pain I Have ever experienced. Still have rumbling low frequency tinnitus from the nerve damage. And I was lucky not to get palsy or worse. Got vaccinated last year and the vaccine is a DREAM compared the infection.
816,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles at 35 and the pain lasted 8 weeks. It hurt to breathe. I now have permanent nerve damage on my back where the rash was. It is a consistent itch right between my shoulder blades just out of reach.
818,I did a tele health urgent care visit as my dr could not get me in today  so this was diagnosed on photossymptoms not swabs. Is that typical? I started having an awful painsevere itchiness in my tailbone area Saturday night. Did not see anything. Fast forward to Monday night and I had two little blisters on the same side  now I have I think 4 or 5? They are all basically in a little line on one side right under my tailbonegluteal cleft area. Could that really be shingles? I just got my second Xolair dose on Thursday and I did read there was a very low chance of singles developing  but I really did not think anything of it. I am not sure if this location is typical for shingles as I cannot find much about it anywhere and see it more so in other areas. I do not really have the red rash just 4 singular pretty large fluid filled blisters. By the time I can get into my doctor I am not sure if the blisters will even be there to test. I got prescribed antivirals but I have not started them yet  just picked them up late this evening. Anything I should expect as this progresses? Is it possible to get the blisters without much of a rash? It is sort of surprising how much it hurts all the time not just when there is pressure on that area. Otherwise so far I do not really have any other symptoms besides some anxiety about this
822,More evidence of a failing immune system: I know several people who got shingles after taking the Covid19 shots. Maybe more at work we have had a LOT OF SICKNESS and a couple of deaths since people took the shots... But shingles is gross enough people are not going to necessary tell everyone that is what they had. I understand vaccine do not WANT it to be true that the Covid19 vaccines were harmful... But their refusal to admit it is allowing them to hurt MORE people. Just get over it you guys made a bad decision and were tricked. Putting your heads in the sand just allows the people who did this to you to get away with it.
830,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am a gen x did not go to chickenpox party as a kid wish I would of. ended up getting chicken pox around 30 from the vaccine. was somewhat mild but still kicked my butt for the first few days. did get out of work for two weeks though. My job questioned this which is hilarious. Just one of the unfortunate to still get it. I think it is like 1020 get the pox after vaccine. sorry you got shingles. hoping I do not get them before 50.
835,41 and got Shingles: Yes same here I have asthma and covid made my lungs even worse. I would love to be better protected.
836,FML... I got shingles: I got both my kids vaccinated and got the shingles shots a couple years ago and I am nowhere near 70.
838,RSV vaccine?: If you go out or have other children you probably should seriously consider it. I got it for my kid and outside of him crying for 10 seconds that was it. My other kid was vaccine delayed and just got his dtap and chicken pox. So if you want to do delayed scheduling that is an option too for RSV. Its just 1 shot
843,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I got it. Do not know anyone that had shingles but it did not seem like a fun experience and if it is preventable I do not want it. I felt a little run down for a couple of days but nothing too bad and my health insurance paid for it with no issues.
844,Urticaria after Moderna booster: Any vaccine can trigger hives. It was the shingles vaccine for me.
845,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: Got my shot and the booster
846,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me:...and when people used to tell me shingles was bad, I always thought 'yeah, yeah. How bad can it be?'. When I got it, I was in so much pain I would sob, and the pain would knock the wind out of me now and then. It lasted for weeks and weeks and I had to crawl on my hands and knees to feed my cats (I lived alone then). I never ever want to go through that again."
847,The shingles vaccinehelps your body's immune system build up a solid defense against shingles so you may experience temporary side effects after getting the shots. These side effects may include Pain or soreness at the injection site. Redness or swelling at the injection site.
852,Shingles vaccine: I had Bell's Palsey at 17. At 51 my eye still has a small droop that I hate. I definitely do not want to do that again.
853,Shingles vaccine: I got the shingles vaccine and I did not have too much pain in my arm. No more than the flu shot. I did not get shingles. Just remember to get the second shot I almost forgot.
854,41 and got Shingles: Godspeed. I got shingles at 16 on one of my knees. Some of the worst pain that I Have ever experienced. Especially because I got it in an area that bent a lot.
857,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles. It was shit. And then I got the post viral infection thing which lasted like 6 months. That was also shit
858,Was this really a thing?: Yes. And now at 41 I have shingles. I ama get that shingles vaccine soon as I can cuz this sucks.
863,Shingles and GenX: It is for a lot of people. I was ok after my first dose not time for the second dose yet. My grandmother got full on shingles and was laid up solid for three months.
864,Okay Reddit I Am in southern Ontario and right now everything is shut down in the storm. I have an awful cough and sore throat and my breastfed 3 month old has a little dry cough but nothing crazy. She Is had the RSV vaccine thank God and she is exclusively breastfed so I think she is pretty protected from getting much worse but I Am keeping a VERY watchful eye on her. What the heck can I do until I can see the doctor on Tuesday? Any advice? The pharmacist in my hometown was not even able to tell me what is safe to take or do to help myself while breastfeeding i am sure my doctor will recommend a puffer because I Have heard that is the only thing that will not transfer to breastmilk but does anybody else have a suggestion until then?
865,pneumococcal vaccine safe for us?: At the time I had ocular MG only. Shingrex triggered generalised and 9 days later was in ICU with a crisis. I never had shingles
866,I 22F am 17 weeks pregnant rn with a baby boy. My husband has suddenly is having a shingles flare up for the first time ever. I touched it to apply medicine BEFORE we knew what it was and at that time it was just a pink rash with no blistersliquidscabsetc. I am from the US and lived in a college dorm so I believe I was required to have the vaccine but I know I never actually had chicken pox as a kid. Am I going to get it? Can it hurt the baby? I am so freaked out by this especially knowing I applied medicine to it days ago
867,Shingles vaccine: My dad had shingles the last year I lived at home. He was in agony. His entire left side was covered but the worst was on his eyelid. A day or two feeling hungover on the couch is nothing to the weeks of torture shingles can bring.
869,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Ok no mean comments but I cannot do the pneumonia or flu shots due to horrid side effects. I chose not to do covid because of the possibility of the same effects. Does anyone know if the shingles vaccine has any of the same stuff in it as the others?
871,Shingles vaccine: I had no bad reactions to either shot and I am fairly immunocompromised. I will say the shots hurt a bit more than normal otherwise I was fine.
873,Second Shingles Shot: Day 3? Here Is hoping it do not feel like a truck hit me on Tuesday.
875,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had some excruciating shoulder pain so I went to the orthopedic doctor. He gave me a shot in said shoulder which activated you guessed it shingles Went to the urgent care who diagnosed me with the worse case of shingles they would seen after all three providers took a look. I really could not tell the shingles hurt because I was in so much shoulder pain. Luckily I got the medicine which tamped down the shingles. Like someone else said the lingering nerve issues lasted awhile. I was 47.
877,Shingles vaccine: Same Hurt like a mother for 2 days but did not make me miss work or anything. 2nd was actually easier. Still better than actually getting shingles for sure
881,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: Shingles shots stung 2 more than 1. I had little side effects beyond soreness.
884,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember asking my neurologist if he could schedule me for the chickenpox vaccine because I never had it. He did not believe me. I was concerned because I have MS viruses can really eff your nervous system up. And if I caught chickenpox as an adult then shingles it would be a double whammy. So he order a titer to see if I would ever been exposed. He was shocked when it came out negative. I told him my Mom had a healthy respect for viruses her own health. She caught polio when she was 3 or four approximately 34 yrs before the vaccine came out. She got the vaccine as well but she had paralysis of her right shoulder as a result of surviving polio for the rest of her life. I ended up getting both chickenpox shingles vaccines.
885,"Received my flu shot last week and now I have a painful rash on my arm at the injection site. I've been trying to contact my doctor for guidance, but haven't had any luck. The itching is unbearable and I'm not sure what I can do to relieve it. I know skin reactions are common after vaccinations, but I'm feeling lost on how to manage this rash. Any suggestions on how to treat it safely?"
886,'High' 'very high' levels of respiratory virus activity seen in half of states only 47.6 of adults are vaccinated against the flu and 22.3 are vaccinated with the updated COVID vaccine. Additionally just 21.9 of adults over age 60 have received the RSV vaccine: Vaccinated for everything I could be not eligible for RSV. Somehow still wound up with the flu and strep at the same time. Luckily the vaccine helped flu symptoms were much milder than any flu I have ever had.
887,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My former pharmacist said that she was out sick from work for five days from the shingles vaccine.
890,Shingles vaccine: Get it if you can I am 49F and shingles was not even on my radar. Beginning of November I thought i messed up my sciatic nerve and by the end of the week ended up going to Urgent Care for imaging. 2 days later I was in my doctors office with a rash and a shingles diagnosis. The next week was one of the most painful experiences of my life I highly recommend getting the vaccine if you can even after getting it I cannot get a vaccine because of the age rule.
891,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes I remember parents sending their kids to those parties. My parents never did but I did get the chicken pox on day 2 of my first trip to Disneyworld. It was awful I had to stay in our room for most of the trip. Before I developed the rash we went to Epcot on our first day. That was the only experience I had. My sister was there for her band trip and bought me a bunch of souvenirs because she felt so bad that I missed out on so much. Luckily I have not had shingles yet but my dad did. Right by his eye. Incredibly painful and he had to wear what I called old man sunglasses. The giant ones that do not let any light in. I hope I never have to go through that but being that I had chicken pox its a real possibility
892,41 and got Shingles: Yup. I got it early 40s on my faceeye and it was brutal. I had IV pain meds 3 days going home in between in the hospital and I can deal with pain. The pressure behind my eye was insane. Not looking forward to a relapse. It can be very dangerous too
895,Female 30 YO. Currently on Mounjaro 7.5 mg Nortriptyline 25. I take the Nortriptyline for IC and headaches. Looking for a second opinion. For the last 45 days I Have had a sore scalp on the left side a sore throat on the left side ear pain on the left side and an ulcer on the roof of my mouthyou guessed it on the left side. I saw an ENT today who immediately said this sounded like shingles. I have no rash and more importantly I never had chicken pox as a kid I did get the vaccine. My dog had surgery a month ago and I Have barely even been out of the house since Christmas how do I have shingles? Also I Am only 30??? Does this sound like shingles to you guys??
898,I am genuinely scared of covid now.: I have had COVID once. I took paxlovid and was actively sick for like 4 days then slowly started feeling better... Then abruptly crashed and had rebound COVID even worse than the first time for another week. To the point that I do not know if I could do paxlovid again it was so awful. Overall 6 total days with a 102F 38.9C fever. The most energy I had was to lie down with my cat and watch birds out the window. I am worried about finding out later what it is done to my body. I got chickenpox before the vaccine was available so I am worried about shingles and the vaccine is not recommended for my age. On the other hand I work with the public at a library. A lot of people who come hang out in the building sick or bring their sick kids. I have never stopped masking indoors. I only eat at restaurants very rarely if I cannot avoid it. And to my knowledge I have only had COVID once. I wear KN95s. I used to get sick like 34 times a year and have not had a normal cold since before COVID. Our children's staff who mask report not catching every kid bug circulating anymore either. Some people are definitely weird about it and ask what we are so worried about but I just tell them lots of people come to the library while sick and I like not getting sick every season lol. If I am not at work I say I do not make enough money to get long COVID although that is more likely to start an argument. It definitely sucks that other people refuse to mask even when they are actively sick but if I think about that too much I get depressed so.
903,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel better I never had chickenpox as a kid just got vaccinated and I have had shingles twice in adulthood. First time was at 20. Second time was the week I got married. You can still get shingles even if you just got vaccinated and getting chickenpox as an adult is far more dangerous than getting it as a kid. Talk to your GP about it and be aware of the onset symptoms for the future in case you get it again. If you get the meds for it they gave me valacyclovir within so many days of onset it can stop it from getting too bad and clear it up quickly.
905,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I finished the series about 3 months ago at my doctor's advice after contracting a cancer causing strain of HPV and it helped me clear the infection. I would apparently had it for a while according to how developed the lesions on my cervix were. I am not sure how long because it had been a couple years since my last pap smearstd panel. I had the vaccine series and had my cervix frozen during that time. Confirmed with a follow up that I had no traces of HPV left so I consider myself pretty lucky
907,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: My niece got rsv vaccine and spent a week in the hospital at 7 months she just did not get the opp to get it at that point
908,"Question about shingles vaccine...: Who has had it since being diagnosed or are we allowed to have it? I believe it's a live virus, but I've gotten shingles since being diagnosed and it's come back one more time in the last two years since the initial outbreak, however I luckily have meds on hand to stop it before it gets bad. It would be nice to get the vaccine to help prevent future outbreaks..."
910,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles last year it was the worst
911,I m at a crossroads been on Inflect ra for 3 years no flares. Had to stop because it caused drug induced lupus. My joints were all getting sore fatigue shortness of breath. I m 45 now and thought holy crap am I just getting old all the sudden. Long story short I ve been off it for 6 weeks now and some of those symptoms are improving could take a while yet. My Doc wants to put straight on to R in vo q supposed to get a shingles vaccine next week because of it. Starting to feel like it s next drug up mentality. It also has a bunch of side effects. Feels like my best interest aren t really at play here I m not done with the previous drugs side effects how will I be able to differentiate? Okay before I actually turn this into a long story anyone just say forget it I m done with the drugs and try and deal with it through diet and healthy living?
912,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: I got mine in my late 30s as well. Mine was attributed to low immunity. It was a very stressful time and I was having panic attacks. I ended up going on disability for a few months and that helped everything life considerably. I definitely made my parents go and get it after my experience. I would not wish it on anyone.
914,"WHM and persistent viruses: So, the Wim Hof Method has been proven to improve immune function and fight off bacteria, and many people successfully use it to treat chronic inflammatory conditions. But what about chronic viruses? I'm interested to hear about your experiences and if you've heard about people seeing good results from this. For example, are there any reports of people successfully using the method to reduce sickness from hep B? But I'm mostly interested in those lingering HHV viruses that many/most people carry that occasionally reactivate and cause symptoms. Like the Epstein-Barr virus (mono) and V. Zoster (shingles, pox.) And of course, H. Simplex types 1 and 2. Can we achieve such strong and controlled immune systems that we can make our latent viruses asymptomatic and less contagious? What are your experiences and ideas?"
921,Vaccine after shingles?: You can get it right now. Shingrix is a dead vaccine. You do not have to wait the year like you did on the old vaccine they used. I went and got the first shot as soon as my blisters were gone from the last round and before the next ones started. I have active shingles right now and Ill still be there on July 11 to get shot 2. Doctor said it was fine. Honestly if I waited until these things went away I might never get it. This is the 4th time in 4 months.
922,Shingles vaccine: You do not want shingles. Any couple days illness is far worth it. The newer vaccines are not bad. The one from the 90s made me sick two days
923,"Just rolled up my sleeve for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and boy, did I not expect those side effects. Nausea, headache, and fatigue really knocked me off my feet. But you know what? I'd go through it all over again for the convenience of just one shot and the protection it provides. Here's to hoping it keeps me safe for years to come! #JNJStrong #VaccineJourney ????"
926,"Of the 130+ herpes viruses...:... there are 9 known to primarily infect humans: 1 and 2. herpes simplex 1 and 2, 3. varicella zoster (cause chicken pox and shingles), 4. Epstein-Barr (causes infectious mononucleosis and some cancers), 5. human cytomegalovirus (infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands), 6. human herpesvirus 6A and 6B (neurotropic viruses frequently found in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease), 7. human herpesvirus 7 (aka roseola), 8 and 9. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (causes Kaposi's sarcoma) This is really going to date me, but I remember when I was a kid, it was a right of passage to get the chicken pox. If I would've know that type of herpes virus that causes chickenpox stays dormant in my body until I'm old and grey and then comes back to haunt me in the form of shingles, I would've not cared how cool it was to have chickenpox and stayed away. I think nowadays most children are vaccinated against chickenpox so for the younger generation, you won't have to fear developing shingles later on in life like me. I also got mono when I was 19, freshly out of bootcamp, because we all shared our water canteens. Thankfully I never got sick from it. I found out I have HSV2 antibodies for a few years now and I've been lucky to be a not have much symptoms besides that weird tingling sensation. I say all this not to make light of HSV and I might get some backlash for posting this. Most of these herpes viruses are spread the same way, some form of contact either through open sores, sexual contact, salivary gland secretions, childbirth, etc. I think that we have to remove the stigma of HSV within ourselves first before we can with other people. 130+ herpes viruses, 9 of which mostly affects humans. Society doesn't shame if someone has 3-9, but throws stones at 1&2 even though anyone can get 3-9 (mostly) the same way as 1&2. We feel shame only because society shames HSV, not because it's actually shameful. We can stop the effects of shame if we stop feeling bad for ourselves based on others people's judgements. Think"
932,I am almost afraid to tell you that my second dose was the killer. Still neither are as bad as shingles which can last for years. Good luck and know you did the right thing. It is doing its job protecting you.
939,Shingles vaccine: My arm hurt but I did not have any other side effects
940,Vaccines: Really unfortunate to see so many comments saying they are not getting vaccinated herd immunity is a thing and yes you can only get shingles if you have had chicken pox but infection rates of chickenpox have been on the rise due to lower uptake of chickenpox vaccines. As others have said a few vaccines have made me feel cruddy for 12 days but I would much rather that than the actual thing I Am getting vaccinated for. OP I really feel for you. I was in your position in October catching up on the same vaccines before going onto a DMT. I would talk to your neurologist. No one here is qualified to make this call.
941,Second Shingles Shot: I got shingles at like 37. 010 do not recommend. Get the vaccine.
946,TN and shingles vaccine: Perhaps not exactly related but I have wondered about a connection between shingles and TN. I had ocular shingles. The pain was worse than TN. While the pain was around the general eye area and similar to TN it was a little different. I think I have had recurrences of shingles because I have had pain and sometimes a light rash around the general eye are. But it is so similar to TN that I am not sure.
950,"L-lysine: I have struggled with re-occurring shingles. For me it is inside my ear and along a facial nerve. (confirmed by doctor exam and blood test showing active virus) The blisters don't look all that bad but the pain is intense. I've been on (off then back on) Acyclovir then Valcyclovir (at different times). The prescriptions help in the short term but any little thing seems to re-trigger an outbreak. Latest round came right after I let myself have a nice piece of very dark chocolate. So, I'm thinking if food (arginine) can trigger an outbreak shouldn't lysine help keep them at bay? I have tried Lysine before (Now brand) and I don't know if it would have helped or not because I had stomach cramping each time I took it. My question to the community is, has anyone tried a form of Lysine that was easy on the stomach? That might just be a common side effect but I thought I would ask. Thank you,"
952,"Vaccine & late life chickenpox : I'm an adult who managed not to get chickenpox until age 50. It's now been about 14 months since I had the pox, and I think I should get a shingles vaccine. My husband thinks I won't need one for years. I'd like to get it over with. Who's right?"
957,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox as a kid and I got shingles in my 40s. It was not that bad but I have heard it can be really painful. I had a slight rash around my waist.
961,Help Doc started me at 2.0: That is absurd. I bet you feel like shit Its taken me 10 weeks to get to 1mg and I still bfeel horrible the day after the shot.
962,So I have had shingles before 2 years ago on my lower back and it was painful. I woke up this morning to pain on my lower back unable to bend back. The shingles virus left a decent scar there. I have heard that shingles can come back time and time again. Is this true?
963,Mpox.. is shingles.. from side effect of.. convid vaccine
968,Younghealthy shingles experience: I Am 25 and have had it for about 2 weeks now but coming back to normal now luckily definitely came from stress so having two weeks off work to rest was a huge wake up call to take it a bit easier in the future
971,Got my 1st package. Should I wait for the weekend to start?: I could not wait and just did it since I have off tomorrow. Is it normal to feel a slight sensation not super painful but kind of feel the spot on the stomach where I injected it?
974,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I had shingles. You could not get me to get the vaccine fast enough.
975,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine definitely I know people who have had shingles and wow it sucks. But the vaccine for me was like speed running the flu all the classic flu symptoms but really fast. And at the same time this is not real it will not get worse it will not kill me this is just my immune system throwing a tantrum.. So I just had a slow two days one for the fast fake flu and one to feel kind of tired and WTF was that all about.
978,Shingrix makes me feel really bad: Oh man those two shits were the worst. Chills throwing up and horrible vivid nightmares. I haven t gotten singles once in the 2 years I got it tho and used to get it 23 times per year.
980,Shingles vaccine second dose: Second hit worse than the first. However infinitely less painful than shingles so worth it.
981,: I went to a dermatologist a few weeks ago and he was a long time friend of the director of the local hospital who was on life support oxygen getting exhausted after a few steps she got the first doses and like 5 extra shots? She ended up passing mid last year.
985,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I always take a knee too
988,Healing with some ongoing pain normal?: Sounds normal to me. I Am 53. Shingles diagnosed April 5th. Mine affected two dermatomes which I was told is rare and very severe around my left flank from the navel to the spine. The first three weeks were awful. Now at 4 months since diagnosis and I still get shooting electrical shock type pain just to the left of the navel in an area the size of my fist. I Have been told it can take years for the nerve pain to completely subside if ever. Booo.
989,Victory or signs of Over Vestibular Migraine from despair to living: Thanks My wife is dealing with this. She had shingles on her leg in January. Took valtrex. Things went downhill from there. She Is just found an ent and vestibular therapist. Trying to find what prescriptionsupplement to help. Therapist in Seattle thinks her case involves her neck. Your nicely documented approach is appreciated. Any advice is too.
997,First shingles vaccine side effects: I am up to day 5 of having trouble with normal daily activities with no end in sight.
998,Any tips on how to make shingrix less painful?: I was in s tuc ted by a nurse to swing my arm after vaccination to prevent soreness and I have never had any since. Anecdotal but it is work for he p shin gri x covid and a couple of different pneumonia vaccine
999,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 2001. Vaccinated caught it anyway. Later had antibody labs drawn they were low enough to give me no immunity. Got a booster checked titers low. I have had 5 shots total and still have low to no immunity. My doctor is not a fan of this
1003,41 and got Shingles: I had shingles at 28 and it was level 10 pain.
1004,"Under 35 with Shingles?!!!: Same been sick since thanksgiving got a fever over Christmas, 90 days of coughing, sinus infection, then Covid about 2 weeks ago and now this yay... just wondering if the pain gets worse or better. I noticed mine 3 days ago and my brother thought it was poison ivy. On anti viral meds now"
1005,Was supposed to have an appointment to get liver biopsy results and organise starting treatment yesterday. The biopsy did confirm liver mets. Instead I had a phone appointment and them organising antivirals and pregabalin and if I recover ok will start ribociclib and faslodex after the 20th or when I am well enough. I am sore and a bit frustrated by it I have already had the shingrix vaccine due to lupus meds so hopefully it helps with recovery
1006,Shingles vaccine: FWIW my pcp and my rheumatologist were both very adamant that even with the reaction the shot was necessary. Basically no matter how bad I had things for 4 days and even if it had been equally bad for both shots the potential hell with shingles would be way worse.
1010,It was bad. I did not connect my symptoms to the vaccine. Take Tylenol or ibuprofen. Second shot piece of cake. Neither like my mothers severe bout with shingles
1011,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Cannabis was the only thing that took the edge off the pain for me. Also this is anecdotal but my blisters dried up quickly after I tried calamine lotion. It may have been coincidence but that would be my first step if I get it again. Good luck with school. Third year was the easiest for me hopefully you can coast until this is behind you.
1016,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: And the still downvote. It is really scary
1017,Shingles vaccine experience: After watching my husband be on death's door after his first one  I prepared for the worst as well.  It is still better than the shingles after all ..... But then nothing So then I thought. Well maybe the second one is when I get sick nope. Nothing.
1018,Shingles vaccine: My mom got it and still got shingles and her shingles were horrible. My mom was a strong woman and could handle pain well and I Have never seen her react to pain like she did from the shingles pain. It was excruciating and so hard to watch.
1020,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Very likely Stress and a bunch of other things can trigger shingles. My dad ended up having radiation for prostate cancer last year and that triggered it. He ended up with butt shingles the shingles was centred on his butt. They caught it super early since he was going in for radiation daily and the docs know to look for it so he was able to receive the meds that stop it in its track.
1022,Shingles vaccine: As bad as you may feel after the shot its still 1000 times better than actually having Shingles.
1029,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Feeling yucky for a day or two is way better than getting shingles.
1030,I had an absolutely horrific case of shingles in June. I researched getting the vaccine later because this shingles pain was the WORST pain I EVER had. I found many people who get the vaccine wind up triggering another case of shingles. No thanks
1037,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Those silly anti vaccine people. I am a polio survivor and have been crippled since I was four. Lived in an iron lung from 4 until almost six. Separated from my family living in that damn iron lung in a ward full of children who were also living in iron lungs. Some died so at four years old I saw death weekly because weekly a child would die from complications from polio. I also had chickenpox and was so thankful when the chicken pox vaccine came out because I get shingles ever so often until the shingles vaccine came out and yep I took that bitch. I cannot undertand why moms and dads would want their children to be exposed...get diseases that could kill them cripple them or because them to go blind or deaf. WTF.
1041,I was first diagnosed with shingles on 814 after having back pain for almost a week and a rash for several days. My rash has scabbed and fallen off and last Tuesday 93 was the first day I did not feel the need to take any pain killers since my back pain started. I still had the occasional ache but nothing like what I was dealing with before. Now I feel like the pain has flared back up particularly in my shoulder blade where the pain first started. I have read about symptoms not going away for weeksmonthsyears or of shingles coming back later but not a symptom going away for a week and coming back I still have numbness that seems to be going away it went across my chest under my arm and to my back so I do not always notice it and occasional itching that could just be from regular my shirt rubbed my skin in a weird way sort of thing. Has anyone had this sort of experience?
1047,Put me out of my misery.: Shingles sucks I had my outbreak on my chest across my left nipple. I guess there was some nerve damage as I still get pains there. So great... chest pains in my 50's. Honestly the pain is not that bad compared to the exquisite pain of kidney stones. It sucks yes And yeah I 100 agree Take your shots
1048,Shingles and other Vaccines: I got sick from someone else's shingles vaccine. They were having a bad reaction and I had never had chicken pox and so at 62 I got chicken pox from shingles vaccine she would.
1049,Have you noticed an increase or decrease in outbreaks after having covid or shingles? Or after receiving either the covid vaccine or the shingles vaccine? I m 53 f due for the shingles vaccine and considering getting the covid vaccine so I m trying to learn more about the relationship between covid herpes zoster and herpes simplex. I had my first g hsv 2 OB in April 2021 followed by a minor OB in June 2021. Then I had zero OB s until I had another minor one about two weeks after having covid in February 2023.
1050,How do I get over my fear my LO is going to get sick?: My 6 month old just started daycare and got the RSV vaccine at 4 months. She got the flu and bronchiolitis the first week went to ER took a week off daycare and then second week got RSV and bronchiolitis again and is hospitalized right now from it. We had visitors before daycare and she never got sick once.
1052,Dr Scott Jensen MD recently stated that MANY of his patients developed SHINGLES after receiving the Shingles vaccine. Dr Jensen mentioned it because big pharma is advertising something to the effect that you will not get shingles if you get the shingles vaccine.
1055,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: My mom got the shingrix first dose yesterday. She took one paracetamol pill before feeling anything and now today she is back to work. Did Not feel anything side effects according to her. My dad only felt a little off the next day but was also back to work. Reaction to the vaccine really vary.
1056,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: The shots are way better than what my om and younger sister suffered through with months of nasty looking spots and pain and such. A couple of days of slight discomfort is well worth it.
1057,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: That Is not true people under 50 can get the vaccine too. I got it at 28 and the insurance company never questioned it.
1062,I was diagnosed with MGUS in 2007 and have been in the challenging watchful waiting world since then. The only reason why it was found was because I had a very mildly elevated eosinophil count at the time and was sent to an allergist who discovered that I had very high total IgMs. Since then every six months I have an SPEP done and almost every time something new is off. I have gone from having monoclonal gammopathy to polyclonal gammopathy with two restricted bands. Today's results show hypergammaglobulinemia with three restricted bands a possible monoclonal spike and newly a free light chain in the lambda region. While my free light chain ratio is normal my kappalambda ratio on immunofixation is low as is my IgA. My IgMs have always remained high. In the past month I have had a serious COVID infection and a mild case of shingles despite having had the vaccine two months before. My white blood cell count is low and has been for some time. A new finding on the tests I received today is that my LDH lactate dehydrogenase went up 100 points in 6 months and is now at the highest end of normal. Mostly I am posting here because I am tired. I am tired of the watchful waiting. I am tired of my results constantly changing. I am tired of never feeling quite well I have additional health conditions including POTS and vestibular migraine and EhlersDanlos Syndrome. In general I take really good care of myself and like so many of us do not look sick. Additionally as it is been so many years I no longer feel anxious about any of it. I was really happy to find this sub because I am certain so many of you can relate to what I am saying and I am grateful for the direct or indirect support.
1065,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: Doc never mentioned a second. When do I have to get another?
1066,Second Shingles Shot: Other than a sore muscle for a couple of days no issues.
1068,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: Thanks! I also take another anti-depressant (fluoxetine) so I also wonder if that makes a difference. I have tried other preventatives, but not all of them"
1070,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles at 50. IT SUCKS Yes the first one hurts. Yes the second one is worse. Trust me on this better than getting shingles. Get your shingles shot.
1071,"Recurring shingles?: ""They"" say it's uncommon to get reoccurring shingles, but all of these forums suggest it's more common. I am on my second bout in 4 years. I'm sorry I don't really have much advice other than take lysine daily and avoid high arginine foods. They can aggravate the virus. Hang in there."
1072,Humira gave me shingles: Yeah people can develop shingles when their immune systems are suppressed by medications or weakened by other things such as extreme physical exertion or trauma. A friend of mine also a young man in his early thirties developed it while training for an Iron Man triathlon. He was at absolute peak physical fitness at the time but just training too hard. My mother developed it after breaking her arm. So eh it happens. The only ways to prevent are 1 never get chicken pox and 2 get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated against chicken pox as a child prevents it. Getting vaccinated against shingles as an adult prevents it. Unfortunately in the US it is hard to get the shingles vaccine before age 50. My health insurance would not pay for it until I turned 50 even though I take a biologic.
1074,"Help with a rash after some immunizations?: Last Friday, I had some immunizations done. I had the flu shot, the TDap shot, and an MMR and Varicella shot mixed together. Note that I'm 15 and catching up on my overdue immunizations. On Sunday, two days later, a rash formed on both of my forearms. We (my parents and I) thought it might be from the immunizations, so we went to the emergency room to have it checked out. The doctor said it was probably fom something I came in contact with, since the rashes were in a line formation. The doctor didnt put me on a special medication, just to take Benadryl every six hours for the next few days. The rash went away soon after. So I've been taking the Benadryl, but the rash keeps coming back. Tonight (Tuesday) it started forming on my left leg. Is it still forming because I'm waiting too long to take the Benadryl? I'm grateful for any help. Thanks!"
1075,Shingles vac: Hey there. I ve had shingles twice and I m 42. First time was actually right before my first major I BD flare in my 30 s and second time was about two years ago. Neither was TERRIBLE the way it is for some people but it most certainly wasn t good. I did get the shin gri x vaccine before starting remi cade and while I felt yucky for a couple of days it s better than shingles. I d recommend you get the vaccine.
1077,I Am glad you are getting it I was not told to and had severe shingles after my first Rituximab infusion when I was already extremely sick from another drug reaction. Absolute misery on top of misery. Hope the shot does not hit you too hard though
1081,Just curious what to expect. Went to my dr yesterday not feeling well and she said it sounds like shingles I woke up this morning with one spot in the burning area and went back to my dr and she wrote a script for valtrex. I do not have much of a rash and am curious what to expect over the next few weeks as we have travel plans. I do have very uncomfortable and frustrating nerve pain and other feelings of being unwell chills fatigue weakness etc.
1083,FTM 25 weeks pregnant after a miscarriage earlier this year. I received no support from them at the time not even a text. Traumatic high risk pregnancy so far including fetal medicine referrals genetic scares MRIs and tonnes of appointments on top of hyperemesis gravidarum. Due third week of March and in laws want to travel and fit babys birth in around their trips. Have not helped during the pregnancy other than a couple of calls to my partner for general catch ups. Have Not asked if we need anything etc we have covered everything ourselves with my familys support and did not expect contributions however thought they would be excited to buy small gifts like a babygrow considering its their first grandchild. The latest trouble has come from them wanting to book a trip to Sri Lanka a mere 2 weeks before babys due date. I have a weak immune system and a heart condition I battled shingles and covid in the first trimester on top of severe sickness. My partner has been supportive so far and told them he would like them in the country for a couple of weeks before the due date so they can visit with minimal risks however today he has sort of given up and not communicated this again regarding the Sri Lanka trip. I lost it with him this morning as I feel its his duty to tell his parents what we expect and instead I Am now stressing about the risk of an international flight full of germs meeting my newborn baby. I Am at my wits end with it all and feel like telling them to arrange their travels wherever they want and they can see baby when she is 23 months old. Am I being sensitive or is this fair? EDIT MIL has also suggested to my partner I have an elective c section so everyone knows what is what regarding dates and visits. Again I have a heart condition and unstable blood pressure which makes spinals a higher than normal risk and I have not even covered this decision with my own consultant yet.
1085,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Oh yeah I forgot about that phantom pain after. That lasts a long time.
1086,Hi I Have has shingles many times and I recognize the signs so this time I started valaciclovir within 48 hrs. But the pain has been worse than usual. I Have done 6 out of 7 days on valaciclovir and 24 hrs ago one blister formed. Now there are about 20 of them. This has never happened to me before. Has anyone else had blisters form during the last days of treatment? What did you do? Did you get another round of valaciclovir? I am confused and very frustrated by this. I Have been wanting to get the vaccine but I Have heard that a full year needs to pass before you can get it and so far the longest break between flare ups was only 6 months.
1087,: I am fit had medicals twice a year my whole adult life for my sport and always had perfect health 4 weeks after my booster i had a stroke they gave me every test they could think off and could find no reason but now want me to take drugs for blood pressure and platlet production etc etc. We were all blackmailed into having the vaccine or you could not travel work or even socialise whilst drug companies made billions. Never again for me or any of my family.
1088,Should my fiance get RSV vaccine?: I got it at 37 weeks even though I had just gotten over actual RSV. As a pregnant adult RSV was absolutely awful. I was sick for almost a month. I could not imagine my newborn getting it.
1089,Shingles: I had it last October. I caught it early and was able to get on antiviral meds quickly. I was lucky to have a mild case. It felt like bad chaffing which I am used to getting periodically from long distance running and cleared up in about a week.
1090,I made the mistake of getting my second dose of shingles vaccine at the same time as a COVID booster. I do not recommend it. That said the couple of miserable days is nothing compared to having shingles.
1091,RSV after maternal vaccine: My daughter tested positive for RSV last week and I was shocked since I had her vaccinated 3 months ago. But then I remembered the vaccine and me breastfeeding her is keeping her out of the hospital. For that I am thankful. I felt so devastated and terrible but as many others have said the vaccines are not fool proof and they do help
1092,Pharmaceutical Company Asking for Consent to Contact My Doctor: I Am not looking for compensation. I just want my health back as I cannot afford to be ill long term or chronically especially from a shot that I walked in and got myself without being informed about possible side effects.
1094,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Yes I got shingles when I was 42. A bad case. Too early for vaccine to be covered by insurance. PS I did get the vaccines last year they recommend you get them even if you previously had shingles.
1095,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am 34 and got vaccinated when I was young.
1100,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had been in healthcare for 30 years when I got shingles across my abdomen and hips. That is when I finally understood the meaning of the phrase exquisite pain.
1105,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: Thanks for all this. My anxiety is basically the fact that my symptoms now post shingles are mimicking freaking motor neuron diseases like ALS symptom wise which are deadly and I Am freaking out and a part of me wants to trust the doctors but also a part of me thinks the doctors are neglective of my symptoms and they will not confirm things once your symptoms progress to a point where its obvious and then they diagnose you I Am so stressed and scared. I Am just hoping theses symptoms I Am are complications of shingles and not something else more serious. Wish me luck. And hope you feel better too.
1108,Hi Female 28 150lbs. Friday afternoon I noticed this rash on my right hip. Initially it was pretty itchy but I was able to ignore it as the day went on. One thing that stood out about this rash was that it was sore to touch which was noticeable throughout the day but nothing too serious. I figured it would go away if I did not pay it any attention so I left it over the weekend since I was going on vacation. Fast forward to today and the rash has not gone down in size. It is itchy when agitated but the soreness is definitely noticeable especially when I walk. The pain almost feels like I got an I AM injection there. One other thing I noticed is that I now have a hard and moveable lump on my right groin that is also painful to touch. I decided to go to urgent care today because google told me it could be lymphoma but the Dr I saw today said it could be shingles herpes or cellulitis. I Have had both the varicella vaccine and chicken pox and I Have been in a committed relationship for the last 6 years. I also do not recall getting cutbit on my right thigh so I do not know how I would have gotten cellulitis. Ill attach a picture of the rash below but any input is appreciated. Since I Am out of the 72 hour window the Dr said that antivirals would not be helpful so he prescribed me oral antibiotics to take until my swab comes back.
1116,41 and got Shingles: I got it at 19 in college due to stress. It was miserable. The weird thing is that sometimes when I start to get stressed now I feel a little tingle in the same spot. Its like an early warning alert. No idea of there is a physical basis to this or if its purely psychological. Edited to add that I had a very mild case of chicken pox as a child and was told that this was a factor in getting shingles.
1124,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I felt the same way after both. I was fine less than 24 hours later in both cases though.
1125,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: It was the first damn thing I did after I turned 50. Still have not had a mammogram but I got that shingles vaccine. I know too many people that got them and had a horrible time. PS please do not come at me for not having a mammogram. There is zero history of breast cancer in my family.
1126,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus uhh I do not even know you and quit mocking my name She collapsed Me AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA John the Baptist he love the most not you silly
1127,Shingles after Shingrix: I am glad you get where I am coming from haha The lingering weirdness was definitely unexpected especially since I was quick to catch it and recovered relatively quickly. I will look into convincing my doctor to prescribe me Shingrix totally do not mind paying out of pocket and I feel it would be wellworth the cost if it can reduce severity when shingles inevitably returns. Pneumonia is brutal and I am so happy you got the vaccine for it I had it once when I was 21... took 6 months to feel normal again Also doublyhappy you no longer need the medication to suppress your immune system you must feel like a million bucks
1128,Yep. You are imunosuppressed. Ironically the steroids they are giving you for the shingles contribute to lowering your immune system. I got shingles after a cortisone shot. Steroids. I already have a shit system. Mask and hands for all the other nasties. Put mask in your car
1129,Omg. It was awful. Both shots. The second one was worse. The only thing that made me go back for the second shot was seeing seniors who contracted shingles. Very dangerous. My sympathies.
1130,How many of you have had shingles and how many have had the vaccine? My doctor wants me to get the shingles vaccine. I m very pro vaccine but I had shingles already plus I had chicken pox twice as a child. Shingles are hugely painful and even debilitating for many and I m so glad there is a vaccine now. People with MC AS are likely more apt to get them due to their compromised health as well. So this is important. I had shingles well before I knew I had MC AS. I had terrible pain that seemed to go right through my chest and I went to ER thinking I was having a heart attack. Turned out the shingles were in the center of my back but moved all around my left side to between my breasts. Parts of those areas had nerve pain and numbness for years after. I would love to have been vaccinated against this. However sometimes vaccines because me to have several months of flares nothing perm but definitely noticeable. So any ideas on getting the vaccine after we get shingles? Chickenpox is a similar caused be same virus illness and I had it twice as a child pati cula ry bad the second time. Anyone know about this or have similar experience?
1133,How long do I have to wait for shingles vaccine? Those with recurring outbreaks did you get the vaccine?: I had multiple outbreaks over about 25 years before I could get the shot. I was told by my doctor and the pharmacy that the age limits were strict and it did not matter that I had multiple outbreaks. I have had multiple outbreaks since getting the vaccine but they are much milder.
1135,No He really does not have a clue I said they because heart problems be careful I had to say something but damn he already had 3 Moderna plus shingles pneumonia vaccine and said going to get a 2nd part of one
1141,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Got shingles last summer at 38 and it was terrible. I still have sections of skin with nerve damage. Would Not wish it on anyone
1142,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Count your blessings Out of all the shots I Have had this one is by far the worst
1144,Shingles Vaccine: I have had shingles and I really would not recommend it  I had the horrible blistering rash for weeks  the nerve pain persisted for months. I would honestly get the jab if you have been recommended to. I cannot speak to how painful it is but hopefully it would be better than getting shingles
1146,Several reported getting Shingles not long after receiving COVID vaccination......
1148,Shingles vaccine experience: My dad had lived actively through a life filled with physical problemsincluding cancer surgery and losing a finger and I never heard him complain. He Would just suck it up and go on. Shingles brought him to his knees. He could not sit or lay down they spread to his face. He begged me to make the doctors do something for the pain. I Have had both kinds of the shots. One was shingrix and the other one was a long time ago some M name I think. Id never want to go through what my dad went through.
1151,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Hubby got it at 47. He does not complain about anything but at 2am he looked at me and said we need to go to the ER. The rash was small on his rib and shingles was the last thing we thought. Absolutely miserable. The joke was after he was done with the antiviral they said he was too young for the vaccine.
1152,Not completely true I was jabbed with small pox vaccine being 4 now 69. At 24 I developed Herpes Zoster they called an Old Person's disease and ever since suffered from very painful PostHerpetic Attacks 96 of those jabbed with this particular vaccine has dormant Herpes Zoster
1154,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I have had shinglestwice.also have been vaccinated and the vaccine kicks your ass. Both cases of shingles were brought on by a stressful situation. Get vaccinated BEFORE you get shingles would be my advice.
1155,Shingles vaccine experience: I did not have any reactions to shingles vaccine either
1156,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Salt water rinse. Extra sleep. It was not as bad as the blisters you get on your skin. That said I could not eat much. Had to go with soft food.
1157,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: I m so sorry you re going through this. My understanding is that can definitely happen but it s quite unlikely. How are your stress levels?
1158,Shingles vaccine: Round 1 yesterday. Last night was the most painful night of my life. Holy crap. Just could not find a position that did not hurt. Add in fever cold sweat and a lovely headache and you have got a nice little party.
1159,1 month old sleeping all day after RSV shot?: Thanks for the reply I will check her temp on the next feed. So far her head does not feel hot but I will keep an eye on her temp. The injection spot looks fine although I think she is allergic to latex like I am because she still has slight marks from the bandaid like I get. So good to know for the future lol.
1161,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I got it when I started Rinvoq but i am in my early 30s. It was absolutely fine other than my arm being sore as fuck for a couple days. My uncle essentially died of shingles complications after suffering for a couple years and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. Only reason they give it to the elderly is because their immune systems are weak and so are ours.
1162,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I did. My husband who is a few years older than me did not. He just got over it maybe a week ago. Yeah it was pretty bad. At least he went to the dr and got an antiviral. . though I am not sure how much good it did for him. The nerve pain was pretty intense as was the skin sensitivity. It was difficult to watch so I cannot imagine how difficult it was to have
1163,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Another milestone reached. Are you also up on your colonoscopy? I got my first one at 50 and I Am in the 10 year club. Re vaccine sideeffects the first one did not bother me so much but the second one laid me out. Good luck man.
1170,I know this subreddit is not a replacement for medical advice. I just want the opinions of other parents My 9 month old has been sick the last two days. Really stuffyrunny nose trouble sleeping. A little bit of wheezing and she is been coughing but not regularlyseems to be caused by congestion. BMs have also been pretty runny mucusy compared to the regular. She Is been eating fine drinking water bottles normally and still very happy playful energetic. Steamy air Tylenol sucking her mucus plenty of fluids cold air have helped her. The thing is I Am terrified of RSV. She Is been vaccinated she does not seem to be in bad shape. I know its most likely a cold but I heard RSV can get really bad really fast. I am also becoming sick myself with a stuffy nose sore throat white spots on tonsils which I read could be rsv? We are between insurance companies right now. Id hate to panic and take her to the doctor and pay 300 just to be told its just a cold. Should I trust my gut that this is just a normal cold or is it better to be safe than sorry?
1172,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: i have shingles on my face and neck right now. i feel the same way. i also had it in 2020 and i could not get out of the bed i was so tired and exhausted.
1173,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Had a bad case of shingles 6 years ago. So I jumped at the chance to get the vaccine had mild symptoms on the first shot and believe you me it is nothing compared to shingles.
1174,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Holy shit that fall was rough
1180,This is the 3rd most painful thing I have ever experienced and only the 3rd because I had cancer at 27 and that brought on nerve pain and the second most painful types of headaches behind migraines. Got gabapentin valtrex and prednisone yesterday and about a week into start of symptoms. I have it all around my under arm and chest and back. Calamine is not helping for more than a minute but I am keeping at it to try to dry it out quickly I guess. CBD has been a godsend but I had to lower my dose because of the 300mg 3X a day dose I hoy of gaba. I have cried 2X because of the pain. Which is once more than I ever did during chemo.
1185,Shingrix: Agreed. I got the shingrix vaccine before I started biologics and still got a mild case of shingles. It was terrrrrrible and my case was extremely mild.
1188,I am M32 from the Philippines Southeast Asia. I had a peasized swollen lymph node this last June 2024 that lasted for 3 days. I remember staying up late before that. I then slept then when I woke up that is when I noticed my left armpit was aching and I had that size and it is also red. A general physician doctor recommended me a sultamicillin antibiotic for it and the lymph node subsided. After that the pain or aching comes and go and it was mild until it came back a few days later. A few days before that I had experienced intense stress and anxiety due to being angry at some family members. The stress was so intense that I felt my left armpit being in pain again to the point that it radiated down to my chestmanboobs and almost to the nipple. The right side alse started to ache and both sides are onoff. I also began having back pain that started in the middle where the feeling is like someone is pointing a pen on it that it is slowly spreading. Right now my back feels hot and also my neck but it does not feel like feverish that a thermometer can read it. I also have sore throat and think I have swollen tonsils since October after eating an ice cream. I went to two ENT doctors that said nothing major about them despite seeing tonsil stones on my left side. Both also did not want me to take antibiotics maybe because I might become immune to them eventually. One doctor mentioned about contrast due to his findings and prescribed me with a throat spray as treatment. Early December I went to the second doctor saying that my tonsils are like swollen but it is level 1 for him. He took out my tonsil stones and advised me to monitor my throat if I feel any fever dizziness and any other symptoms relating to it that needs to be checked to him again soon. I mentioned to them about some lesions found below my tonsils and before going down my throat but they still did not comment about any of it. One on the left is round and whitelike and the right is pimplelike. I notice that it is been there since October. I have onoff sore sensation since and sometimes it feels like something is stuck on my throat or that it is a bit of a choking or pushing feeling on one side I think? A while ago I went to a general physician to this clinic I have been visiting since April. Most of the doctors there are general physicians and unfortunately there the doctors are shuffling based on their schedules so the one I have been seeing there is unavailable today he was the one that gave me sultamicillin. The doctor a while ago also did not recommend me to take antibiotics for now and also apologized to me that she is unable to help me a lot and that she is more on the field of psychology. Though she then prescribed me to do blood work and also recommended a psychologist for my stress and anxiety to which I told her I just went to one but may transfer to another due to my schedule difficulties. I will take my blood works or blood tests soon as prescribed by this general physician. Just a while ago I was browsing reddit and saw this that kind of scared me because I felt similar symptoms as indicated there. I am not sure about my case but like what is indicated there I feel slight feverhot body esp in the back although thermometer today does not indicate that it is rising stuck at 36.4C no night sweats though the last time I had night sweats was in January or February itchiness at the back but it is fast and there are no rashes or even hives also experiencing onoff fatigue even without swollen and painful lymph node since last year December 2023 also to add joint pain not exactly testicular swelling but the part connecting the scrotum and groin as well as my upper groin near upper parts of pubic hair on left and sometimes right part feel like swelling or sore but no bumps I also feel this similar swelling or soreness right now at the back of my ear and almost going down my neck this also happened since early 2024 when I feel stressed again and I do not feel any obvious swelling bumps on both sides no difficulty in swallowing and blood stools and I also do feel slight onoff tenderness on my left part of abdomen and sometimes on the right both below ribs. The comment of the physician redditor was so specific that it scares me a bit today. I would also like to add that I took Gardasil 9 vaccine this April June and October. I do not know if they have anything to do with it. Though I had unprotected oral sexual encounter with someone in April before I had the vaccine. I am not even sure if the encounter also had something to do with my tonsil and lesions situations. I also have joint pain with fatigue sometimes later on that is still undiagnosed and I assume I may have fibromyalgia symptoms or rheumatoid arthritis. Like after I move my body like doing errands or go outdoors I get tired and those are what I feel later on even muscle stiffness. Again about my question what could I possibly have given these symptoms and other findings and what else should I do next? I will add more details if I can recall some more things to add or any updates about my case. Sorry for the repost.
1194,"Our roof is shot, double shingled, 22 years old. We've been in our house 1 year and said we wouldn't do anything to it until after the year. My husband wants to redo our roof next year to a metal roof.: No experience and amateur. Lots of determination and willing to learn. We don't know anyone who installs roofs. We live in a really harsh desert environment with short lifespans on roofs. I'm on board and I believe he can do it. But where to look for info and doing it properly? What are the ways to make this happen?"
1195,Shingles vaccine experience: My dad was vaccine He DIED from shingles when it crossed into his brain. Get the shot everyone. All the shots.
1197,I just thought I would share my recent experience with shingles even though I was vaccinated almost a year ago. I did not expect to get it needless to say so when I noticed about two weeks ago that I had some red welts on my neck I assumed it was some kind of contact dermatitis. I did not think too much about it but woke up in the morning with blisters forming over the welts and I realized it might be shingles even though I had no pain or itching. The doctor was skeptical at first because I have been vaccinated but after conferring with his colleague they determined that it was in fact shingles. I went on Valtrex on day 2 and by day 4 the blisters were completely gone with no scabs in their place just some dry skin where they had been. The red rash lasted another 2 days and it disappeared as well. I never had any pain and it never spread beyond the initial rash on the side of my neck. I had no residual effects at all. I just share this to say that it is worth it to get Shingrix if you can. I think this would have been much worse had I not been vaccinated.
1198,Its the effects of the covid vaccine that is giving people the shingles
1201,"Thought it was heat rash lol: Your friend can go to a local pharmacy for vaccines. I don't believe there's an age requirement for shingrex, but I'd give it a try. Any human who has had chickenpox can get shingles, no matter what age."
1203,I have had every covid vaccine available in april2023 I had covid vaccine RSV and shingles vaccine on the same day and was sick for months also the public in general is sauntering around like the pandemic is over it is not because sarscov2 is eternal nobody in media cares
1204,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Got the first dose second to come in January My FIL got it in his eye and he spent 6 weeks in agony. It got so bad we were trying to get him to try marijuana to ease the pain and none of us smoke. He almost lost his eye but he got lucky.
1206,Hi all I got diagnosed less than a month ago after visiting the ER for double vision and started treatment with Ty s a bri last Wednesday while I get vaccinated for pneumonia and T BE and will after that be moved over to Mab the raR it ux an. I would like to ask if any of you who do not have antibodies to chicken pox have gotten the shingles vaccine Shin gri x? My doctor says that the hospitals immunologist have recommend it and that it might give some kind of protection against chicken pox. Went to get vaccinated with Shin gri x today and the nurse questioned why that was even prescribed as it is not known if and how much protection it gives and asked me to collect some more data on this before deciding to do it or not as the vaccination is about 250 per dose and not part of any vaccine program in Sweden.
1209,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Both. I was in a study at Bethesda Naval Hospital and was given three rounds of zoster over a two year period. The logic was due to me having an autoimmune disease. It cut down on the disease severity. The following year zoster shot went on the market. So my claim to fame is I helped eradicate chicken pox a bit. I got shingles maybe two years ago but only in one spot. I am almost 40 and adamantly Pro vaccine
1214,Shingles vaccine: My wife and I both got the Shingles vaccine because we know many people that had shingles after 50 years old. My grandfather and grandmother had it as well. After what they went through I swore to do anything I could to not come down with it. Side effects were minor. Its basically a small headache and at the worst some minor chills.
1217,Seeking Personal Experiences with Varicella and Shingrix Vaccines Impact on HSV2HSV1 Outbreaks: Please stay away from the vaccine. It made mine worst. 16 months of hell. My outbreaks starting calming down in October of last year. My last outbreak was in October.
1218,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine I was a little tired. You do not want shingles.
1220,"Myocarditis after three years?: I spent the week of Christmas hospitalized after having chest pain, heart pain, and passing out with elevated troponin. I was diagnosed with myocarditis. I had covid in August of 2020 (and have no idea if I've had it since, but tested negative at the hospital). I have systemic lupus, but never had organ involvement (18 years). I had awful tachycardia after covid that lasted for months and developed a bundle block at that time. Anyone else develop myocarditis so long after covid/advice?"
1222,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: For both shots it felt like someone had punched me really hard in my arm for a couple of days but that is all. I did not feel achy or sick.
1223,Rinvoq and Shingles: Came to say Rinvoq does because you to be a high risk for Shingles. They should have asked you to be vaccinated prior to commencing. If no one has warned you stay away from babies and anyone who has not had chicken pox or the chicken pox vaccine. Contact with the fluid from the Shingles blisters can transmit Chicken pox which can be very dangerous for babies and the elderly. The antivirals need to be started within 3 days of the infection starting in order to be fully effective. I suggest getting access to pain meds to help with the pain. Depending on where your outbreak is will depend on what other treatments will help. If it is on your face near your eye 100 get your eye checked as soon as possible as Shingles can damage your eyes very badly and because blindness. You will need to wait for it to subside and clear before you can get immunised. But speaking from experience the Shingrix vaccine can be given after you have already had Shingles. I had Shingles repeatedly for 12months and have not had it again since I was fully vaccinated. Rinvoq is my final option for treating my rheumatoid arthritis and my doctor is still unsure if it is worth the risk of Shingles. I had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which is Shingles in the ear and facial nerve that caused facial palsy. 4 years on and I still cannot move one side of my face fully and will never smile on that side again. I also have permanent nerve pain and damage to my eye. So I speak from experience when I say get the vaccine. I hope you heal quickly and never get Shingles again. It truly is a cruel illness.
1229,That Was It??: This is so true I did my 4th shot today with no pain The first 3 felt kind of like a bee sting. I alternate thigh shots maybe next week I will try my belly.
1235,Recurring shingles?: First of all so sorry you are going through this it sucks I am 37 M and have had shingles 17 times since my first bout at 22. I have had the vaccine. A headache and severe fatigue is usually one of my worst symptoms when an outbreak is coming on. Hang in there I hope you feel better soon
1238,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: Oh my goodness I Am so sorry The pain must be unimaginable. I got shingles 7 days ago. Brutal pain I hope you recover soon.
1241,"Just got my first dose of the HPV vaccine and my arm is sore! It's not as bad as the flu shot, but definitely feeling it. Looking forward to seeing how my body reacts over the next few days. #VaccinesWork #StayProtected"
1246,Rash? Bumps? Shingles? What is this?: No I did not have chicken pox as a child I have the vaccine but from what my mom told me I have a reaction to the vaccine. If that has anything to do with it
1247,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes I Am familiar. We did not call them that but it was a common thing among the aunts to call each other let them know you could come expose your kids to theirs at right ages etc. I am over 50 and immune compromised and just started the two part vaccine shingrix. I believe if you speak to a pharmacist you wait a certain amount of time with no outbreak there may still be a benefit to getting the vaccine postshingles just ask maybe it can lessen severity or frequency of future symptoms.
1252,Anyone Under 50 got their shingles vaccine: My wife who is on the border of GenX had an outbreak of shingles with the first COVID vaccine but our family doc still will not let her get the shingles vaccine as she is only 42.
1253,I had no reaction to shingles vaccine. Nor tetanus flu COVID nothing. My skin is so sensitive I cannot wear a watch but vaccines bother me not at all. FullyVaccinated VaccinesSaveLives
1257,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: I have been dealing with the worst eczema I ever had in the past year too right after I got covid. Got shingles yesterday and am wondering if it has sth to do with Covid and Covid vaccines too......
1260,Dealing w people's remarks on unhealthy food: Wow I am so sorry you are dealing with all of that Unfortunately I can understand aggravating POTS or dysautonomia alone can mess your GI all up never mind if there are other issues I also have migraines with aura mental health stuff I feel like most chonically ill people are dealing with something in one way or another getting tested for sleep apnea seems to be genetic and not due to weight since my brother and father also have it and are also a healthy weight Crohn's disease complete dissacharide deficiencies major malabsorption issues endometriosis and PCOS some cardiac stuff osteoporosis was on budesonide waaaaay too long I have had shingles twice now so my immune system is shot asthma from getting bronchitis and pneumonia so many times from being on immunosuppressants nonbleeding ulcers I had a GJ tube until May 2023 they removed it because the tube had disintegrated and was causing stomach wall erosion and I was maintain my weight until my recent shingles outbreak and now I am losing weight drastically...I REALLY DO NOT WANT BACK ON THE TUBE trust me you have no idea how awful it is until you have one...they are incredibly painful extremely cumbersome disgusting messy the number of times I have woken up in formula because my tubes disconnected in my sleep and the flushes are SOOOO uncomfortable and my bowels do not enjoy them I have learned to use hand warmers for my IV bags when I do have my tube and insulating the tube so the formula and flush are not so cold going in that also mess up your bowels I would have major fluctuations between constipation and diarrhea especially during a flush kidney stones bladder issues vitiligo minor from my Crohns disease and some other skin issues that seem to be related similarly with my joints and eye sight...IIRC aside from my liver and pancreas the only other good organs I have are the ones I do not need like my appendix super chill ALL THE TIME but my tonsils were raging until I got them out at 15 lol. Oh did I mention I am only 34 . Honestly every time I enter the doctor's office I leave with at least one new diagnosis this time was sleep apnea and the dissacharide deficiencies but he got the deficiencies because he is a new doctor and I brought him my medical reports from the last 6 years and he ACTUALLY READ every page with me during my appointment and found my duodenum biopsy where they had tested for this and finally told me and explained what it meant...like THANK YOU Finally feeling seen by a doctor for once. I have just gotten used to my body failing me and do everything I can to try and either prevent or slow it down I am still wearing a mask out in public places because I have not caught COVID yet studies have shown it exacerbates GI diseases so I really cannot get it and my doctors had me on a strict isolation for 2 years. But even then I have not been sick in 4 years. Not a cold not a flu nothing. And I used to catch EVERYTHING. My best friend has 5 kids and unfortunately every time I would visit I would have whatever was going around within 48 hours. I could hear someone coughing and again sick within 48 hours and I am a religious handwasher. Honestly these masks are AMAZING and I do not foresee stopping using them because it is SO nice not to be sick all of the time I am not a mask pusher live and let live is my way of life I am just speaking for myself because I was just sick all the damn time and was so over it. It is just awesome to be able to go over to my friends now I have moved back home after my symptoms worsened and am looking at a career switch that hopefully will be more flexible and can be done remote I have my PhD in neuroscience so I NEVER intended on more school...but after getting sick I am far less reliable timewise I do not know if I will be feeling well enough to do benchwork or how much time I can dedicate to it. So I am looking at pivoting into computer programmingsoftware development with a focus on security and understanding the impact of AI since I was in the medical sector for over 16 years and am familiar with hospitals pharma companies academic institutions funding agencies all areas that will most likely not incorporate AI into their software due to their need for confidentialilty...I am hoping that turns out because honestly trying to find a secure stable job nowadays especially dealing with multiple disabilities is next to impossible. And I do not want to be on disability my whole life I worked too hard to not be able to enjoy life the way I wanted to and now that I have accepted I will not be able to have kids my service dogs are my children now traveling is my next major priority I actually went skydiving no I did not ask my doctors for permission LOL and omg it was the most amazing thing I have ever done So now I am addicted and want to become a digital nomad rent AirBnBs for a month at a time in different countries and just enjoy what the world has to offer in ways I can experience it my goals are to do major wonders of the world like the Egyptian Pyramids and Great Wall of China. Since my health broke down dealing with the isolation of COVID no longer being able to do my job and moving back home to go on disability...it is actually really nice to feel like I have dreams again and things to look forward to. These diseases can take SOOOO much from you it is important to find the things it has not and you can enjoy. Yes Having friends who understand your position and are accepting are crucial My best friend of 20 years is also a nurse MS and a few of her sisters she is 1 of 9 kids are either nurses or nurse practitioners and they all understand my illness and never question my food choices. I went to their annual pig roast this year and I could only eat a few small portions of a some items and even that made them happy because at least I could enjoy some of the food and did not just have to watch everyone else eat but they would NEVER push me to eat I have gone to brunches and they do not even ask if I am eating they know if I do not bring it up then I cannot. Honestly I am so lucky to have such accepting and understanding friends . Omg yes TMJD can be very bad my one sister has it and required surgery for it and from my animal work it is extremely easy to burst and eardrum this my be TMI but there is a facial vein that is typically used to collect blood and even the slightest wrong placement and a small poke with a needle not deep just to because bleeding can rupture an eardrum which I am shocked is not brought up in school more often since that seems like a pretty important detail and I like my hearing thank you. I hope that it did not fully rupture and that you are still able to hear Sorry I can also ramble on like crazy my mornings are typically me watching my dogs in the backyard with my coffee and bong in Canada lol and it is my favourite time because I feel better my mornings are my tough period so the cannabis helps so much and can then chat forever hahahaha I hope you are doing well and that they are able to find a diet that helps you maintain your weight because the tubes definitely suck and I do not recommend if there is ANY way to avoid them. All the best
1261,Shingles vaccine experience: I had a little soreness after both but no adverse reaction. Get the second shot
1263,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My sisters and I all got it at the same time. We were our own pox party. In retrospect I feel bad for my youngest sister she was not even two years old yet. Then she got juvenile singles at 14. I am now severely immune compromised and got vaccine for shingles as well as a lot of other things they typically do not vaccine people my age for.
1266,"Talk to your doctor before taking the HPV vaccine.: Hey friends, I recently got the HPV vaccine (Moderna) and unexpectedly developed a low-grade fever a week after the vaccination. Initially, I attributed it to a minor cold, but when the fever persisted, I decided to reach out to my healthcare provider. After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that my body was mounting an immune response to the vaccine. I came across these articles that discuss similar reactions to the HPV vaccine: [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) If you have concerns about potential side effects or are unsure about getting the HPV vaccine, please consult with your healthcare provider beforehand. Your health should always come first. Despite my experience, I remain an advocate for vaccination and urge everyone to prioritize their health by getting vaccinated after consulting with a medical professional. Stay informed and stay healthy!"
1269,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My grandmother has had shingles multiple times and even from the outside it seems terrible. The most recent time before the blisters came through the way she was reporting the pain I thought she was having a heart attack and I took her to the ER.
1281,What vaccines were you offered before starting a bcell depleter?: My neuro at Mayo who diagnosed me recommended COVID and flu but assumed my local neuro would have taken the lead on it. They did not care but the oncologist I worked with recommended at least shingles and PNA. Got my first shingles before treatment this fall. Then COVID booster between my first loading doses. Then second shingles bruuuuuutal and PNA a couple weeks apart leading up to my first full dose this March. I Am 29.
1283,Shingles Vaccine: One of my close friends got shingles last year we are 35 ALL over her whole body. Giant welts rashes and scabs everywhere. she is had 2 kids with unmedicated births and said the shingles pain was way worse than childbirth for her and it lasted quite some time. Still has some scars from it. I would get the vaccine.
1284,Shingles vaccine experience: Had my second dose about 2 weeks ago. Zero side effects. Even the sore.arm was not as bad as the first shot
1287,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got off exceedingly lucky here. My mom had the good sense to get me vaccinated soon after it was approved. That was 1996 for me. Never had the pox.
1288,Shingles invited itself to my travel: Don t waste your time. I got shingles from the chicken pox vaccine. The chicken pox vaccine is supposed to prevent chicken pox shingles. The vaccine has the virus which lays dormant in your system and can be activated under stressful situations. They say you can only get shingles if you previously had chicken pox and I never had chicken pox.
1289,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: They do not warn that the second shot flattens you.
1292,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Glad to know. Hit me pre40 and was BRUTAL. Hilariously I spent the first week wondering what all the fuss was aboutthen the second week happened. It will bring you to your knees is an instant.
1293,Shingles vaccine: I had a sore arm both times. That was all. All I knew is that I had the chicken pox bad when I was a kid so I knew shingles would be horrific and I was not going to have any of that.
1296,I am switching from Ozempic to Zepbound and am wondering about others' experiences and strategy. TLDR Lifelong fat guy. Middleaged exhausted dad. Gained and lost lots of weight multiple times. Ozempic 14 months 8 loss with LOOOONG stall lowresponder? Ozempic was free no longer now have to pay out of pocket for Zepbound A bit disheartened and wondering efficacy of tirzepatide vs semaglutide in your experiences about the logisticstiming of switching costeffectiveness is it really worth it to pay OOP as a lowresponder? Some background Lifelong fat guy currently 42m 73 326lbs battled it my whole life. Lost and gained significant weight multiple times. In the first year of my career at age 25 my weight got up to 385 and I buckled down and started lifting with varying degrees of cardio and dieting in that I was paying attention to what I was eating with various degrees of restriction macronutrient approaches consistently and kept it up for 14 years. During that time I mostly cruised around between 300 and 315 carrying a lot of muscle and being wholly able to do what I wanted to do physically keep up on hikes do manual labor generally not be in pain or hampered by my body. Blood markers were good through all of this only issue being slight hypertension that resolved when I eventually got on a CPAP in recent years. During a brief phase in 201617 I got superobsessive about diet training for mountaineering did an utterly excessive amount of training like 3 hoursday between weights and cardio 7 daysweek and significant caloric restriction largely through long IF windows like 204 and weekly extended 44 hour fasts and dropped from a strongbutdecidedlydoughy 350 down to a lean veiny 225 in 15 months. After the expedition up the mountain passed I kept it up for a while but never really figured out a way to dismount from such an extreme period and coupled with external stressors weight slowly started going back on. Fast forward to late 2019 early 2020 my wife is pregnant with our first child I am in the second year with the boss from hell there is otherwise massive turmoil at my work and with all that and everything else in the world I am super stressed out trying to keep it together and be the rock for my growing family but just cannot make myself work out as much or keep as much dietary discipline. I end up gaining back up to right around 340 when my kid is born in February of 2020 where I am then homebound with a newborn and then largely stuck at home without access to a gym due to the COVID closures and generally sleepdeprived and more stressed than I have ever been and selfmedicating with alcohol and weight rapidly goes up to 400 by August 2020. I was the outlier that ballooned the average of everyone is COVID gain. Thereafter my sleep apnea got really bad ended up going on a CPAP started experiencing a significant amount of pain in my knees feet and hips had vascular issues in both legs requiring surgery and generally ended up in a body that was not up for the job of what my life required. This was not a healthy fat. Starting semaglutide Not wanting to exist as a fluffy mound of pain from mid2020 through late 2022 I slowly assembled a home gym a huge battle between the COVIDrun on gym equipment our small house and the timedemands of raising a young child with two working parents and zero external assistance. In the summer of 2022 I started lifting again consistently and dieting as best I could. It was a trip trying to figure out how to onramp back on because I would been so strong and relatively fit before. I would lost significant weight before and seen firsthand just how differently BETTER people treat you when you are not fat. I felt deeply ashamed of my weight gain and fighting back through it all and trying to make a change but also forgive myself was emotionally exhausting. Anyway that is kind of beside the point. It was an emotional mindfuck and massive struggle but I whiteknuckled it back down to 355 by November 2022. Around then I figured out that my insurance would cover semaglutide and talked to my doctor about giving it a try. They put in a PA and I ended up getting approved and 100 covered for Ozempic did not cover Wegovy for some reason. I was on Ozempic quickly moving up to fulldose and between December 2022 and March 2023 lost another 25 lbs. Then I had a decidedly shitty few months where I got COVID first time and then shingles a month later a few weeks without childcare because of COVID along with some decidedly crazy shit in my town ever skipped an outdoor workout because a serial killer is on the loose? and my training took a hit. In the summer I got regular again and have been ever since but basically my weight between March of 2023 and February 2024 largely stayed between 345 and 330. Currently it is at 326. Coming off Ozempic Results November 22 355 March 2024 326 looks like an 8 loss even with the best attempts I can make at diet and exercise with my current work and family situations. I have previously lost 35 of my weight 350 225 with just training diet willpower alone. Obviously I cannot go to those same extremes again it would end in divorce and a feral child but 8 in comparison seems disappointing. BUT Ozempic was not costing me anything my insurance was covering it 100. Then this year my insurance stopped covering my Ozempic. I took my last injection a week ago. I had a dry spell around November '23 when I was not able to get it filled and I DEFINITELY felt the hunger coming back even if I would never seen much weight change. My doctor put in a PA for Zepbound and it was denied but I decided I would at least try it with the 550 coupon but I am a little concerned about the long haul. x200B To Recap Lifelong fat guy. Middleaged exhausted dad. Gained and lost lots of weight multiple times. Ozempic 14 months 8 loss with LOOOONG stall lowresponder? Ozempic was free no longer now have to pay out of pocket for Zepbound My questions Of those of you who have switched from semaglutide to tirzepatide Did any of you see improved response on tirzepatide compared to semaglutide? How did you handle the transition IE how much time did you wait between last fulldose shot of semaglutide and first onramp dose of tirzepatide? Am I just wasting a stupid amount of money for how little impact these medications seem to be having on me? Paying 550month just to be a littlelessfat just seems utterly cursed. My current plan Waiting until about three weeks from the last Ozempic dose to possibly start Zepbound want to see what it feels like with it largely out of my system and see how I do without can I handle the hunger can I keep the weight stable or improving without? Take my four onramp doses and see how I feelif it has any noticeable impact compared to my time off meds. Reassess from there and decide if this is really worth 550 outofpocket
1301,Any parents get the RSV vaccine for their baby yet? on: My 7 month old got a fever for a bit and was fussy at bed time but woke up perfectly normal.
1302,Put me out of my misery.: Still better than having shingles I had them in my early 40s and thought my face and jaw was going to explode. Lesions along my jaw and inside my mouth for weeks. Thankfully my dentist who I got an emergency appointment with because I thought my molar was infected diagnosed me and sent me to urgent care. I got the shots as soon as I was eligible
1304,What Is your visitor plans? RSV season newborns: I am due early January and I am dead set on visitors having tdap and the flu vaccine I got a nasty reaction to tdap when i got it back in 2012 so bad that I swore I would not get it again. But guess what I got it a few weeks ago for the baby. And I still got a bad reaction. I also got the RSV which was not fun either. If I can go through that so can anyone who wants to visit the baby. I am not too worried about my side of the family as we are not new to the baby scene but this is the first baby in my bf's immediate family. I told him he needs to make sure his side of the fam is on board and that they get theirs done with enough time for them to build up immunity. Definitely no kissing the baby either. And must come willing to help around the house to earn baby visiting time
1305,"Tysabri Infusion & Shingles: Hi, looking for advice. I just received my Tysabri Infusion on Wednesday; this is my 20th and I am feeling pretty bad running low grade fevers with headaches around the clock. Now this morning I woke up with itching and pain on my left ribcage, it is shingles and steadily worsening with shooting pains and has traveled around my back. I have not received the vaccine. I'm concerned about PML. The box warning is to call neurologist immediately. Any advice or recommendations are truly appreciated. Thank you."
1310,Shingles vaccine uptake dramatically increased after Inflation Reduction Act removes patient outofpocket cost shingles vaccinations covered by Part D rose by 46.: just a reminder you can get the shingles vaccine at age 50 in the US. I do not know about other states but in mine you do not need a prescription just make the appointment with your pharmacy. one of the few good things about getting older is getting my shingles vaccine so i am not one of the 13 of people who get it. I have hear too many horror stories from people who got it to delay. better a sore arm and being tired for a couple days even yearly flu shots drain my already limited energy than potential agony that can last months
1312,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: We had pox parties for this reason and I was patient 0 in the area. A women my mom worked with had the pox shortly after we had it and ended up in the hospital for a week
1315,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Doctors were unable to diagnose an underlying condition and the fainting spell was not tied to vaccination.???? How do they know it was not tied to vaccines if they were UNABLE to diagnose an underlying condition?
1316,Shingles vaccine: I received Shingles vaccine 1st dose and 2nd 6 months later. No problems or side effects. Received booster shots for Covid that is now referred to as annual Covid shot with annual flu shot and have never had a side effect. A couple of times I had a soar arm for a day but I would speak to your doctor and weigh the health benefits because at our age. Good luck.
1319,Rash under arms?: I had the same problem but a little lower down the arm and 8 days later it was confirmed as shingles.
1320,Shingles Vaccine insurance?: My son in USA got his covered by insurance. Only instance where USA did better than Japan
1321,My coworker came into work sick this week. Everyone told him to go home. Our boss is very accommodating and he has a job that can easily be done at home if he did not want to not work even though he has unlimited sick time. He kept saying I am just tired despite him telling everyone his baby has been sick for two weeks and stayed the whole day. Fast forward to the end of the week and I am now sick. My husband woke me up in the middle of the night because I was coughing in my sleep and it sounded like I was struggling to breathe. We were supposed to attend an infant cpr class today and now we have to miss that. I am scheduled for my RSV vaccine and were supposed to start our birthing classes on Monday. I am going to be livid if I have to miss those. I am annoyed with people who do not think about how their actions impact others. that is it. that is the rant. Have a great weekend.
1326,Shingles vaccine experience: I got shingles for the first time at 31 I am 35 and have had them roughly ten times since then. I have permanent neuropathy and scars. I have been told it is not fda approved for my age and that I should not be getting recurring shingles but here we are. Edit 21 not 31

1328,Is this your first or second shot? Whew boy the second one was a doooooozy. But it is got to be way better than getting shingles
1330,Shingles vaccine experience: My provider wouldn t let me get the first C covid vaccine until two weeks had passed since the second Shingles shot.
1335,Shingles vaccine: Get it. My husband got shingles at age 36 from stress. It was 2 weeks of acute pain and then 3 months of tingling numbness and nerve irritation in the spot where his main sores were. It was truly horrible and I dread the day it happens to me.
1339,Got vaccine today: I got both shingles vaccines about 2 years ago and got shingles 8 days ago. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. Best of luck that you never have it again.
1341,20F detailing my experience and asking questions that have been bothering me. i had no clue it would be shingles. i always had an itch on my left foot which i believed to be a fungal infection and under my left thigh dry skin. first week of august i scratched the rash on my foot too much and it scarred. the second week i was outside of the house every day so it was stressful for my foot i had to put bandaids on so it did not have to hurt much. at this time the rash under my left thigh was bearable still. it just got itchy especially when my skin is sweating from my commute. it was only the fourth week of august that it got so bad for both. fluid got to the fabric of my skirt and i still thought it was sweat then but i checked and noticed the blisters under my left thigh. i got a cold and a fever that same week. so at august 30 i went to the hospital and was diagnosed with shingles. very tired of it and depressed about it. it is painful and burning and when i move i feel like my skin is getting stretched and it hurts so bad. i get so stressed when i have to shower especially that i have to clean it. glad my mom takes care of me. both scars are still leaking after two weeks. last friday i had a followup. the doctor still wrote herpes zoster on my medical certificate after showing them more blisters on the other parts of the body such as on my back i have got back acne on my chest usually red patches appear after hot showers and stress maybe? during normal days more itchy small blisters on my arms. i am worried that maybe it is not shingles anymore because it is not only on one side of the body. matter of fact the first day of my checkup i also showed them the blisters on my hands. they got worse now like lots of blisters on my left thumb and right middle finger itchy. plus i have got blisters under my right knee which i noticed i got from sweating as well. almost forgot to mention at 1st week of september blisters appeared on my lips i have moisturized so much that it is in a better state now. at the same time small dry patches of skin appeared on my face and i have got tiny bumps not blisters and not as itchy as other stuff i have got going on. i have had this on my face for one week now. so my question is can the virus reactivate and have blisters appear like this all over the body? i keep researching about this and i have still got no idea. or is it possible i have got multiple skin conditions like Dyshidrotic Eczema to explain the hands and under my knee but I do not know with my chest and back at once which is what I am thinking and actually worsens my stress and anxiety. although most of them has dried up it is still very itchy. how long do i have to deal with this? also has shingles affected your sleep? aside from the itch i cannot find a proper sleeping position due to the rash. i avoid letting it touch the mattress despite the gauze because the contact is uncomfortable and i am afraid to irritate it further. now i have got lower back pain and am sleep deprived. how are your experiences with sleeping? have any tips? i hope this was not wordy or incoherent english is not my first language. PS i am a college student and asked for excused absence for two weeks to rest. but i still got asynchronous activities to do i hope i can handle it.
1344,celebrex  Shingrix and other vaccines: When I got my shingles vaccines no one mentioned anything about antiinflammatories. The shingles vaccines is a wonder I got shingles during Covid just before my vaccine was scheduled and it SUCKED. Here is what one medical expert suggests You should not take antiinflammatory medications like naproxen ibuprofen or aspirin before you get a vaccine simply to try to avoid side effects. There is some thought that doing so could slightly blunt your immune response to the vaccine. However if you take these medications regularly for other conditions you should continue to do so or if you develop pain or fever after getting a vaccine you can certainly take pain relievers to ease your discomfort.
1345,"""Consult your healthcare provider before getting the Covid vaccine."" I received the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) a month ago and recently experienced swelling and redness at the injection site. At first, I thought it was a normal reaction, but the symptoms worsened over the next few days. After consulting my doctor, it was determined that I developed cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. I have started treatment and am on the path to recovery. Upon researching further, I came across some articles that shed light on similar reactions after COVID vaccination: [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) If you have a history of skin infections or are prone to allergic reactions, it is crucial to discuss these risks with your healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine. Remember, your health comes first. **Would I still opt for the vaccine knowing this? Absolutely.** Please prioritize your health and make informed decisions in consultation with your healthcare provider. Edits: Added relevant sources"
1349,I had a milder reaction to Shingrix than I did to Moderna. And the 2nd S was milder than the first.
1355,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: I was lucky to have no side effects from the first. We will see about the 2nd.
1357,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I Do Not Know how someone could NOT see the connection from topic to topic. Its like saying oh you did not say this specifically in a conversation so you must not have meant that. When it just flows in a normal conversation. The post was talking about rsv and experience. I commented an experience someone got the shot then went to the ER. That Is pretty clear that the shot caused a reaction that led to the ER
1363,: Please will someone address whether those who chose the Johnson and Johnson avoiding the mRNA platform should be worried. My husband had a stroke in Nov 21 and 90 of his corotid was blocked. He took Pfizer They claimed no further blockage in his system. Somehow I do not believe them.
1364,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My brother in law got shingles at age 24 because of extreme stress from his older brothers unexpected death in a plane crash. At 51 he still has scarring on his forehead and side of his eye. Hes so lucky it did not affect his eyesight.
1366,I had absolutely no reaction to the shingles vaccine. Everybodys different.
1368,Shingles shot: It was the worst shots I received. Sure a lot better than getting shingles. Thanks mom and dad for sending me over to Mikeys house to play. I did not even like him that much. A week later chicken pox appeared.
1370,Glad I brought a book: The cdc should lower the age recommendations to 30. I occasionally have shingles flare up during periods of high stress or if I Have been recently ill. I had my first outbreak of shingles at age 37. I Am 39 now. A little over 10 years till I can get the vaccine. Thankfully I Have had enough episodes now I can recognize when a flair is coming on My joints get achy my face gets hot then I start finding the vesicles on one side of my body and along my hair line. Thankfully its not as bad as the first few times. I will get the shingrix vaccine the day I turn 50. My step mil also said she has shingles flairs as well but was adamant about no vaccines of any kind. Okay then you insufferable idiot. I Hope you pray well when you get sick from preventable diseases.
1372,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yeah Id much rather have a few day of feeling crummy than a case of full blown shingles
1376,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: I never had obvious signs of having Chicken pox as a child when my brother had them. FF to a month ago when I developed Shingles vaccinate vaccinated unvaccinated. Dr said it s possible that I had a symptomatic Chicken pox as a child.
1378,RSV vaccine for infants.: Our baby got it at her 2 week check up was not a big deal
1380,Shingles vaccination: In 2019 I was in residency under a lot of stress and reactivated into my meninges and had varicella meningitis it was a nightmare. I was 30 years old. I asked for a rx for the shingrix vaccine because it was not a good enough excuse for me to wait to see if it reactivates into my meninges again when shingrix is such an amazing vaccine. I paid nothing out of pocket and insurance covered everything even if I would have had to pay thousands out of pocket I would do it. I am not immunocompromised. I would consider this a case by case basis with shared decision making could not imagine someone telling me to not get it because of my age or if insurance might not cover it.
1385,Getting my first Shingles shot today: My first shot was fine. The second one was similar to a Covid or Flu shot. I always schedule my vaccines on Fridays too.
1386,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Chicken pox can be so much more dangerous than people realize. My SO had it so bad they ended up in the burn unit at the hospital. I am so happy grandma got shingles I hope she is in chronic pain for the rest of her life.
1388,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: She was interviewing prolificly after she recovered and felt that it was from her vaccinations. Unequivocally
1391,Shingles vaccine experience: I had no reaction at all to the vaccine and after watching my dad and motherinlaw go through shingles easy decision for me. They both said it was the most painful thing they would ever experienced.
1393,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had both an icepick headache and I think what OP is describing. Mine started as what felt like a normal tension headache for the first day and a half until suddenly I started getting an icepick headache. Very scary very painful stabbing. Tingles started. Typical shingles blistering started. Headache went away. A few weeks later I got the electric shocks.
1395,"Myocarditis- anyone have anything work?: I have just ended up back in the hospital with myocarditis after four months of it. I'm three years post COVID and one year past the moderna vaccine. COVID gave me vestibular migraines triggered by extreme food sensitivities, histamine intolerance/poss MCAS, bf, cfs, etc. I had a bad reaction to the booster shot and now have neuropathy in my face/cheeks. I had a re-activation of shingles this summer. I had a heart biopsy done and they found hydoxychloroquine toxicity (I have lupus and have been on it for years with no issues). But now my rheumatologist doesn't believe the HCQ tox accounts for the myocarditis inflammation. I suspect the spike protein and don't know what to do. What treatments have helped other people with myocarditis? My heart symptoms and the inflammation are worsening despite being on increased prednisone."
1397,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Either that or the shingles weakened her substantially enough that it made it easy for the Covid to get the job done.
1401,My best friend was buried Friday. Failing transplanted kidney which should have lasted another 10 years shingles brain bleed caused stroke uncontrollable bp issues. She was 56. This all happened in the past 10 months. She got at least 2 Covid jabs plus shingles vaccine since 2021
1402,31 yr old male: Oh wow Yikes That looks awful. Your first picture looked like mine when the rash appeared. It did spread probably because I scratched it. Read in another post that the person did not scratch so the rash was relatively small. Oh well live and learn. There seems to be no consensus among medical professionals as the root because of shingles flare ups. My doctor said stress causes flares up but at the time 7 weeks ago I truly was not stressed at all. I would say your best bet is to exercise daily eat healthy and manage your stress levels.
1403,Shingles vaccine: I never got the vaccine. I actually got shingles. I was so miserable. It hurt and was super itchy. However you are screwed if you scratch because it hurt and burned. Even if you get sick from the vaccine I recommend getting it. The actual disease is sooooooo much worse
1405,Shingles vaccine question: Both mine were one day of feeling lousy.
1406,41 and got Shingles: Got a shingles like virus when I was 37 think. Was in my throat ear face. Caused bell's paulsey. Half my throat was paralyzed could not swallow damn near aspirated a handful of times causing vomiting. I sounded like Bale Batman when I spoke loud enough to be heard. It was a tough couple of months. Had a ringingwhoosh sound in my ear for two years hearing my blood pump. Sounded like a window was cracked open constantly.
1407,Hi alljust wanted to share my experience with the RSV vaccine for anyone on the fence about getting it. I got the shot at 33 weeks to get ready for my November baby. This was my second pregnancy I have a 3 yo in daycare. My oldest had RSV at 16 months and has been asthmatic ever since. Safe to say I do NOT want my newborn getting this thing. My big fear came true two weeks ago when my son came home with flu symptoms and a fever of 103.5F. Fever did not go away after a few days so we had him swabbedRSV positive. My husband and I both got sick within a few days. Baby did not get sick AT ALL. No congestion no fever nothing. He was 8 weeks old at the time. What a miracle. I am so grateful that I was able to protect my child this way. If you are pregnant and meet criteria definitely consider getting this shot Especially if you have older kids at home. RSV is mostly just a cold for adults but it can be lethal for babies
1410,"Shingles: Hi, shingles is just awful, especially with what you are going through. I can't speak to your treatment and the vaccine, but I can tell you that Shingrix is a two dose vaccine with the second dose to occur within 2-6 months after the first dose. It is supposed to be effective for 10 years, so no annual vaccination. The side effects can be pretty significant (but much better than getting a shingles recurrence), but you should really speak to your doctor about what you should do Sending gentle hugs because shingles is awful! xx"
1411,30F shingles on the face: I Am so sorry. I Am 60F and I got Shingles the 3rd week of March. It went on forever. My pain was excruciating 1010. My shingles were on my scalp forehead eyebrow and eyelid. My primary doctor referred me to a dermatologist because she thought my case was severe. She also made sure that my ophthalmologist cleared my retina. Thankfully my retina was fine but my ophthalmologist said that Shingles can be very serious to the eye. I do not know how you do not spread it. I would try to wash your hands frequently and try not to touch your eyes. My pain lasted until Day 15 and then on Day 16 the most miserable itching began. The itching was horrific. My doctor prescribed hydroxyzine pill for my itching. It does make you sleepy but it helps a lot. In my worst itching I took a 2pm pill and a bedtime pill. Currently I Am still on a hydroxyzine pill at bedtime along with now only 100 mg gabapentin helps with any pain. My dermatologist also prescribed some comforting ointments which helped. Cortizone 10 Eczema also helped along with ice packs. Also Aspercream spray was very comforting to my skin. I tried calamine lotion and it helped a lot until it dried up my forehead.and it then became uncomfortable to use. You will sleep and sleep and sleep. I could not stop sleeping. If you have any questions please text me on here. The Reddit people saved me during this nightmare. Please take care. Shingles is the most miserable thing I Have ever been throughworse than 2 Csections and colon surgery. Get Well Soon Hope this helps
1413,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine and I am not 50. My mom got it earlier than 50 and I told the clinic so and they said fine
1416,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am Gen X. I got vaccinated . I get the pox party idea though.
1417,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Had a bad case of shingles 6 years ago. So I jumped at the chance to get the vax, had mild symptoms on the first shot, and believe you me, it is nothing compared to shingles."
1419,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: We were super lucky to be able to get our hands on one. Pediatrician offered at his first appointment and I said hell freaking yes. My brother in law a pediatrician could not even get one for their new baby. Needless to say baby has been in daycare for two months. Multiple RSV outbreaks and he just has a snotty nose. Happy as a clam. I also felt much more comfortable bringing him into grocery stores out and about around others because I felt he already had a little protection.
1421,Do Not you mean shingles as a result of the mRNa gene therapy shot
1422,Pediatricians are pushing this now at the behest of pharmaceutical companies. My adult son grandchilds uncle got DTaP booster when his niece was born at brothers request and came down wShingles within days. This is not uncommon.
1424,Shingles vaccine: I am 47 I have had shingles twice already. I was told I am too young for the shot? They would not give it to me. The first time I had it I also had vertigo I was down for about a month. It was terrible.
1425,Shingles vaccine experience: Everybody's different. My second dose was easier than the first.
1427,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: We got whatever vaccines were offered at the hospital and then baby got their RSV at their first pediatrician appointment. It was not available everywhere yet so we got lucky that our office had it
1428,My 13 month old son stays in daycare during weekdays and started in March when he turned four months old. Since September he is getting sick more and more often. He had RSV on 91324 he had RSV vaccine in February before starting daycare. One week later he had hand foot mouth disease the second time on 92024 the first time of hand foot mouth disease on 51625. He then started coughing and wheezing on and off for almost a month. Almost every other week he ran fever and started wheezing. He ran high fever at 103F on 12624 with no cough. It turned out to be an ear infection. Last week right before Christmas he started drooling copiously and had blisters around his mouth and all over his hands and legs. I thought he got the hand foot mouth disease for the third time. It turned out to be impetigo. And today when he finally got better daycare staff turned him down even with the pediatricians note to clear him because he is still scratching. So he will have to stay home for four more days. So my question is this normal for him to get sick so often?
1429,ON got my RSV vaccine: I had no reaction to mine
1430,I have been taking high doses of LArginine and LCitrulline together each morning for the last several months I am in excellent shape but recently developed a very bad case of shingles out of nowhere I previously had chicken pox as a child. I went to the ER and the doctors said it could be triggered by stress but I was not in an especially stressful time. The pain was excruciating the rash covered half of my abdomen and went around my side and to my back. I was prescribed an antiviral and gabapentin and spent the next three days miserable in bed. I joined thershinglessubreddit and happened to see many posts regarding LArginine possibly triggering the shingles. Search for yourself. I wish I would have gotten the shingles vaccine. It is healing but t's been three weeks and I am still in pain 247.
1437,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Thankfully I did not have a problem with the antiviral medicine. I think they helped because I caught it early. The pain medicine helped a bit. Then again any of the codeine based stuff usually knocks me out. The biggest problem was that it was also on my face and scalp so when that side of my head would hit the pillow the pain hit worse.
1439,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never caught it but we waited for the longest time to get the vaccine just to see if I would contract it. By the time I got the vaccine I guess it had died off enough it was not among the general public. So now I am vaccinated. I swear though I wish we had coxsackie virus hand foot and mouth vaccine here I never caught that as a kid either but I caught it last year and gawsh that was miserable
1440,Shingles on my face and scalp: I am sorry you are going through this. I also had shingles on the forehead scalp and eye. It was awful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my experience. Echoing what others said see an ophthalmologist and even if they clear you do a followup in a week or 2 that is sort of my opinion as a patient not a doctor but I think the risks to your eye are too great to not do the followup. See them AS SOON AS POSSIBLE if you notice changes or things worsen. I had shingles in December 2023 and still see an ophthalmologist due to lingering inflammation. I did lose some vision. My headache was intense too. Mine actually started with a headache so I ended up at the ER when it was getting worse and otc pain relievers were not helping. My headache lasted a week. That is when my eye issues really started. Eventually in addition to the eye stuff I had nerve pain that was like brief electric shocks. Painful but bearable because they were so short. It seems everyone is a little different so do not expect my experience to be your experience necessarily even though they seem to be on the same nerve.
1441,I had no problem with the shingles vaccine which I got after two friends horror stories of having yearlong painful shingles. Recently shocked to be diagnosed with shingles myself but some itchy spots that scabbed in 5 days was it because Id had the vaccine. So grateful.
1442,41 and got Shingles: Oh yeah I have had it 3 times. I am 43. The first time was on my face and I thought it was a cold sore then it went up and in my nose and the doctor freaked. I was on anti viral medicine for like 3 months.
1443,"Question: Bleeding after 2nd shingles vaccine and medication changes.: Vaccines cause an immune response. For women, that response can include changing periods schedules, breakthru bleeding, longer or shorter bleed times. The COVID shot did this to a lot of women, and though we talked about it with each other, there was very little mentioned in the media about it. Talk to your Dr if it's concerning."
1446,My daughter contracted vaccine related shingles 23 because she was vaccinated for chickenpox at eight years old. As a single parent I was forced to have her vaccinated or they were going to withhold her from school. That Is what I was told. Lots of stories like this on the web.
1447,Remote Viewing woke the Shingles virusmaybe: My TF coach got shingles during her ego death after kundalini awakening it is not unheard of. Energetic changes biological changes.
1451,Put me out of my misery.: Thanks for your response. Your comment definitely convinced me to seek treatment. Even if it is not shingles you and other posters here convinced me to get the vaccine as well. Not a vaccine denier but I cannot say I was not hesitant about temporary negative effects from post vaccine immune activationantibody build up. It is been hit or miss with other vaccinations. Immune activation antibody build up is weird. Sometimes I feel nothing sometimes I am knocked out for a good while. This was the kick in the ass I needed. Thanks again
1454,Rinvoq concerns: I Have been on Rinvoq 45mg going on three weeks and I Am starting to see some small improvement and thankfully no bad side effects besides fatigue and headaches. Also got the shingles vaccine prior Stay positive
1455,I recently had my second shingles shot. No reaction.
1458,Pregnancy vaccines: I got them all as well Tdap flu Covid and RSV. Felt fine after all of them and really happy I took the extra step to protect me and baby 
1459,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: I Have had the vaccine. No side effects just a small pinch at the injection site.
1462,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Yeah it is surreal. Luckily it is not itchy but it does feel like a deeper nerve pain or muscular not unlike getting a solid kick in the ribs and boy does it hurt. Never really felt anything like it before.
1463,Shingles vaccine: I cannot get the Shingles vaccine for 4 more years. I had shingles when I was 43. I did not even know it was a risk for folks under 50. It was suggested that I try and see if I can get it early but so far it is been a no. I am getting it as soon as I can. I never want to go through that experience ever again. I promise you if you get shingles and are not vaccinated you will be so mad at yourself. Even if the vaccine were not to completely prevent it having milder symptoms would make it worth it. I got it on my face and in my mouth. I thought it was a chemical burn because I had just started using prescription retinA on my face. My dentist did not recognize shingles and referred me for a root canal because of the pain in my molar. The emergency room doctor took my suggestion that it was a chemical burn from retinA that must have gotten into my mouth while I was sleeping at face value and did not pursue it any further. He prescribed me a lidocaine oral rinse and told me to take ibuprofen because he was not prescribing anything stronger and I was in serious pain. The lidocaine rinse only worked for 2030 minutes and I had to wait hours between uses. It was not until a few days later after I missed the deadline for taking the antivirals when they would be effective that I went to minor med because the pain was increasing new numbness and the burns seemed to be getting worse. I explained about the retinA while I was with the checkin nurse but when the nurse practitioner walked into the room it only took one glance at me for her to be certain I had shingles. The only thing she had to ask is if any of it was also on the left side it was all on the right side. It came really close to my eye so I am very lucky it missed it. I then went to my dermatologist who gave me topicals to help with the pain. Three weeks of misery. After the pain went away it was at least a month before the numbness completely lifted. I was thankful for that because some people go years with numbness. I still have a scar on the side of my chin from one of the blisters. I did not pick at it or anything...just what it left me. Oh and I canceled my root canal appointment because the pain in my molar went away when the shingles resolved. I have since learned I can get shingles more than once. It is especially common if you have a weakened immune system or are under a lot of stress it was Covid times...I do not remember not being stressed. My motherinlaw had it during her first pregnancy when she was in her early 20's. And her sister had it early in life during a volatile divorce. My dermatologist told me she had contracted it twice and she is my age. It was easily one of the worst experiences of my life. At least with kidney stones they gave me strong pain meds and could do something about it surgically. I had epidurals for the delivery of both my sons. But doctors did very little to help with the pain during shingles and I was feeling it 247 for weeks. It hurt to eat and drink. It was difficult to sleep. I thought I was going to lose my mind. Fortunately I now know it has a very distinct sensory aura.. prickly like stinging nettles or very fine cactus needles against the skin. I will never mistake it for something else and will be able to get on antivirals immediately if it ever happens again.
1464,Shingles vaccine: Had my 1st shot just yesterday and feeling fine. My arm is a tiny bit sore but that is it. I also was prepared for the shingles vaccine to kick my butt so pleasantly surprised that I have no side effects.
1469,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: What if you never had chicken pox but suddenly developed shingles? Does that mean someone had the virus and it could it be dormant in system? My boyfriend never had chikpox then got shingles suddenly under a period of extreme stress when he was 25. The doctor said the stress triggered the sudden rash and said it could have been dormant but who knows. He is ok now but it took a long time to get better. He said his skin felt like it was on fire. he had to use calamine in addition to a steroid cream and it still took 3 weeks. But he never had chicken pox and had not been around anyone with it at the time.
1472,I may have had my shingles vaccine too early after treatment.: I think OP is talking about regular vaccines after chemo rather than after transplant. I am in the middle of that myself postallo. I have had some skin GVHD so my tacro taper has dragged on. They finally said I could get my flu and Covid vaccine Both hurt more than usual. I think of that as a good thingmy body reacting. ' You definitely want to get the shingles vaccine I got it right after starting a treatment about a year ago. I still have permanent effects. A small percentage of people have motor neuron effectsnot just sensory neuron effects. For me that meant almost no feeling in half of my foot. No one ever said shingles could be like polio. Get vaccine for it as soon as you can.
1478,Shingles vaccine: I Am a genx pharmacist. I do not recommend getting it right before you planneed to be functional. Get it on a Friday and have the weekend to ride it out if you have the usual blah reaction or worse. Its likely to happen plan accordingly . Still better than ever having shingles.
1485,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: agreed I am into week four now and can only last a few hours before needing to sleep.
1488,Shingles vaccine experience: My second dose was a breeze. Also in general drink lots of water and move your arm around during the whole day after you get any vaccine.
1493,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I got Covid for the first and only knock wood time in April 2023. Its been bad since then. I Am in line waiting to see doctors but there is just zero sense of urgency.
1494,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep. Happened to me as well.
1495,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was 10 when I caught it at church back in the early 90s. I was miserable for a solid two weeks. I do not remember the itching but I do remember the pain. I had gotten the sores in all my mucous membranes down my throat in my nose in my nether regions etc. I was pissed when a vaccine came out a few years later.
1500,Shingles at 35: Man this makes me feel so fortunate that when I went to a walk in the doctor diagnosed me immediately. I did not even consider how bad it could have been if they did not recognize the symptoms. They really did not help me with the pain though. It was a solid 8 for the first week. I eventually found that ibuprofen worked amazingly for the lingering pain. Just FYI in case you are still dealing with any pain.
1506,I got shingles in m3: Got mono TWICE. Did Not even know that could happen
1507,How did Fibro begin for you?: Gosh I can't imagine being born in pain... I had about 14/16 years of pain free living until my RA started. I also think it's so interesting and sad to hear how everyone's fibro started. So many injuries and accidents and doctors who say it's all in our heads...
1511,Shingles vaccine: No issues this year with Covid vaccine or Shingrix beyond sore arm. I schedule for vaccines for midday Friday just in case.
1512,Which vaccines to get: Oh good to know Thanks for sharing My husband just had shingles and it was awful.
1514,At what dose did you start experiencing negative side effects?: I Am on 7.5 and my only side effects are slight fatigue the day after the shot and slight constipation if I do not stay on top of fiber. Not everyone gets extreme side effects but that is what more posts here will be about because you do not really need to post if nothing is happening you need help with. GL
1515,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: I got shingles at 37 and then got the vaccine. It was miserable but not as bad as the shingles themselves but most people need a prescription for the vaccine if you are under 60 and they will not write unless you get it. That Is American healthcare for you.
1516,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: Yes that happened to my middle child who got Shingles at 27.
1518,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Shingles SUCKED ASS They should redo that vaccine for 30 plus at least. I had it at 42 on Thanksgiving. I was in agony.it almost made it to my damn ear
1525,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: A relative got Shingles and it damaged her optic nerve. Just got my second Shin gri x at the VA last week
1527,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I too got sent to a chickenpox sleepover as a kid. I then got shingles at 23 years old while I was deployed overseas. It was a terrible experience. Even months after it the blisters were gone the bone deep achepain caused me to go see specialists because I was convinced I must have some sort of bone cancer. Nope just post herpatic neuralgia. That was 13 years ago and I still cannot stand to have the origin spot touched by even the lightest hand. what they do not tell you about is the lingering effects. If you get dehydrated or overheat the pain comes back In fact last month I had a higher than usual stressful week. The shingles pain came back in full force starting at my left shoulder blade where it meets the spine and shooting down my entire left arm. Apparently this is called silent shingles where the pain is present but the blisters are not. Thank God my kids got the vaccine and will never have shingles. I would not wish this on anyone.
1530,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: Yeah they need to lower the age requirement. I know a nurse who got it in her 30s and teacher in his 40s. They both looked wrecked. Did you get the bumps on your face and mouth? That looked hellishly painful
1534,A woman I know said her daughter had a terrible reaction to the vaccine and had 6 months of medical intervention to rectify period problems and then went on to urge people to get latest shingles jab.
1536,Shingles vaccine: 36 hours of feeling like ass seems like a small price to pay. I guess knowing that people should just go get it done on a Friday afternoon or something. Stock up the fridge. Or have someone who can bring them something to eat or drink.
1540,RSV vaccine?: My LO got it a few weeks ago. Had 0 side effects and was completely normal. Only cried for a split second. Id rather her get the shot than be on a ventilator in the hospital She Is also had all vaccine but the rotavirus due to immunocompromised people in family and it being a live virus
1543,"How did Fibro begin for you?: I left an unsafe relationship, my therapist suggests that because I wasn't listening to my gut my body took over to tell me something was wrong. I also have hyper-extension in my joints so I think it's a combination of trauma and my dodgy joints"
1549,Shingles: I developed shingles at the end of a cycle last December It did not catch my attention as anything significant until the day after retrieval. My day 3 6 embryo report was much worse than other cycles and was likely related. Even if you were allowed to proceed your results may be compromised anyway. I Am so sorry. I know how frustrating setbacks are. Edited to add I was too late catching mine to start anti viral meds and even then mine scabbed over and healed within 10 days. Hopefully yours heal fast like mine did and you would be able to start back as soon as possible
1553,Oh it burns and stings. I got mine at kroger and imminently bought a bag of frozen peas to use as an ice pack. The rsv vaccine stings too but not as badly as the shingles shot
1557,Shingles vaccine: I must live under a rock because I had not heard about the shingles vaccine until i got shingles at 44. A also thought it was poison oak at first because I am an outdoor person and because when i get the poison oak rash I get it really bad. So I did not go to the doctor for about a week. Then i got on the antibiotic just as my wife left on her longawaited girls vacay and I had all five kids for a week. Apparently mine was on the mild side but I have got a scar on my hip from it. My doctor said he would had it three times including once overseas in a rainforest during covid. The body ache was the worst part. Before I knew what it was I almost bought a new mattress. Now I guess i have to wait a while before I can get the shots but I am definitely going to avoid getting it again. My uncle got it so bad that it got into his eye and he lost some vision from it.
1561,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: That 2nd shot will floor you. I was dumb doing this on a friday and losing my weekend basically.
1565,Shingles shot: I was never vaccinated at a child so I got the vaccine when I was 28 or so. I got the chickenpox from the vaccine it was not too bad for chickenpox. So I was expecting to have a reaction but the 1st shot was a doozy.
1567,Shingles vaccine: 36 hours of feeling like shit  then fine
1568,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Because from the research I have done the more times you have the vaccination the less effective it is Otherwise I would agree with you. I got shingles in my mid 30 s and it was a whole barrel of no fun even with antivirals and codeine to take the edge off.
1570,Shingles vaccine experience: Honesty I do not understand the attitudes toward vaccines today. I am a heart transplant recipient my recovery was pretty rough and I was on higher doses of the pretty toxic anti rejection meds for a longer period than most. End result was kidney failure which means I have to do dialysis. I Am medication induced diabetic and use a bipap. I am alive and enjoy my existence. All that has happened every single doctor I see tells me to get vaccinated. They worked practical miracles on me to get me where I am. After all that I Am supposed to pay attention to what Joe Rogan and politicians about vaccines instead. Absolute lunacy
1571,Shingles vaccine: The Covid shot was awful for me but the shingles did nothing. My father has been suffering with intense nerve damage for 2 years because he did not get the vaccine. Please go get it.
1572,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I ran to the docs to get it. I do not care how painful the shot is. My Brother in law got it and it was the grossest thing ever. Ill take the shot please
1575,Boy the shingles vaccine is rough for 2448 hours but you know what is much worseactually having shingles.
1579,Shingles vaccine: Cranky tired went to bed early so just like any other day
1580,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: For all of in the 50 ish year range be sure to encourage your parents as well. It is possible that they got a shot years ago when it was just one dose. Her doctor encouraged her to get it again due to how long it had been for her and how much better the double dose version is. Mom is 86 and had less issues with getting her first dose and C covid same arm same day than I did with just the first myself. The second one took a full weekend to get back on my feet. The reminds me I need to make her appointment for the second one.
1581,That shingles shot is going to hurt like heck
1586,I did take the shot under duress to keep my job and GUESS WHO developed a raging case of recurrent shingles that is not managed well with meds AND other auto immune like issues with ZERO prior issues. Wake up. It smells
1596,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got shingles on the left middle of my back which wrapped around my side in 2010 triggered by che mo I would had several months earlier. I got the vaccine about a year ago. I barely reacted to either dose.
1599,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Get well soon. Got shingles in the mid twenties it felt like my flesh on my abdomen was on fire. Do not recommend it.
1600,Beyfortus: Thanks for the link this was interesting to read and terrifying lol we just got the Beyfortus 3 weeks ago. Posting the link to the study again because I have some thoughts on it and do not want my comment deleted and its of course the source of my thoughts haha First of all it seems to me that the risk they discuss is in part hypothesized to be worse in babies a few days old so your kid and mine would be quite a lot older the mechanism they propose would work by making the babies susceptible to respiratory infections while antibody levels are adjusting over the first few days so it might make sense to be more careful in this time window they do however discuss the potential for an effect on the next season also I cannot judge how speculative that is. overall hospitalizations did not go up they were the same as in the control group which means that RSV hospitalization went down and others up but only to the point that it balances out so overall the risk for hospitalization was not increased. I do wonder how that matches the suspected increase in deaths it seems to me that hospitalizations overall should be up if the higher death rate is causal. My background is statistical and not medical though so maybe someone can weigh in on this? All in all I think I Am still glad I got the antibodies for my daughter but I understand your concerns based on this.
1602,i need help: It took me over three months to adjust to the medication and I still have nausea The first two days after I take my shot. Everyone Is body is different. You will find what you can or cannot tolerate any longer or in what amounts. Stick with it. Once you start seeing the weight come off the tradeoff of not feeling well some days will be worth it.
1607,Newbie here: Yes I am 37 and got shingles my first time when I was 22. I have had it 17 times since I was 22 I got the vaccine 3.5 years ago and my outbreaks have actually been worse and more frequent since then no idea why. I have had all the bloodwork under the sun done immune panels etc. and there is no because for my shingles it is just what my body has decided to do Good news is that most people never get shingles in the first place and those that do almost never get it more than once so there is hope for you yet I hope you feel better soon and can kick this and have it be a distant memory
1609,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I also got chicken pox as a 13 year old and I got the diabetes. At 43 I insisted on a vaccine and everyone was all PSSSHHHAAWW YOU do not NEED THAT would not take no for an answer got the doctor to make a prescription or whatever and paid whatever it cost cuz of course not covered. It was maybe 75. Would do it again.
1611,"39yo female, first time with shingles. Numbness after recovery: Sorry that you are going through this. It's a horrible thing to experience. I also had shingles like this nearly 3 years ago. For the itching - I found that cold packs out of the freezer and menthol cream helped. I got it on Amazon. Don't use calamine lotion, it dries and makes it worse. If you can get hold of it aqueous calamine cream should help. I can't help much regarding the numbness. 3 years on, and I still have altered sensation in my face. I started my antivirals within 2 days of initial symptoms. It feels more numb, it is more sensitive to pain and things like plucking my eyebrows or having any acne on that side is much more painful than the other side of my face. When I'm stressed, I get the twinge of pain like a static shock. It has made the top of teeth on that side sensitive, mainly when it's cold and windy. However, I still feel lots better than I did. It may not seem like it currently, but for the majority of people the recovery is good. I'm not on any painkillers or anything, and the longer lasting effects don't stop my daily activities. Try not to stress about what the long-term effects with be as they can really vary."
1612,41 and got Shingles: 42 and got them on July 1st. It was mostly nerve issues that made it feel like I pulled a muscle in my abdomen with a rash that went from my belly button around my side to my spine. The majority of the rash was by my kidney and really only itched at night. Doctor prescribed me prednisone and acyclovir. Its been a month and it seems to be mostly gone with only one spot of the rash lingering.
1615,I hope you do okay with the shingles vaccine It really knocks some people out. I was lucky and just got tired. It is much better than getting shingles so good choice.
1616,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got it on my forehead last year and honestly I just thought it was bad slightly painful acne at first. After a few days I got concerned and had a doctor take a look and apparently the prognosis was that my immune system was kicking its ass and he just gave me ointment so it would not leave scars. It went away about a week later. I take a hefty dose of vitimin D daily so I think I have a fairly tough immune system. I have stopped getting colds even when everyone around me is coughing or has a fever.
1618,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: Its impossible to know but I think so I had a September baby two older siblings in different schools baby went to daycare at 12 weeks and my husband and I both work facetoface with a lot of sick people. Needless to say we have a very germy house from all directions. My baby did get the shot though he was a little older vaccine was not readily available and I had to fight to find it and he did not get RSV
1619,Shingles vaccine: Get it Friday plan on a miserable Saturday. Felt like someone hit every joint in my body w a ballpeen hammer. Both times. And I Am still quite sure its better than actually getting Shingles.
1621,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: While the vaccine primarily aims to prevent shingles altogether if you do develop shingles you will tend to experience much less severe symptoms including less pain.
1622,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Its crazy how recent the chicken pox vaccine is because my husband did not get it because it was not around yet but I did. I Am so thankful that I got it
1623,Some of you may remember I made a post last week about shingles about how I have them and how they are no joke. Well just an update and this is very bizarre. I found out on Monday last Monday that not only do I have a really bad case of shingles but that I broke one of my ribs on the same day that I found out about my rib and I had seen my doctor. I fell face first in the bathroom on our bathroom floor. It was the middle of the night. My husband was sleeping. My mother lives with us. We take care of her but she is almost completely deaf. Now she was just feet away from me in the other room watching TV and she did not hear me fall either. I was so sore but I did not make a big deal about it. I pushed picked myself up off of the floor slowly picked up the cabinet that I had knocked over and went back to bed. Wednesday I was having severe back pain and some trouble breathing. I took my pain medicine and I just chalked it up to my broken rib. I told my doctor she did not want to increase my meds anymore as I am taking so much already but felt that there is something really wrong if I Am on that much pain medicine and I Am complaining about being in pain. So she put me in her schedule for Monday morning we agreed that the next step is to get back Films Fastforward to yesterday morning. I woke up and was so sore but thought I was OK. 10 minutes after my husband left for work the back pain came out of nowhere along with the side pain. It was a horrible stabbing pain and all of the sudden I could not breathe then I started crying because I could not breathe because every time I would breathe I would get that stabbing pain I literally Felt and thought I was dying. I sat here for two hours. Screaming like someone in labor and crying. Debating on what to do because I did not want to call 911 I did not want to leave my mother or my dogs alone. I finally called my husband and he did not answer so I texted him. I said if you do not call me back in two minutes I Am going to call 911 and so that is exactly what happened. I spent the day in the emergency room. I found out in the ambulance that if I laid on my side if I laid on my good side then I do not know for whatever reason I was able to breathe again which helped calm me down some the bottom line diagnosis is that not only did. I break another rib when I fell in the bathroom but I rebroke the first rib that was broken on top of that my shingles have gotten worse and I have a new breakout of sores above the area where my ribs are broken the emergency room doctor said that was very strange but that is what is. I have to say this was one of my more positive emergency room visits even though it was scary because this particular doctor did not treat me like a drug seeker did not treat me like I was weird din any shape or form. He listened to me ad actually physically examine me which a doctor has not done in a long time. They did a bunch of xrays and I just I have to say how wonderful this doctor was because he gave me pain medicine even though I did Not ask for any and actually I was there almost all day. He gave me two different pain medicine shots. If anyone reading this is broken their rib then they know that I mean I had my xrays and then I went to the bathroom and getting up from the toilet the pain started happening again and I was screaming like I was a woman in labor having a baby. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. This is one of the worst pains I have ever had in my life so please take care of yourself and get vaccinated. I know I said that before but really please get vaccinated. If you need to as soon as I am over this I am going to get my vaccine. I do not ever want to go through this again ever I Thank you for listening to me and reading my post. Sorry I Am so wordy this morning but I also wanted to add my little buddy who I Am showing a picture of out of all of our dogs. Hes the youngest and he is a big scary cat But yesterday none of my dogs came near me except for him while I was screaming and crying he came and he sat at my feet. He laid down and just was there with me when I came home from the hospital he followed me everywhere and kept an eye on Me all night. I really cannot believe it. Dog surprise us in the most amazing ways and I thank God for my dogs every day thank you for listening to me go on and on. I hope that everybody has a great day
1624,Pfizer gave my husband sarcoma prostate cancer AND shingles. He got all three within a few months of getting vaccinated.
1625,Mattress haul away NOT guaranteed: Instructions unclear. I put a new mattress on my shingles but they still hurt and I am having trouble moving around with this big mattress on me.
1626,Any parents get the RSV vaccine for their baby yet? on: Same he reacted more to the bandaid than the shots. Did Not even nap in the doc office like he does after his usual shots
1627,Paranoid about shingles: Get the vaccine. I had shingles but have since had three vaccine.
1628,I had my shingles vaccine recently and had ZERO side effects other than my arm being slightly sore. For the 2nd shot I also needed a tetanus booster so he did one in each arm Same thing nothing.
1630,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My dad mid 70s got shingles and it got into his left eye. Almost blinded him. Dad's a pretty tough dude but he said shingles was some misery on a whole new level. I am 45 and I will be getting the vaccine as soon as I am eligible. Learn from your elders and all that.
1634,Shingles vaccine: My second shot was easier than the first but the first was pretty bad
1635,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Had shingles in my late 30s I think about 38 in a time of extreme stress. The pain was annoying but the fatigue was debilitating.
1637,Starting Olumiant: Cholesterol and acne can be a thing so basic common sense healthy eating and lifestyle is a start. Also there is an increased risk of shingles. I am only 45 and have already had shingles once and still have nerve pain. Even though I am too young to qualify I paid to get the shingles vaccine Shingrix early. Shingles is no joke so would encourage that. I was concerned about the risk of baricitinib impairing the response to vaccine but I found a study that said that was not an issue
1641,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I have had the shots. Not only did they have NO effect on my dysautonomia they did not even because an eczema flare at the injection sites which some shots do for me.
1643,41 and got Shingles: I Have had it for about three weeks now. I Am 44. My symptoms are pretty mild as far as pain and itching but it feels like the rash is taking forever to clear up.
1646,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Just wanted to share my experience.... I got the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant with our second but it was not available when we had our two year old. Last month all of us got RSV. The baby 8 weeks at the time just had some congestion and coughing for about 5 days no fever just a lot of snot. My two year old on the other hand got hit like a truck. She had a fever for 3 or 4 days and was pretty miserable especially at night for about a week and a half. We still got it and had some sleepless nights with both kids but I do feel like it would have been much worse for the baby if I had not gotten the vaccine.
1649,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Got it at some point in my late 40 s. On my back over my right kidney. The pain was excruciating. The itch after? Worse. I have a much higher tolerance to pain than to itch
1650,I got my shot for shingles today: I do not need that I have the shakes
1657,How does the shingles vaccine work if you have already had shingles?: I had shingles when I was in my mid30s. About 25ish years later I got a vaccine then got another 3 or 4 years after that. A couple of years after that I got shingles again but it was much milder even though it was on my face and head and did not last nearly as long. I am very glad I had the vaccines.
1666,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: This thread makes me feel better about having long covid and then the flu RSV pneumonia and shingles all in one season. Oh wait. That sucked too. I almost did not survive it. Silver lining do not need a shot any time soon
1667,Shingrix for 50yr olds: Yeah I know I thought it might be a coincidence which is why I kept taking the medicine after the first dose. I Am glad it was the medicine because those headaches were debilitating and I never had another after I stopped.
1669,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: you are now legally obligated to state Where? Source? Also why shake hands at all when you have an active infection going on?
1670,anyone else about to get their first shingles vaccine?: I got mine last year. Did Not feel a thing nor had side effects.
1671,"Shingles Vaccine: Get it. I've had shingles 3X, you DON'T want them. First two times were so so and ouch (inside forearm and spot on ribs, felt like a blowtorch when it woke me up at 1 am, but Capsaicin HP fixed it), 3rd time - I burned my last week of vacation that year ('21), and was taking 2400-3600 mg. of gabapentin (my PCP recommended that dosage, he was right) and hanging over the arm of my recliner listening to podcasts between naps, lol. I had huge blisters from the midline of my front to the midline of my back. I'm still taking anywhere from 1200- 2400 mg. of gabapentin every day for post herpetic neuralgia in the one spot on my back that was the worst blister. That's AFTER a steroid epidural and trigger point injections that did nothing but cause more pain. Please consider getting it. I tell everyone who's over 50 to get it. Shingles SUCK!"
1672,a quick follow up: Hi Brent I had shingles too very painful my husband Reg had them too in the eye right side of face they still flare up still in his eye. he is had them for years. Now we are dealing with lung cancer. He is too weak to cut it out but now he will have to deal with radiation. We have been stressed out for three months over this. Brent make sure you keep going to the doctor and get yourself looked after. Especially with COPD R has that too and enphazema. Take care and do appointments please. You can do this and try to do the best you can 1 day at a time do not worry about your videos too much. faceblowingakiss foldedhandslightskintone heartsuit dogface
1676,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Got it as soon as I turned 50. My very first COVID shots knocked me out worse than Shingrix did.
1677,These two ads are driving me insane am I the only one?: I had shingles on the left side of my waist it is always on one side. It is excruciating It is all internal pain like someone embedded hot sauce covered barbed wire in your body. I got the Shingrux vaccines after and ... got it too more times one time on the roof of my mouth the other on my bra line. Much less intense but still terrible.
1679,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 34 weeker got Beyfortus at around 3 months old in 2023 when it first became available. No side effects whatsoever. RSV is such a risk I would not hesitate on this one.
1690,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: What does frogged mean? I have not had any reactions to vaccines except minor arm soreness and a big red welt on some occasions. I try to ignore it and go about my day.
1692,I do not know if it is my Oz them pic or not. Skin on stomach and back feels like it is the worst sunburn times 10. Doc said it sounds like Shingles but no visible signs. I have had the Shingles vaccine. cannot stand to put on shirt or touch skin. Anyone else had this issue?
1693,"2nd Pfizer injection site slow to heal: I had my 2nd Pfizer shot 15 days ago, and I currently have about a 3 mm ulcerated lesion at the injection site. It reminds me of a wasp sting I once had. The 2nd shot started off with swelling and redness that ultimately grew to about 4 cm in diameter, but it receded within a few days. It actually hurt less than the 1st shot, which left me with a sore arm for much of the following day. The current lesion is not infected, but I am starting to wonder how long it's going to take this thing to heal. I've never reacted to vaccines like the flu shot or Shingrix like this. I think I might be allergic to some component of the Pfizer vaccine. Any ideas?"
1699,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Absolutely. Had Shingles and it was brutal. The constant itching and burning is something you do not want to experience. It does not go away quickly or at least it did not for me. Got the vaccine as soon as the doctor suggested it.
1700,Shingles vaccine: My aunt got it on her face and one eye. Its pretty terrible.
1706,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Actually, I had very mild side effects. Maybe a few aches for one day but that's it. Kudos for getting the shots."
1710,Is it me or is every medication for this condition and its symptoms horrific?: Shingles should be used as a torture chamber tool The worst pain in my life Got it in April still have intense nerve pain on back  hip and have to use lidocaine patches every day. I really wish I could inflict it on a couple of people that should experience such pain because they are ahats But for now Ill just try to make myself feel better
1712,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Got my second dose three weeks ago. No side effects to speak of other than my arm was really sore until just a couple of days ago. Lots of family members who have had shingles. I do not want it. You do not either.
1713,What is this on my upper spine?: It doesn't itch but feels like a pimple. I thought it was a pimple for a while until my husband took a picture of it.
1716,41 and got Shingles: I had a minor case of shingles around the age of 40. Did not think anything of it tangerine size rash on my chest past it off for poison ivy heat rash who knows. It was not too itchy and came and went in about 2 weeks so no big deal I thought. Once the rash was gone and fully resolved is when the pain started. I felt like I was being stabbed in the chest and would regularly double over and pain at my desk. I described the situation of my doctor and my last physical and he immediately said I had shingles. All in all my case was not that bad but I could only imagine how bad it must hurt when you get it all over your face like I have heard some people do.
1720,FML.... I am not only exhausted and in pain but really worried and angry at myself that my baby is going to catch this from me. Yeah I have been sick so often since September that apparently that triggered shingles... My husband never got chickenpox but he got vaccinated because I insisted so much that he does it... Chickenpox vaccine is not mandatory in the UK and I do not know why I have not booked it privately yet. I dropped the ball there... The rash is in my neck and my baby cosleeps half the night with me. So yeah he is been exposed already. This thing fucking hurts. Part of the rash is also in my scalp so I will not be able to wear a headset for work anyway... I should be fine for Christmas but not my baby. I had so many plans for the week off nursery he has. My only hope is that he has a mild case because when I had it? It got complicated with bronchitis.. I hated that stuff Anything I should do to prepare myself for a kid with chickenpox? Already bought extra Calpol and Calamine Edit aaargh. My rash is spreading and I need to be seen. Of course Murphy's law I missed the call from the GP. Now I do not know at what time they will call me.
1730,Shingles and other Vaccines: I would rather feel off for a day or so from a vaccine than be full on ill.
1733,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I got shingles on my face at 44. The urgent care medics freaked out because once it happens on your face the virus can easily travel along the nerve to the eye and blind you. So it is worth fighting for. I got a second round of the Shingrix vaccine 10 years after the first one just to be safe.
1734,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: About to turn 37 and just had my 4th bout of shingles. No I do not plan on getting vaccinated for shingles. I prefer the enemy I know. I have also almost died from getting 2 separate vaccines via anaphylaxis and those were over 10 years apart. So I guess I have to be a bit more cautious.
1735,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: First shot kicked my ass but second one wasn't that bad. I had already planned for two days down so it was a pleasant surprise. I don't think that's the norm though...
1738,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: My mom was sick in bed for a week after hers
1741,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yup Shingrix x2. Not the horrible side effects I expected.
1742,Had groin and ALL nether regions and left buttcheek shingles mid sept to mid october All visible signs cleared 2 weeks ago and just left with scars. Had shingles vaccine 1 week ago. When the hell does this residual burning type feeling go away?? its not horrific. Maybe a 4 10? 5 at most? Makes me PARANOID they are coming back.....
1745,Did anyone else experience nonstop cold clammy sweats with the shingles? I have it in my trigeminal nerve no corneal lesions and no rash and its been about a month since the first symptom burning pain in my sinus and eye swelling followed by sunburn like feeling on scalp and forehead. Probably about 3 weeks since diagnosis. I cannot stop sweating. I feel like I Am broiling from the inside out but its a cold clammy sweat. I do not seem to have much of a fever or anything but I Am just miserable it FEELS like I have a fever even if I do not. I Am not even sure what to do. It gets worse if I tire myself out I Have been falling asleep about every third day for 1416 hours straight as well. Then I Am fatigued but functional for a day or two and then I crash again. This is so frustrating. The pain seems to be worse when I Am in this high sweat mode too. I do not really see anything about this online though. Sigh. Anyway if anyone has any advice about how to calm my body down Ill take it. I cannot sleep for the next month unfortunately.
1746,Shingles and GenX: Last December I had it on my eye forehead and scalp. I am only 45 and was shocked when they told me it was Shingles. That shit was terrible I still feel weird sensations form it to this day.
1750,Shingles diagnosis: I mean I get what you are saying but I Am telling you that oozing is not the only way its transmitted. My husbands shingles were limited to about a 3 area on his butt they were red but not raised not even itchy or hurting.
1752,Shingles vaccine: Also never had chicken pox. I got the titer test I. My 40s and my doc immediately ordered the twopart chicken pox vaccine. It was the roughest summer I ever had so just be forewarned. Lots of fatigue and aches EVERYWHERE. I feel like I Am prepped for my shingles vaccine though.
1756,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Unfortunately no. I know people who have had the cp vaccine and still ended up with shingles later.
1758,A word of warning: I also got shingles right after a 3day fast 37m I had no idea what it was at first and boy did it suck On the flip side I think the immune system weakening can be a good thing though since some people use fasting to manage symptoms of autoimmune diseases.
1760,I am in the target group for RSV so took that one. Already had shingles twice. And told after having it vaccine is virtually ineffective. BY THE WAY if and when you decide to get the RSV that sucker hurts. But other than sore arm no side effects.
1761,That was my first ever rough reaction to a vaccine so I did not get the second half. I chickened out. Recently I went and restarted the shingles vaccine and I did not have a reaction. Make sure you get both halves if that is how your vaccine works.
1763,"The Hepatitis B vaccine has been associated with an increase in Hepatitis B outbreaks among vaccinated individuals, leading to pain, discomfort, and anxiety for many. The unexpected resurgence of Hepatitis B, whether as a first-time occurrence or a reactivation of dormant Hepatitis B, has raised concerns and hesitations about receiving subsequent doses of the vaccine. It appears that the Hepatitis B flare-ups following vaccination are not a direct side effect of the vaccine but rather a consequence of the immune system's response, potentially triggering the reactivation of the virus. Given the recurring discussions on this matter, I wanted to initiate a platform for sharing resources, articles, and videos that may offer insights or address questions regarding Hepatitis B outbreaks after Hepatitis B vaccinations. To ease Hepatitis B symptoms, I've personally found relief through rest, hydration, and the occasional use of over-the-counter pain relievers. I hope these remedies can provide some relief for those grappling with Hepatitis B post-vaccination."
1766,Shingles vaccine experience: The shots were nothing for me except the sore arm. I am very grateful to have had it. As for the future of vaccines I find it unlikely that the pharmaceutical industry which is all about money will allow them to go away because of some antiscience nimrod who says otherwise.
1767,"Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: Anything that doesn't involve assuming everyone who is socially inept is autistic. ETA: sorry if this is off-topic, or whatever ticked off the person who down voted me, but I figured the poster to whom I responded wasn't intentionally being rude and would want a heads up."
1770,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 74 Chicken pox parties were totally a thing in my area. I got them in kindergarten. My mother regretted it terribly though when my younger brother had such a severe case he needed to goto the hospital for it. He had pox all the way down his throat. I will look into the vaccine shingles are super painful I am told.
1775,It is horrible. But let me tell you I started to get shingles after a black widow spider bite that shot was worth the reaction. It stopped shingles before I even got the shingles rash.
1778,I have only heard this term today after posting my symptoms on The Diagnose me subreddit. Long story short I Have had scoliosis ever since I was 9 years old. Worn corrective braces for 6 years and did the usual physiotherapy sessions swimming and light sports. I still have a moderate thoracic and lumbar curve. Approx one year ago I started having this dull ache in the area below my clavicle and first rib it started on one side the pain spreading below as well. but then I noticed that if I stretch a certain way or lay on my back on a low pillow somthing around that area would pop and I would feel instantly better. I thought it was because of my poor posture at first whenever I Am on my phone texting and scrolling. So I started correcting my posture but the pain flairs continued to happen more often. now the pain is on both sides and even with popping the ache persists with pulses of extreme pain when sitting down suddenly when lifting up and straining to push or pull something. Another this worrying me right now is the possibility of a Shingles flair up two years ago i had one below my left breast on the back side a similar pain when breathing currently experiencinghappened for one week before the rash appeared. I will be visitng the doctos office soon to figure this out but I Am looking forward to your experiences and input as well. thanks
1779,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Me and my brother caught chicken pox as kids from our daycarebabysitter's kid. I36f had a case of shingles about 4 years ago. I still have tingling sensations in the area where the blistersrash popped up on my arm when I get goosebumps. In another 20 years I can get the shingles vaccine though.... My insurance will not cover it and my pharmacydocs also will not let me pay out of pocket till in 55.
1782,How to keep NICU baby safe from illnesses after discharge?: We made sure she had her rsv and flu vaccine. We spent Christmas and new year alone at home. When we had visitors they saw her from a distance. We did not go out to social settings until rsv season was over. It was not fun but it was worth our baby not getting sick.
1783,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: No joke I have had it twice. First time I was 10 still have nasty scars from it. Doctor said it was the worst case they ever seen and again in my late 20s. Would love to get my hands on that vaccine but I am in my 30s.
1784,Shingles vaccine: I had mild glue like symptoms my husband had nothing.
1787,Cleared after 4 years: Thanks for sharing I have CIN 1. I have to go back in 10 months I started the vaccine as well
1789,Shingles Is NO Joke: I had a round cup sized perfectly round ring that looked to be burned to my skin on the left side of my upper back. Doctor told me he had a lady the week prior come in with shingles all over her face.
1791,At least 3 people I know went down with shingles after the C19 vac.
1796,Guy in grocery store does not want a free flu shot: OMG I am sorry to hear that Well my insurance paid for mine because I just turned 50.. SO glad I managed to avoid Shingles til I could get the vaccine. Yes it does suck that you can get it way younger. My good friend got it when we were like 25 I remember how absolutely miserable she was for so long.
1797,The doctors just called and asked to give the rsv vaccine to my child and of course I am nervous about anything. He was born at 262 and is currently 322 and perfectly healthy. Has anybody given the vaccine to their child that was still in the NICU? I would love to hear how great your LO is doing
1798,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Lol wonder why she came down with shingles?
1799,It is time for my 2nd shingles shot. That thing hurts
1800,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I Have 33 and had shingles 2 times. Both very mild. Just a small itchy patch on my back then 2nd time on my neck. Both times after mild covid and close covid exposure. So I guess that is what I have to look forward to if I get covid again.
1801,Shingles vaccine experience: That shot beat my ASS both rounds. But I have a friend a few years younger than me who had a bad bout of shingles for weeks and assured me it was way worse than the vaccine side effects so I still think it was worth it.
1802,My mom had painful shingles before a vaccine came out. Her physician gave her a tetanus shot and very quickly pain was gone and the sores next day .
1803,Seeking Personal Experiences with Varicella and Shingrix Vaccines Impact on HSV2HSV1 Outbreaks: I got the shingles vaccine. Someone I met on Reddit got the Chicken Pox vaccine it also made their outbreaks worse.
1808,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: A coworker got it in her eye and was hospitalized for 2 weeks she was lucky to have minimal sight loss from it. It is a scary nasty disease.
1809,Second Shingles Shot: My first one leveled me but like you my second I got nothing more than a slightly achy arm
1810,Shingles Sucks: I had it a couple years ago at 48 and I just remember being so tired for such a long time afterward
1816,My journey started 8 months ago. I am a 48yearold white female and according to my research and dermatologist findings I fall into the 12 demographic category. My diagnosis came after a 6day hospital stay. I developed a large abcess right at my front hairline in the center of my forehead. I had a fever of 104 and massive lymph nodes the redness was moving down my forehead with severe pain in my right ear. I was treated with three different IV antibiotics and highdose steroids. Eventually the oncall surgeon consulted and felt for this to heal he would need to drain it. He made a twoinch incision cleaned as much of the access possible and then packed it. After being discharged from the hospital my PCP arranged for me to see a dermatologist the next day. After a very short one or 2minute exam she said Well you have Dissecting Cellulitis. This is extremely rare among caucasian women. When I asked her how long it would take for a twoinch diameter bald area hair to grow back she said Honey that hair is never coming back She said we must go at this hard your infection and inflammation are deep and widespread. Before I left her office she gave me 20 steroid injections and ordered highdose oral steroids medicated head wash and an antibiotic combination of doxycycline and cephalexin. That was four months ago I lost at least 60 of my hair and incorporated a natural regimen of essential oils and red light therapy but nothing seems to help. Below you will find my photos starting an initial outbreak that I thought was an allergic reaction and PCP diagnosed as shingles.
1818,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Ooh this happened to me accidentally I have 3 brothers and one appeared to be coming down with chicken pox right as the vaccine was coming available. My mom rushed the rest of us into a hospital and paid a ton to get us vaccinated but by then it was too late
1819,When the pandemic started I took COVID seriously. When the vaccines came I got the vaccines and I behaved cautiously. It was around aboit autumn of 2022 when was pushed to the back of my mind for me. I got covid that summer in 2022. It was about 2 weeks of an illness. I got sick again in the October time but home covid tests were negative. I got covid more recently. People who say covid is a cold are gaslighting assh0les because it is anything but. I had fevers close to 40 at points earlier this week. I think my exposure came from a concert last weekend. I was going to go to another concert in August and now I am thinking very strongly not going. Reading this sub scares me. Reading that you can get covid again within a matter of weeks. That scares me. Infection was like a flu. It was awful. Also reading this subs is that covid can weaken the immune system and I read on a local sub that there is a lot of people getting shingles. The two likely goes hand in hand. I think I am going to be better off staying low key for many weeks to come. Focusing on supplements good foods and masking in public and crowded places. What do you guys think. Covid is actually genuinely scaring me now. Colds and flus do not behave like this but there is so many people believing that covid is nothing more but a sniffle. I cannot believe some people are so psychopathic when it comes to illness and just doing whatever they want and passing on illness. I was on a local forum and someone told me just to go out and live my life. My thermeter was showing fevers of nearly 40C and bed was the only place for me and likely hospital if it got worse.
1821,Shingles vaccine experience: We just have not but should. My Dad had a mild case but it was on his face close to his eye. I did not know it could be such a big deal. Ill schedule an appt. Thanks for posting.
1822,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: My friend had regular seizures after the vaccine for years.
1824,"22M, fainted after first dose of Gardasil - second dose?: Around April I got the HPV shot, along with boosters of other vaccines (tdap and varicella I think, but I'm not so sure). The other shots were painless, but the HPV shot (which was the last one) hurt A LOT and I fainted after like 2 seconds. I woke up a moment later with a very freaked out nurse by my side. My doctor wasn't very clear if I should come back, but it sounded like I don't need to worry. I might be wrong though. So, should I go back for the second and third dose? Is it not worth it because I'm a guy?"
1826,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Had my first colonoscopy at 49 whew doggie! On the same note best sleep ever."
1828,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had it and it was not a big deal, my skin around the blisters just kinda hurt for a few days."
1829,Do you need a prescription for the varicella (chickenpox) vaccination??: This happened a while ago but I still cannot find the right answer. It was pretty busy at our pharmacy one day when this girl (aged 23) came in for a varicella vaccine. At our pharmacy no appointment is needed. The girl said that she called earlier and had spoken to the pharmacist working earlier that she could come in and get it. When I alerted the pharmacist on duty she denied the vaccine and said that the girl needed a prescription for it. I know this is true for the shingles vaccine but I've never heard of it for the chicken pox (though most people get the vaccine at a young age). Idk if the pharmacist was just being lazy or if a prescription is truly needed. This is in California btw.
1830,I had chills and shook all night. But I have had friends who got shingles and that sounds much worse. An underappreciated psychological aspect of vaccination is that you must voluntarily accept the risk of side effects whereas with simply getting sick you can always blame fate.
1836,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine but still got the pox
1839,Shingles week 29: Oof That Is the worst My mouth sore scabbed over last night so I Am actually able to eat solids today but the random fevers high blood pressure spikes and headaches are the things giving me trouble. I Am feeling a lot better today than the last few days so that is something My husband has been making an oatmeal paste for my face sores to help soothe them and that has been a life saver too. I pretty much wfh so I let people know at work that I may have to take naps periodically today and no one has seemingly has issue with that.
1841,Well that looks nothing like shingles. I know so many people that took the c19 vaccine and not one of them have developed that rash. My son has a allergic reaction to penicillin and none of those pictures how he reacted to it.
1845,Shingles vaccine experience: I got both shindrix shots and yes there was some ache in my arm. BUT I watched my mom suffer from shingles for decades and it was awful for her. No question all of her kids got the shots.
1849,My sons teacher gave her 2 daughters a shared bath after the one got the varicella vaccine and the other child got shingles afterwards.
1850,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Yeah this is my approach. We got my boy the extra meningococcal shots for improved protection and when we travelled we went for everything.. hep a typhoid Japanese encephalitis tuberculosis BCG..
1852,Vaccine Megathread: Also due in February. I got the RSV vaccine a few weeks ago zero side effects not even a sore arm. My OB and the pharmacist both said they have not gotten complaints about side effects.
1855,Shingles vaccine: No on shingles vaccine but yes to other vaccines he p b covid moderna and flu. It essentially forces your body to have an immune response and when we have an immune response it ups our insulin needs sometimes. I am going to it is a to be expected kind of thing IF we are the kind of person that has this. My endo told me some of her patients are like this and some are not. I have some years the flu vaccine does not do this so I do not like pre bolus my vaccine or anything BUT I tend to be ready to do it. The first moderna did not do it to me either and this never happened to me as a kid. But I noticed it start for me in my early 20's dx age 7.
1856,"Debating skipping second Pfizer shot due to reaction to first shot: After receiving the first Pfizer vaccine shot, I had some pretty rough reactions. My arm was extremely sore, making it difficult to move for a few days. I also had a high fever and flu-like symptoms that persisted for almost a week. I know it wasn't Covid because I had already been vaccinated and recently had it. I'm contemplating not getting the second shot because of the potential reaction. Can anyone provide some encouragement or share their own experiences? EDIT: Thank you for the feedback and suggestions. I didn't mention it before, but I had planned to get both the 4th Covid booster and the 2nd Pfizer booster on the same day, which made me nervous. I recognize the importance of the Pfizer vaccine, but I've decided to space them out. I'll opt for the Covid booster first and wait a few weeks before getting the Pfizer booster. I appreciate all the insights shared here."
1859,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember going around preschool one of my earliest memories and someone getting it as a 10yo. Preschool look I had them in my ear On my tongue 10yo it was the worst I ever felt. She still looked awful even when she came back to school. I got shingles right after chicken pox and again in 2020. As soon as you think you might have it see a doctor. The prescriptions are generally well tolerated.
1862,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I ended up with chickenpox at 14 before the vaccine came out. It was the sickest I have ever been in my life. I had prodromal symptoms a week before the pox broke out and the real illness began. I lost over 20 pounds and had the pox everywhere on my body except for my palms and the soles of my feet. I even had them in my mouth and throat. I had zero appetite and even when I did eat or drink the pain was immense. My back is loaded with scars because there was no way to avoid the scabs from coming off prematurely due to the sheet number of them. When I woke up it was as if I spilled an entire box of corn flakes in my bed. Forget about shingles I wish my parents had sent me to a chickenpox party so I would have avoided this nightmare. I cannot imagine how worse it would have been if I became infected at an older age.
1863,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My daughter was in the trial for the RSV vaccine and she got it in Nov 2022 Harmonie trial. She was totally fine never got RSV that I am aware of after it. She is over two years old now.
1864,Shingles vaccine: Got my shots before the pandemic. The second shot kind of hit hard. But it is worth it. Having had chicken pox in middle school I definitely do not want shingles. My FIL had shingles it was miserable.
1869,Shingles and other Vaccines: This is what I have seenreadheard as well. It seems to be particularly unpleasant at the second dose. It tracks since as others have pointed out a strong reaction to a vaccine means a strong immune response to it. This is likely with a booster. I agree that we are not being babies about this Kudos for getting the vaccine it really is important. I have had it but only a small patch that was excruciating enough. I do not want it again.
1871,Was this really a thing?: Chicken pox at youth Yay I am home from school Shingles over the age of 50 Fuck my life kill me now.
1872,First dose down: I have not had any side effects yet with the low dose
1876,I am a healthy 33 year old and myself and 2 of my friends around the same age all got shingles following our employer forcing us to get vaccinated to keep our jobs.
1881,I Am 34 weeks and 5 days and I also have gestational diabetes plus a pretty delicate pregnancy. During my doctors appointment today I was put with a doctor I had not seen before. She made a comment about needing the RSV shot which I told her I had gotten about 23 weeks ago. She said I actually had not received that shot but had gotten the flu shot and the TDAP vaccine. Since I had not received the RSV shot I told her to go ahead and give me that one as well. An hour after getting home I get a call saying they made a mistake and I had indeed received the RSV shot before. The nurse said the doctor does not think it will affect anything but said they are trying to reach the vaccine manufacturer but they are closed. She said she will reach out to me tomorrow with more information but advised I go to the Emergancy room or give them a call to the on call phone in case I have any symptoms or start feeling off. I Am trying not to freak out right now but I Am really frustrated and worried. I do not know what symptoms I should look for and I understand people make mistakes but I do not want to see this doctor again. Side note earlier in this appointment she told me I needed to up my insulin dosage. Later in that same appointment she tried to up the dosage again before I reminded her she had just upped it.
1882,Shingles vaccine: Out of all my vaccines this was the worst and I had the Covid one 6 times.
1883,Absolutely awful reaction I really thought long and hard about the 2nd dose. I Have cancer. However i have shingles twice in my younger days. Id say the reaction was worth it.. as the long term effects of shingles was brutal
1885,FML... I got shingles: For me it is the nights that are getting trickier but I am scared of a night hypo.. last time I had one of course my baby woke up every hour to nurse. 8 could not keep up
1888,I had my 2nd shingles shot earlier this summer. Only had a slightly sore arm. Good luck
1890,Shingles second vaccine: Right? I had chickenpox for nothing at this point The pneumonia was rough too. That swelling was INSANE
1892,The shingles vaccine helps your body's immune system build up a solid defense against shingles so you may experience temporary side effects after getting the shots. These side effects may include Pain or soreness at the injection site. Redness or swelling at the injection site.
1893,41 and got Shingles: Got them at 33. Went to the ER twice with fever chest pain and calf pain. No one has any idea what was going on. Went through every test they had to rule out DVTPE heart attack etc. Finally was prescribed steroids which seemed to help some. Then about a week later noticed a small rash in my toe shingles. Crazy how it manifested and it was not even on the differential diagnosis until the rash. Makes sense given I was working like 70 hours a week at the time and under a lot of stress
1895,First shingles vaccine side effects: Hate to say but the second one hit me hardest.
1896,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox as a kid and gave it to my mom. It got on her organs and was hospitalized for two weeks. Nearly killed her.
1900,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: My sister had it in her eye. Her vision has been permanently affected. She had shingles in her 30 s.
1902,Shingles and GenX: I felt like shit but shingles is much worse
1903,"Can't believe the difference between my first and second shingles vaccine. The first one was smooth sailing, but the second one had me feeling all sorts of reactions. Here's hoping it's worth it in the long run!"
1904,Hives outbreak  Emergency room: But do you I might have got shingles after the vaccine and is it possible to get it right after vaccine? Shin gri x is an in activated vaccine it contains no actual virus that could because an infection.
1907,Second Shingles Shot: It is the most painful vaccine I recall receiving. As in when they pushed that plunger that shit hurt I would still do it again to avoid Shingles. I had the chicken pox when I was 22 and that shit was brutal The vaccine came out about 3 months prior to me getting chicken pox. I did not know there WAS a vaccine at the time or I would have gotten it
1909,Tell me about your vaccine flares: As a young person that got the shingles just last year old enough to have a chicken pox playdate and also just miss the varicella vaccine being common but wayyy too young to have shingles vaccine covered by insurance...Can confirm it is fucking awful. Absolute misery. Takes a month or two for an average person to recover. The random pain strikes along with neuropathy how? for months afterward was insane.
1911,Vaccine after shingles?: I am waiting 6 months since it cleared and getting it. I cannot wait. Several people I know have felt kind of crappy after the 2nd shot but totally worth it.
1912,Look here people complaining about how much their arm hurts after getting the shingles vaccine? They are not playin'. This shit HOITS
1917,How long does it take for gabapentin to kick in?: I am about a month and a half into shingles the rash cleared up but the pain is unbearable even after a week of taking gabapentin. It varies for everyone immensely and I have heard a lot do not get relief from gabapentin with nerve pain from shingles.
1919,Oh shit shingles vaccine is rough on its own. I do not recommend this protocol but hopefully you have cleared your weekend.
1920,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Literally just did this. UGHH. I AM SO FUCKED UP RIGHT NOW.
1923,Hi everyone I Have been on Rinvoq for almost 6 months now. I Am also still on Dupixent if that matters. I had my first shingrix vaccine about a month after starting it. They told me i have a 26 month window to get the second shot. I was planning on doing it this week but i came down with a bad flufever and the pharmacist told me to hold off until i am feeling better. I Am just really scared of getting shingles since my immune system is extra low right now. Can anyone share their experience and if they got shingles after only having 1 vaccine? Thanks
1930,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah it happened to me. Childhood friend got chickenpox so they had us have a sleepover. Got shingles at 27. One side of my head is permanently scarred and has weird areas without feeling.
1931,Shingles at injection site: Interesting. I got Shingles about 8 months after starting dupixent and the rash lasted way longer than I expected. I did not know it was related to the dupixent my dermatologist never mentioned it either. It was during an extremely stressful period for me so I just figured that brought it on.
1933,"Sharing my experience with 2-3 day post injection side effects from the GSK vaccine. It's been a rough few days, but I'm grateful for the protection it offers. How are you managing any reactions you may have encountered?"
1935,33 female asian on and off ear irritation for the last few months noise started 2 weeks ago. I take daily alvesco for minor asthma. Flonase and claritin for allergies. So I had a cold in late Oct to early November Went swimming right before I got sick so my throat and ears were irritatedclogged. Was also on vacation so had to fly. My right ear would feel better than achey again on and off Then i caught Covid around christmas. My ear was hurting the 2 days leading up to a positive covid test. Probably related. Its been 2 weeks. One day my ear felt really itchy so I scratched it with a qtipi know its very bad. I was not sure if there is water in there so I also put alcohol in my ear. It stung so bad.probably because I scratched the inside. Now my ear crackles when i rub it and if I pull on my earlobe there is whooshingwindnoise. Like if you left a tiny crack on your car window. Sometimes it feels a bit clogged so i drop some alcohol whooshing goes away but comes back the next day. There was 2 days last week where i had a small amount of clear drainage and small bits of wax. My ear does not hurt at all and no lost of hearing. Sometimes i will get the feeling of water or something in my ear. Like when i walk it move around with each step I think I might have a minor damaged ear drum from reading on symptoms... other thing is i have to use ear plugs to sleep but they are disposable foam ones so not reused. I also use a bit of vaseline to help the earplugs go in. Should I go see my doc? Or just let my ear heal on its on? I just got a job promotion so I really do not want to take a day off.... Also my other ear is now infected too for the last 2 days but has slowly been getting better.... but I think that is just post covid weakened immune system. Last 2 times I had Covid I had minor shingles a month after. Also to mention I have a infection in my nose. I never figured out if it is a cold sore in my nose or a bacterial infection. It leaves little bumps on the inner edge of my nostril. I get this infection once inawhile especially when I get a respiratory infection. It goes away on its own in a week or so. I Am guessing it has to do with all the nose blowing and breaks in the skin
1937,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Same went to a chickenpox classroom in the early 90s simply because getting it as a young child was the best time and the least dangerous. I got away with only one scar but plenty of kids my generation were less lucky. And to this day I remember how horribly itchy I felt I even had a rash in my ear Choosing that over a vaccine is mad. I Am glad she got shingles sweet revenge.
1938,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: When did you have the chicken pox vaccine? I never had chicken pox was vaccinated at a child and developed shingles in 2020 at 22. The urgent care I went to told me that my age group of vaccinated kids is having a much higher rate of shingles occurring. I never looked into it heavily but that s what the doctor said
1941,My husband had it last week and was very surprised by how painful it was at the site of the needle entry. No other physical effects apart from that and I have heard that shingles can be deeply unpleasant so better vaccinated than not.
1943,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I did not have much of a reaction to shingles vaccine COVID vaccine knocks me on my ass every time. As for the butt doc at least you get good sleep once every two years. Your poor wife has to wait ten years for that propofol rest
1946,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: Same. My optic nerve was fine but it made my eye constantly tear up bad. It was the oddest thing I have ever experienced. I kept telling my husband the day before the rash started that it felt like I got hit in the face with a bat or something. Next day the redness started and I got in with my pcp. I told them I think I have shingles and got 'oh I am sure that is not it you are young but we' ll humor you and give you an appt.'. Walked out with a valtrex rx and orders to see an ophthalmologist. Thankfully being proactive meant I did not have the horrid blisters and scarring. I worked in a hospital at the time and in the Er we had a few shingles cases that week. They say it is not contagious like that but it was weird.
1948,Flu shot on shot day?: Flu and shingles both on shot day. All fine sore arm but no other issues.
1951,I have a 3 month old. SILs bf'slet us call him Eric son 12m let us call him Alan came over for Christmas and was sick. I did not know at first until he was coughing 15 minutes into the visit. I tried to be okay with just asking Alan to wash his hands but after watching him wet hacking cough into his hands then touching my baby's spaces I had a panic attack all while they are denying Alan's sick and I yelled for everyone to get out because I will not hospitalized my baby to be polite. They claimed he was on an antibiotic and it was fine. I doubled down and made every person leave. My family works in NICUs so I am perhaps too informed about infant health. Husband's parents are very uncomfortable and not very happy w me but I have been very strict about his health from the get go so this was not exactly new though they are saying it came out of nowhere. Husband is on my side but feels bad for his parents. Husband reached out to Eric and asked that they in the future inform us of any illnesses beforehand when they know they will be around the baby so we can make a decision regarding postponing or not attending events. They did not answer but through ILs they supposedly are adamant he was not sick and will not respond. They said Alan was vaccinated against RSV a lie because that does not exist for his age. They were just trying to minimize my concerns. Baby woke up 2 days later sick unable to lay him down hes coughing so badly. Turns out Alan had a fever 2 nights before and was still taking tylenol to feel better. There was no doctors appointment or antibiotic as they claimed. Another lie. Still no apology from anyone. ILs are saying babys get sick and you cannot protect them from everything and will not admit anyone did anything wrong. Well we went to the pediatrician. My 3 month old has rsv. I Have never been so mad in my life i want to burn the world down. I Am sitting here tolding my poor sick 3 month old sobbing. I should have kicked everyone out sooner. I blocked SIL and refuse to see Eric and Alan ever again. ILs are banned for at least a month extended every time they see Eric and Alan. And still no apology to my husband or I from anyone. Please send good vibes for little one. My heart breaks for the baby i was supposed to protect but let down What would you do?
1952,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Our 34 weeker had it on day 5 of life the next day she ate a little less and we got the feeding tube placed again but we cannot be sure if it was the vaccine or jaundice that contributed. Overall I am glad I gave her the vaccine
1955,That Was It??: Exactly I was shocked after the first injection too. Thought I did it wrong because I literally did not feel it. Searched the site here and realized that it is common. Welcome to the journey Good luck
1956,Happened to my mother inlaw after her shingles vaccine
1962,Medical history eczema dishydrotic eczema scalp psoriasis asthma pneumonia age 2 walking pneumonia age 13 keratosis pilaris strep throat 10 times in youth hsv2 genital and beside my right eye mononucleosis cmv covid19 staph infection BV have probably been put on antibiotics 20 times in my life at least for various illnesses and infections. Current meds 500mg valtrex daily. currently on amoxicillin for a root canal. overall healthy currently and have not gotten as sick as I have been in the past couple of years. Situation I was illnessprone in childhood. In high school things were pretty normal. In college I fell apart. Got vaccinated with Covid19 came back to school and then got the flu croup strep Covid and herpes back to back 3 month period. Herpes diagnosis January 2022. My initial herpes outbreak was so bad I could not swallow and almost had to be admitted for dehydration. Swabbed my genitals and tonsils both positive for HSV2. Recurrent tonsillitis for 1 year. Got tonsils removed which helped. Got genital outbreaks up to every 2 weeks and at least once a month for 1.5 years. Now have not had one in 6 months which is amazing. January 2023 diagnosed with hepatitis  jaundice caused by mononucleosis and CMV attacking my liver aka not hep13 which i was tested for and do not have it was mono caused hepatitis. Tired and run down for a couple of months. A month ago sensitivity and eczema like outbreak next to my right eye sensitivity in conjunctiva of left eye. visual diagnosis of herpes  shingles looked more like herpes to me but the two doctors disagreed and could not get a conclusive swab. Recurred at least one time since then and prodrome more than that. Blood test shows only hsv2 but possible antibodies have not developed yet so question mark for whether its type 1 type 2 or shingles. So all this to say this is not normal and I am at a loss for why I am so susceptible to herpes viruses especially. Constant recurrence prodrome hsv mono cmv and now possibly shingles. another suspicious rash that i am getting tested see previous post that is extremely itchy. i am so tired. have any of you run into this before? what could be wrong with me? i am leaning towards some kind of immune deficiency because i do not think this is normal at all. Any ideas appreciated.
1964,"After getting the pneumonia vaccine, my grandmother, who lives with us, suddenly came down with a bad case of pneumonia. Then, a few days later, my younger brother also started showing symptoms. Now I'm starting to feel unwell too. It's such a strange coincidence that we all got sick after the vaccine. Has anyone else experienced something similar after getting the pneumonia vaccine?"
1966,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I wonder if you still have to get it if you have had shingles? I had it when I was 40. Was not terrible but the lasting tingles were annoying.
1970,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: So I had shingles a few years ago. During the day I kept having this itching sensation on my forehead no IN my forehead. The itch was not on my skin it was inside. I was puzzled but not concerned. That evening I called my mother who is registered nurse and started to describe my symptoms. She interrupted me. You have shingles. Get to an ER now I went got antiviral medications and crisis averted. The virus was working its way down my forehead towards my eye but I got the medicine in time. Never had any pain or eye problems. I went to my eye doctor the next day to be sure everything was fine. I kind of shudder to think about what could have happened. Thanks Mom.
1971,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yes. Mine was Moderna too. It was intense compared to Pfizer (?)
1977,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Kids who get the vaccine are still at risk to get shingles. Its still introduces the virus into the system. My kid at about 4 years old had a terrible rash that was extremely painful. She had it on her legs and had a hard time walking. She started crawling because it did not hurt as bad as walking. I took my kiddo to the doctors. They said it was either shingles or some other rash that I cannot remember the name of. I said she 4. How could she get shingles and the doctor said something to the effect that she had the chickenpox vaccine. Kids are starting to get shingles because of it. She never had a rash like that since so I am assuming it was the other rash. But found it interesting that because she had the vaccine the risk of getting shingles at a younger age is higher. Crazy.
1979,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: First I hope its your one and only I took a vaccine but.. who knows.. at 56 that was 6 years ago Stay healthy folks
1981,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: My sister is vaccine and still got shinglesso there is that
1983,Hi these weepy skin lesions show up every few months on my lower legs shins and calves. When they are active they are painful tingling and burning for a few days. Second picture is a lesion that is actively burning and painful. The first and third photos are what happens after 2448 hours they scab over and eventually heal. They do not itch at all. Only on lower legs. I spent a long time traveling in developing countries with poor hygiene lots of communal living so all weird causes are probably possible. Also currently work on a farm and wear tall rubber boots a lot of the day. It seems like shingles but I was vaccinated as a child and have not had chicken pox to my knowledge. Thoughts? Thank you.
1986,Need Clarity on Sexual Health : I took the HPV Vaccine. I have had no side effects so far
1988,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Did it hurt me? No from memory my arm ached for a bit but that was pretty much it. Just thinking about it was more like about 10 years ago when I got a fishing hook stuck in my leg.
1991,Just had my first case of shingles after getting the Pfizer vaccine. I'm a 28-year-old woman and never experienced shingles before. It's been a tough few weeks dealing with the pain and discomfort. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
1992,Maternal RSV Vaccine Too Close to Delivery?: I got the vaccine right at 36 weeks in late October it was a whole ordeal late year trying to find someone who could give it to pregnant persons as the ruling was so new and then ended up delivering at 37 weeks due to preeclampsia. My baby was able to get Beyfortus from her pediatrician despite the fact that I had the vaccine because it was unlikely she would been fully protected. She was also born in early November RSV season early and very small under 5lbs so those were other reasons it was okd. Id still talk to your doctor and the pediatrician you are choosing just in case.
1994,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Got shingles yesterday. Appointment for shot in two weeks. . Wish Id gotten it two weeks ago
1998,Is your immune system affected?: Coincidence or... Not? Any answer from a neurologist? HZ can potentially attack anywhere in the body could that include brain? Nowadays there is a vaccine for that two rounds. I took it. HZ is so painful never more in my life.
2001,I 35f had shingles 6 months ago on my back. It was horrible. The rash lasted a month and nerve pain was 4 months and I Have never regained full feeling to some parts. Yesterday I noticed a small rash starting again which my doctor confirmed today is in fact shingles. This time I have it on my face. I keep getting told that shingles is stress induced but like last time as well as this time I have not been stressed at all. On the contrary things in my life have never been better. Started a wonderful new job that came with an amazing pay increase and I love my new co workers. Things in my new relationship are great and there are no dramas with my family. So I do not understand why I am getting this again. Honestly the only thing truly stressful that is happened to me in the last 6 months has been having shingles. What are factors that lead to shingles outside of stress? Is there anything I can do to help prevent this from happening again? Should I get the vaccine? I just assumed at 35 they do not offer it to me because I am too young.
2004,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: I am getting my second in January. My friend got shingles on her face last year and we are same age
2005,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If you are still in the first two days of the infection go get the antivirals. My shingles lasted less than a week and barely had symptoms after the first two doses. My brother in law has nerve damage and has to get the area checked annually for necrosis because he thought he could just tough it out
2010,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Your MIL is horrible and a complete moron. I know someone who got shingles before she could get the shot and the shingles got in her blood so she ended up in the hospital. It wrecked her body so much she had to stop working permanently.
2011,Shingles vaccine: I had it on my face up one nostril and inside my mouth. Plus the eardrum pain. 2 courses of Valtrex to keep it out of the optic nerve. You absolutely do not ever want to get it.
2016,"OBs can't figure out what's causing my abnormal discharge: 27F I have SLE in remission but my immune system is weak I also had shingles and nerve damage Taking HCQs, Prednisone(not daily) and vitamins I've been having abnormal greenish vaginal discharge without foul odor for 2months now. I consulted 2 different OB, they gave me 4 different antibiotics and an antibiotic shot (not at the same time) but nothing worked. They did several tests but still can't figure out what causes it. Any idea what this can be or what other tests I can take for them to figure out what it is?"
2017,got covid shot. doc checked OK as I had Covid 4 months ago. Turns out it is the Government trying to push back to 6 months after to ration supply. Then say they have Zoster for shingles. Did Not have it before. Government pushed back as its 560ish. Free 65
2020,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: That is absolutely true and be careful who you tell at work I was a traveling dental assistant so I would travel with the hygienist or dentist to nursing homes mental facilities etc.. well one day I told the hygienist I thought was my friend and she went and told the owners that she will not work with me because she has a baby and does not want shingles even after I told her I keep it covered waterproof bandaid and 2 layers of clothing on my back and so the owners said I could not finish my week out there but they are letting me go the rest of that week they made me feel like I had bubonic plague I was in my 20s and never felt so bad in my life so I never tell anyone now I have had shingles more times than i can count and have never given it to anyone
2021,First time with shingles is this normal?: Hey yes unfortunately all very normal its playing havoc with your nerves. What Is totally normal is that its all on the same side of your body. You have this in the same place I did and it spread from my mid back to my sternum in a half ring around my body. I also had arm and shoulder pain. Keep taking your antivirals and get a decent nerve pain killer if you do not already have one.
2022,Age 29 Gender Female Weight 110 Medications Spironolactone Antiviral Prednisone and a topical steroid I started getting a horrible rash on my ribs Saturday. First doctor suggested shingles but did not prescribe the antiviral as a wait and see. Second doctor said it was contact dermatitis because there was a small spot on the left side of my stomach. She suggested it was not shingles because it would not appear on both sides. It seems to be wrapping around my back to my front. My skin is also tingly I feel feverish but no fever slight chills but overall I cannot tell if I am convincing myself it is worse than it is. First doctor decided to prescribe the Antiviral this afternoon so I started taking that. My concern is if it really is not shingles then can the antiviral harm me? I did have chicken pox as a child. Will link additional photos in comments.
2026,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Dude same It was a million times worse than the chemo
2028,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: I got my 31 weeker the vaccine I think around 34 weeks. He did not have any Brady's from it but I understand your concern. I personally was more worried about him getting rsv than another Brady though since he was still in the NICU at the time and was closely monitored. I did not want to stress about rsv when we left.
2030,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I currently have shingles and let me tell you I wish I had gotten the shot. I Am not sick exactly but man am I uncomfortable.
2033,41 and got Shingles: Yes. Apparently a lot of people our age got shingles after having COVID. Mine started as excruciating pains in my leg. They got so bad I could barely stand or walk. Two trips to the ER thinking maybe I had blood clots after having Covid And nothing came back . On my third and final trip to the ER I noticed a patch of bubbled up skin on my back and the immediately put me in an isolation room. My shingles head attacked the sciatic nerve hence the radiating in debilitating pain in my leg. It also affected disseminated affecting both sides of my bodyand my left lung. Apparently can also spread to ones brain but thank Jeebus that did not happen to me. I was Stuck in the hospital for nine days over Christmas on IV antibiotics. Yay
2035,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles when I was 27. I did not think I was stressed but I guess I was lol. I caught it early it was itchy on my right shoulder. I started antivirals and was out of work for about a week.
2036,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah it sucked a lot. I ended up in a dark room for three months. Could Not look at a computer screen or TV. Still get eye inflammation every month or so. Fuck shingles. Get the shingrix vaccine as soon as you qualify.
2038,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox when I was 26 and I wish my parents had tossed me into a room full of infected kids when I was a kid. I had sores INSIDE MY THROAT and almost had a seizure. They did a CAT scan and said I had pox on the lining of my brain causing a huge fever and encephalitislike symptoms. I would not wish this on anyone and I Am getting the Shingles vaccine as soon as I can because I know how bad that can be.
2040,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: I am sorry you are going through this. I know how painful it must be and it is very frustrating when it is reoccurring. My first round of shingles at 25 was similar. Mine was all over the back of my skull and I had a baseball size lump in my neck for months. The shingles kept reoccurring that year every six weeks. It took about a year for me to fully heal. I went to an internal medicine doctor at that point who had me completely overhaul my diet at that time. He said no amount of antiviralspain meds would really help me recover. Meds are great and suppressing symptoms but not always the best at curing them. So I cut out everything but fruits veggies and lean meat. I started vitamins managing my stress and slowly healed my body. 70 of your immune system is in your gut. When that is inflamed and struggling it is hard to heal from anything and most medications will only continue to mask the symptoms. Obviously treatments look different for everyone but I learned a lot how meds can often because more harm than good sometimes.
2041,Do your research 1 in 3 get shingles in their lifetime The vaccine has temporary side effects much like any vaccine sore arm muscle pain tiredness fever
2049,Can any kind of immune response mess with BG levels?: I had no reaction to the RSV vaccine but i have read that about the COVID vaccine
2054,An important story from Never knew I had chickenpox until I got shingles near my right eye. Derm prescribed Valacyclovir. Took the 2 Shingrix shots after it cleared. Forever grateful to Dr. Lewitt. A small scar reminds me how lucky I was.
2062,Are there social media accounts out there that talk about research and educate young parents about vaccines? Bonus points if they debunk common vaccine myths. I think the only way to combat the misinformation and hysteria among the younger generations is to reach them through the same media. My niece is a young new mom  as in 18 with a 3 month old  and I Am sure she is been sucked into some tiktok vaccine rabbit hole. She told me her main concern is in her words there is research linking vaccines to SIDS. I know she is not actually reading research articles herself. This is a critical window of opportunity because her baby has RSV. Luckily my niece got the vaccine while she was pregnant so its not as bad as it could be. She has so many misconceptions that I Am trying to set right but she will not hear it from me.
2064,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Wow. What a great grandmother. Giving her granddaughter a life long worry of shingles... My brother got it very young 20s the amount of pain he was in... That poor baby wtf is wrong with that woman. I would get a restraining order honestly.
2065,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: I got the maternal vaccine while pregnant and then my baby got the infant vaccine at her 2 week appt. I did not notice any effect on my baby at all ie irritability fussiness fever etc. The actual vaccine was a quick poke to her Thigh and I immediately fed her to calm her after.
2069,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had a super mild case in my 20 s just a tiny spot that did not really hurt or itch too much. My sister also had a mild case. But we are both now vaccinated anyway well I need to get the second dose in a month or so which I do not look forward to since the first one was a little rough. I do not think everyone gets a terrible case of it but you just do not know.
2071,Shingles vaccine at 27?: Its crazy this just popped up in my feed. I JUST learned the hard way that a shingles vaccine would have been a smart play. I Am 36. I had unknown nerve and muscular pain that started in my foot and ankle Dec 6. Progressed up my leg and to my lower back. Was able to get in to see the nurse practitioner for my primary care physician Dec 13. They had no clue what could be the because. The bumps showed up the night after the appt so I took a pic and sent it to them through my online chart. Monday morning dec 16 the nurse called me and told me to go to urgent care. They diagnosed me with shingles right away. Test came back positive the next day. She prescribed valtrex but said it was unlikely to help much since it works best if started within 48 hours of the first symptom . I Am currently still on gabapentin 3x a day because while the nerve pain has dissipated it is still there. It fucking sucks. I only learned after being diagnosed and doing my own research that it would have been a good idea to get a shingles vaccine. The nurse at my latest infusion even said it would not hurt to get one for pneumonia too just in case. Anyway get the vaccine. It can only help.
2072,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: A bit but also my low back. I have not worn any bottoms for weeks. I wear a night gown and usually walk holding it up so it does not brush anything. I found topical lidocaine worked on one part of my leg but stung like hell on another part. I feel stuck just waiting
2074,Shingles at 35: I have not gotten the shot. I have read positive and also negative feedback about it. I was diagnosed with shingles at 36 2 days after what felt like the flu. Large band aids or gauze and tape are comforting when blisters open. Cold showers and ice packs helped me. Edibles helped me get past the nerve tingle and able to sleep. Lots of sleep was absolutely necessary.
2075,I just took my very first dose of 2.5. I heard the first click and then the second click about a second later. The gray plunger was clearly visible. I saw the tiniest spot of blood. No pain. So that was it? No discomfort? Did I actually inject it correctly??
2079,Shingles vaccine: I Have had shingles twice. My doctor recommended I take the vaccine about 8 years ago. Lucky me I Am highly allergic to it. In and out of the hospital for a week. Cannot remember a time I was that ill. Would rather have shingles. But mine was not a typical reaction.
2082,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: Thank you! I have been taking it a little earlier each evening, so we shall see if that helps. I always have appreciated being able to sleep straight through the night! Makes me realize just how much trouble I was having with sleep before."
2090,I just got diagnosed as having shingles by a doctor and put on antivirals. In so much pain right now feels like the worst sunburn ever combined with someone sitting on my ribs. No rash yet day 3 of symptoms day 1 of anti virals and praying it does not blister or rash. My question is How many people here NEVER had chickenpox were vaccinated for it in the childhood vaccine schedule and now have shingles? And what is your age? I am 27 f from the USA and was shocked to hear I had shingles. My parents told me they got me vaccinated because they were told this would keep me from getting shingles and I distinctly remember other children at my school catching chicken pox but I never did and was upset that I did not get time off from school . Now I am deep diving
2092,41 and got Shingles: My wife and I both got them when we turned 40. A couple of my friends did as well. Really sucked. Could Not sleep for a couple of days and the pain meds made me sick so I had to just ride it out with Tylenol.
2093,Vulvar shingles at 15dpo: Yes I Am sure. Its shingles. Got the lab results this morning. I guess I should have rethought waiting I. The Shingles vaccine. The nerve pain is now radiating around my left buttock.
2097,Shingles vaccine experience: I was nervous about the shingles shot but I can barely remember any side effects. I think my arm was a bit sore. I had chicken pox in my 20s. It was miserable
2098,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: It made my whole body feel like I got beat all over with a baseball bat.
2100,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: And shingles is a big deal. It can because permanent and excruciating neuropathy and pain. It can because bad scarring. Some people get it in their eyes and become blinded and others become deaf in one ear. God forbid you end up with cancer or some other disease causing immunodeficiency and your ENTIRE body erupts in shingles. I had a patient with leukemia and his entire face was just a shingles crust like half an inch thick. His entire face It was gruesome to look at because he looked like his face was burned off and it was horribly painful. Whenever he would try to move his face the crust would crack and ooze. Even once they had hopefully cleared his shingles he would be horribly deformed and scarred. Shingles can because pneumonia liver failure damage to your spinal cord. And it is fatal in 1 out of 1000 cases in older adults. So yeah Trisha will not even call her grandma she does not deserve it set a baby up for potentially gruesome complications in life ON PURPOSE. Fuck Trisha. She honestly should be criminally charged.
2104,"Those who got the flu shot... did you experience any side effects?: I recently got my flu shot and within a few days, I developed a low-grade fever and body aches. I was feeling under the weather for about a week. Has anyone else had a similar experience after getting the flu shot? I'm curious to know if these side effects are common or if it's just my body's reaction."
2106,Shingles and other Vaccines: I was diagnosed with SLE about 2 weeks after I received the shingrix vaccine. I guess the immune booster in the vaccine boosted my immune system a little too much.
2107,RVS vaccine. Anyone know much about it ? Ty: Its actually a preventive antibody treatment and not technically a vaccine a vaccine stimulates antibody production in this case the antibodies are given directly. RSV can be severe in infants. Based on your infants ageweight they give a different amount. We decided to give it to our daughter last winter before traveling. She was 11 weeks at the time. We made a special appointment with our pediatrician specifically for this.
2109,Definitely agree. Hard vaccine to handle but much better than getting the shingles. My second was not quite as bad if that helps.
2110,Shingles with an infant?: I am in the same boat. I am on day 3 of the rash and have a 6 month old. Thankful to read these positive comments
2111,Am I a bad person?: I had shingles in the exact same area the exact area I sleep on. No matter how much I tried to sleep on my back or left side I would wake up every other hour when I tried to roll over. I do not think I slept for more than 2 hours for 2 months
2115,Apparently it is terrifying that pregnant women are not getting boosted during their pregnancies...: Right?? Know what else would be devastating? Losing a pregnancy because you chose to get a vaccine that does not do anything for CviD prevent spread or from getting it but has caused miscarriage WHY risk it? Their line of thinking gives me a headache. Like my statistics professor says STOP over thinking it just is what is.... I still need excedrine mid class just like I do after reading too many of these Matter of fact.... Also my otherwise healthy but broke her ankle neighbor had to go to the hospital etc.. And needs surgery to set something or pin something in her ankle now and had to get the CviD and flu vx... She got them both at the same time. She felt funny all day and her friend ended up staying over to help her in case she got dizzy or something... She woke up in the middle of the night feeling weird so she was going to go to the bathroom. She stood up and her legs or leg she uses crutches because of the ankle did not work. She also found she could not talk. could not even call out to her friend so she had to call 911 hoped they would locate her because she could not speak. She said in her mind she was thinking the right words but they would not come out... Scary af.. She had a stroke Luckily dispatcher found her sent cops and she banged on the outside wall to let them know where she was... Which woke her friend finally lol... She was OK but her Dr specifically said it was because you are not supposed to get the Cvd flu at the same time. This happened last month. Last week I was picking up my teen sons fav deodorant at Walgreens the announcements playing? Get your Cvd flu vaccine and they conveniently give them at the same time I was like WTF?
2116,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had shingles when I was 40. Some of the worst pain I Have experienced It felt like my nerve endings were popping with pain. The vaccine sucks but I Am so glad it exists.
2118,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: I Am 47 and I Have had shingles going on 3 times.. first was when I was 32 lost my hearing in my left ear. Insurance still will not cover the shot. Out of pocket is 400.
2122,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My first shot took me 2-3 days to get over. The second one was a breeze so hopefully that works for you too. I know it's annoying but I've known people who've had Shingles and they say it's just awful.
2125,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: You and me both. My husband has it on the side of his head and face and its awful. Going on 3 years since he had shingles so it can last a long time.
2128,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: Oh noooo Yes asthma will do it... a quick search says 70 more likely to develop outbreaks if you have it. One pro tip i reaearched was to avois foods with argenine And up your LLysine My wifr has cold sores. I have her take 1000mg lysine a day and within 2 months cold sores basically reduced from 12 per month to 1 per year Argenine feeds shingles n cold sores lysine is the counter to it and lowers argenine. Hope it helps In addition to taking lysine and reducing argenine high foods look into chelated zinc 25mg chelated means its pre digested form so easier to break down n absorb in intestines and a good liposomal 24hr vitamin c pill. Liposomal means its fat soluble.... breaking it down over 24hrs is much better Zinc and C are amazing boosters for immune system. I think adding chia seeds triggered my flareup. I had not had shingles did big doses of chia seeds daily for a week and bam Chia is high in argenine.. it was so bad all over groin and every other private part.... i just laid.moaning from the pain for over a week. It swelled my nerves so badly i could not go to the bathroom 1 or 2 consistently for 3 weeks Thank you
2132,I have had lifelong issues with seasonal allergies and seriouschronic contact allergies and eczema since about age 35. I have multiple diagnosed contact allergies and as a result I only use a very short list of fragrance free products on my skin and anything that touches my skin. Despite this I experience pretty consistent flares of eczema and recently larger systemicseeming rashes. I had one of these larger systemic flares right before Christmas and I was already set to see a dermatologist on the 3rd for a followup on alopecia areata treatment that is a new fun skin thing I am recently dealing with. I sent pics to the derm but by the time I saw her the rash had cleared. She said looking at the pictures it did not look like eczema and my description of the rash was not consistent with hives. She said she did not think it was autoimmune related either since those rashes apparently do not resolve quickly I had my rash for about 34 days and it was resolved by taking hydroxyzine and applying topical steroids. What could because a rash like this? Images The derm recommended I see my primary care doctor but I am not sure what there would really be to diagnose without an active rash going on. Other symptoms I experience constant headaches fatigue joint pain periodic issues with numb hands and arms during sleep heartburn alcohol intolerance and GI issues have been gluten free for 10 years but still have issues. Also have a persistently swollen lymph gland in armpit that I have mentioned to multiple docs before but no one has seemed concerned about that. I also have Reynaud's and have had trouble with wounds that do not want to heal on my legs. Also have some spots of prurigo nodularis on ankles and legs. Other info Age 52 female. Had Chickenpox as a child and already had both doses of the shingles vaccine. Fully vaccinated for COVID. Meds daily Buproprion XL 150mg 1xday. Prescribed 4000 iu of Vitamin D daily for deficiency. Many additional topicals to be used as needed for eczema.
2133,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: The moment the vaccine came out Juneish 2023 I vaccinated both my kids the first is now 4 and the second is 20 months. My kids have a very low key reaction to RSV extreme congestion and malaise with a low fever but I did it for herd immunity for the class because when my 4 year old went through his first round of RSV hes had it 3 times post covid lockdown in my city was brutal for babytoddler sickness half his class of 12 needed to be hospitalized or otherwise go to urgent care for treatment. Its given me enormous peace of mind now in my third pregnancy that neither is likely to get it this season there is an estimated but unproven 2 year horizon on immunity which means I am also unlikely to get it. And Ill keep getting all my kids vaccinated as recommended by my pede. Ill also get the vaccine myself on schedule per my OBs direction. As far as vaccine response goes it was pretty easy for both of them one gets responses the other is a tank and in my book totally TOTALLY worth it. Do what your pede recommends make them be honest a lot of pedes have to soft shoe around vaccine recommendations because parents can get very agitated with firm recommendations but Id say for sure vaccinate your older child AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
2136,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Yeah I have had it twice and one of the bumps was inside my left eye corner that was annoying lol
2138,Shingles vaccine: I have exceedingly low tolerance for meds and tons of allergies. I got both shots and never even had a sore arm. I had chicken pox as a child and this two series shot is absolutely necessary. I guess shingles are miserable and so very painful plus you can scar from them as well. Get THESE shots with confidence. As an addendum I never got the C shots..
2141,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I 46F remember my cousins coming to stay with us when my sister and I had the chicken pox. I also know how horrible shingles were for my grandfather. It was the only time I had ever seen him walking around his house shirtless. He said even the softest fabric against his skin was unbearable. My son 25M was vaccinated as a baby. My doctor warned that it was possible for him to get a mild rash from the vaccine and that if he did he would be contagious while the rash was visible. My mother had chicken pox as a kid but she had just gone through chemo and radiation for breast cancer. My son's rash consisted of a single little bump so we missed it. Due to her cancer treatments my mom was no longer immune. The poor dear ended up with a horrible case of chicken pox. Even her bald head was covered with them. I felt horrible and my mom had been warned ahead of time. If someone intentionally exposed my child to any illness I would have their head I wonder if there could be legal repercussions? I mean what the MIL did borders on assault.
2143,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 88 got it very young. This year I had shingles twice First a long weekend or flulike symptoms all tests positive for anything and was so weak I needed to be picked up from urgent care.. it was hell After that ended developed a rash on my belly that had been tingling during the onset. My coworker saw me put a bandage on it and told me that is shingles. Go back to the urgent care and thank god she did. It did not get as bad as it may have. But it hurt love some camphormenthol rub I had china gel. Would think it would hurt but it soothed me
2146,Shingles vaccine: My dad had shingles on his face it followed the trigeminal nerve I believe. He was in so much pain for months. He made several visits to the dentist convinced he had a tooth abscess it was shingles. I remember him telling me he could not even describe the pain.
2151,I had a co worker sick twice with flu like symptoms after getting shingles vaccine. 2 I told her to stay away from me and she was pissed.
2156,Humira gave me shingles: Taking Taltz triggered pulmonary sarcoidosis for me. My lung specialist says I Am the right age for this to happen anyways but it was a same day as injection kind of thing. Just started coughing and it got worse swollen lymph in the lungs and eventually had to take a steroid inhaler. Its basically in rheumission now since I stopped taking Taltz.
2157,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: My Mom 65 happened to actually have shingles diagnosed about 6 months before my rash. Hers did blister up. They were gnarly looking. My rash was not as dark as hers was. It did not happen on both shoulder blades simultaneously either. Who knows what it was. It itched burned hurt like hell and sucked to have for about 3 months. Then it just disappeared.
2159,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Sore arm for couple days was all. Two people in my office had active shingles this year and I did not contract it so the vaccine was effective in my opinion
2160,RSV vaccine Abryso because: ON I got mine early Oct as my baby was due November and the doctors did not know if he would be given the vaccine right after birth. My midwife provided the prescription and i paid 300 out of pocket. My baby arrived early less than 2 weeks after i had the vaccine so we had to vaccine him again. Unfortunately he caught RSV from his older brother just before the vaccine and it was so bad we went to ER twice. They could not do anything for him so just let it run its course and he got better after 2 weeks. My vaccine no side effects bit of a stiff arm. His vaccine its not a vaccine but an antibodies shot so no side effects that i could see.
2161,Shingles vaccine: No matter how miserable the vaccine makes me feel I can guarantee it will not be as bad as that time I got shingles. A day or two of feeling unwell is way better than weeks of pain and general malaise.
2163,How to keep NICU baby safe from illnesses after discharge?: We had masks and hand sanitizer at the door and limited visitors for the first three months she was born. At 6 months she got the RSV and flu vaccines so we were a little less cautions but still do not bring her to super crowded areas this time of year currently 7 months actual
2165,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Just had one and can concur. The actual procedure lasted less than the blink of my eye :-) The prep was \*interesting\*"
2167,"Why does it take one week for the body to feel the effects of the varicella vaccine? (M) 25 yrs old: Genuinely curious. About to go into the last couple of semesters for nursing school and for the varicella vaccines I usually don't feel the side effects until one week after the injection. Had the second dose 6 days ago and now my arms feel like they are gonna fall off, and feel kind of feverish (just as I did with the first dose for one day). I already have a BS in biology, I did some research but cannot find the answer. Thanks!"
2169,Have taken both doses of the shingles vaccine with no reactions.
2170,My son was 27 when he got a severe case of Shingles near his eye. Doctors thought he might lose his vision. I was always on the fence about getting the vaccine but after his episode I finally did it It kicked my ass and I paid outofpocket for the vaccine and Id do it again
2172,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never caught chickenpox even when my siblings had it. I was told I was immune when I was a kid so i do not know. I did not get the chickenpox vaccine until I was an adult trying to get into nursing school. I have seen a lot of patients have some super inconvenient repercussions from shingles like blindness and chronic painneuropathy type symptoms. So I guess I can count myself lucky in that way. I am also looking at the hpv vaccine. That Is another vaccination that I did not get because it did not exist and then I was too old for it when it did exist but they kept bumping the age back and now I am wondering if I should get it even though I am pushing 40.
2175,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I also get gout but this hurts worse than gout. it is shocking how bad shingles hurt. Nothing I have heard about it prepared me.
2177,I would take the Be hit by a truck than the side effects of shingles. I was scheduled to get my vaccine on a Friday so I could recover over the weekend and came down with shingles on Monday. I had residual side effects for more than 18 months.
2183,41 and got Shingles: I Am 46. I had mild shingles 3x in the past 68??years. First time it was a small patch on my back second time a patch on my thigh third time my forearm. I also have an autoimmune disorder and I get cold sores about 4x a year. If its all related
2188,"Finally out of my flare, loving rinvoq more than I should as it isn't a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: In my small pea sized brain I really didn't think I would get shingles. I'll likely pay cash for the vaccine once it clears so I dont have it again"
2190,A roofer with shingles. How ironic...: Probably around 35 hours since first sight of rash. Ya we have the same doctor and she strongly recommended he get it. Was worried for him because he just got the measles mumps and rubella vaccine and got a fever and cough that lasted several days. First day of no fever and he got another shot.
2191,Shingles vaccine: I had no reaction at all to either Shingles vaccine. I did have Shingles in my 40s and it was horrible. If you are worried about a reaction Id schedule the vaccine over a weekend when you do not have plans. Most reactions are gone after 24 hours. I would not take a chance of ruining Thanksgiving. Maybe schedule for Friday after in the morning?
2192,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine You do NOT want shingles. My husband had a super mild case and was in real pain. Awful.
2193,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Oh honey I Am so sorry this is happening to you. When I had shingles on my left flank back in April I was taking 3 Advil every 6 hours. On days 46 I added two 4mg prednisolone to the Advil at night because Advil alone did not have enuf antiinflammatory effect. During the second week I did a full burst and taper prednisolone pack. I never did take gabapentin. If I were you Id ask the doc if you can do a steroid taper of prednisolone. Note that prednisolone is the lighter version of straight prednisone which can make you very jittery made me feel like I was losing my mind in anxiety. I always ask for SOLU Medrol prednisolone. Also flexible ice packs helped. Sending healing thoughts.
2194,"Shingrix vaccine-Anyone get it? How did you feel?: So I am turning 55 this year. I am eligible for the shingrix vaccine. I usually don't react to vaccines. I had the original shingles vaccine with no reaction. I keep reading horror stories about reactions to this vaccine but I don't want shingles! So those who have had the vaccine, how did you feel and how did you deal with it? Thanks for any info."
2200,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: YEP. I had chicken pox twice as a kid. When I was 24 I was working in a newsroom and stressed all the time. One day my forehead develops a large red swollen bump. It looks like I ran head first into a door. It feels like Voldemort coming back to life using my skin. Its pulsing and making me dizzy. I immediately go to Urgent Care where I Am told I Am too young for it to be shingles and that it was a noncontagious rash. So I was cleared to work the following day. Where I interviewed a pregnant woman and spent the day with seniors at a nursing home. My head throbbing I was sweating the whole time. I still feel terrible this happened but I was booked for a shoot and given the clearance to work Two days later its not going away so I go to a dermatologist who takes one look and says shingles. Had to go to the eye doctor because the rash was close to my eye. Shingles can make you go blind if the virus gets too close to your eyes. Its no joke
2202,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had them when I was 26. Absolutely awful. I have a scars on my back chest from the rash. I thought I was dying ended up in the et. They said it was too advanced for antibiotics to really do any good but they would give a script if i wanted it would have like been 500 pre Obamacare.
2210,Dr Markis my daughter has been diagnosed with a fatty liver she does not drink what I read is that it can be cancer. She is vaccinated and had shingles in her sinuses. What can help her
2213,Shingles vaccine: I got a bunch of vaccines at once in 20 the day after major surgery. Not sure why but I was pretty gorked out with pain meds So far no shingles.
2217,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got shingles at 40. I had a baby at the time who was not through her vaccine schedule for varicella yet so I had to be extremely careful when I held her. After getting COVID last year my nerve pain came back for a few weeks. Wild.
2218,"Cimetidine (Tagamet) for shingles FAQ: Posting this because cimetidine had a dramatic effect on [my own shingles](<url>), basically the blisters noticeably improved after 24 hours and eventually disappeared, and the pain mostly went away. I ended up with no PHN either."
2221,Shingles vaccine question: Got my shot yesterday. I took today off and with the holiday on Monday I figured that would be a good amount of time to recover. I feel totally fine though I expected to feel like death warmed over. I took a piece of advice I read here or another subreddit move your arm like crazy after the shot for like 20 minutes and then whenever you think of it throughout the rest of the day. I was a boxer. I was a windmill. I was a tennis player. I was a cheerleader. I was a weightlifter doing deltoid raises. I just kept it moving even while driving home. And I have virtually no soreness this morning
2227,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My son had the vaccine as a toddler. He has gotten shingles twice. Once at four and then at eleven.
2229,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Its not odd. It just varies. Sometimes people just get a rash on their side. It just depends how bad it gets and where. But just because it was not bad once does not mean it always will be. I had it all over the back of my head and the side of my face. I was pretty run down for 23 days but for me the worst part was I had this wild shooting pain in my spine in my neck that would ping every 5 seconds for a week and made it impossible to concentrate.
2230,Hello all I stopped checking this long covid sub sometime around the summer of 2023 because there were an influx of toxic people who thought covid or lc was not a thing. I was debilitatingly sick from POTS and CFS and I did not have the energy to welcome such negativity to my life. I got Covid back in December 2022 and was able to recover from the active covid infection in February 2023. I was diagnosed with long covid sometime around January 2023. And I was transferred to a long covid clinic in Tokyo in August after having POTSCFS symptoms since April. Spent the month of May getting extensive tests done at a big hospital to rule out any other serious disease. I was housebound on most days during summer and finally started to show signs of improvement around November. I got so well to the point I even started going back to the gym I think having a support system and understanding family members helped me not have as many crashes as people who have no other options. We also have long covid clinics here in Japan where I went to seek help. My body never returned to its original fitness levels but my tolerance for mental and physical exertion noticeably improved. Finally I decided to fly back home from Japan to visit my family who were understandably very concerned about my health situation. .then I got covid again during this trip which was in February. In my country covid influenza and RSV viruses are all marked under the flu category and public hospitals do not even offer a covid test anymore. I got tested positive in a private clinic and I started crying when I received the news while the doctor assured me the new variant is not as bad as before. Before my diagnosis I had come in contact with family members and friends hugged and had close physical contact luckily none got sick except my best friend and her husband. Who recovered shortly after. I was sick for a month. And now my symptoms came back again. I Am not as disabled as before but my progress was halted and now I have mild CFS symptoms again. My blood test also shows low levels of T cells and WBC I Am genuinely worried about that. I wonder if anyone has a similar story. Thanks for reading
2231,I Am into week 7 had my 3rd dose of 5mg on Friday am losing a steady 1kg 2.2 pounds a week and I think my body is unhappy because I Have got shingles and nothing else in my life is particularly stressful. I have heard elsewhere that people have weight loss sideeffects like hair loss as opposed to medication side effects. Anyone else having weightlossbodyshockstress side effects?
2233,I am 58f and trying to figure out if the vaginal estradiol I use once a week and the pills I take twice a week are enough to trigger herpes simplex outbreak. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge about this? I am now breaking out once a month with tiny blisters in an arc on the right side of my butt. They are not painful what is painful is the nerve painbefore during and after it lingers for weeks. They do itch and burn. Long been told this was shingleszoster but a recent pcr swab is positive for hsv2. Asking my partner he says I have had this for years but not like this constant reoccurring. This just sucks and I am thinking I will quit the estradiol and see if the break outs stop. Been with him for 36 years and he says he does not have it at all. First got it on my arm when I was pregnant. Few years later it started appearing on my butt. Can a person have shingles in one place and hsv2 in another? I am guessing a pcr swab will not be positive for hsv2 if it is zoster? I have started lysine and notice no difference. I have Vacyclovir but hesitant to take it as it bothers my kidneys and I did try one whole month of suppressive therapy and it seemed to have made this worse
2234,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I had shingles in my 20s. It sucked more than I care to describe. I do not want it again. My doctor recommended the shingles vaccine. I got the shingles and pneumonia vaccines at the same time. No problems except the second shingles shot hurt more.
2238,Shingles vaccine experience: Few years back I developed shingles . Thankfully the breakout was on my back I did read the stories about it after I was diagnosed and its some scary shit  . It was odd as it was just a never ending back pain and a slight burning sensation and I figured I just pulled a muscle but after it did not go away I went to a doc . Soon as I pulled up my shirt he knew right away
2243,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I was there for my covid and flu shot a couple of days after my 50th and they offered me the shingles shot at the same time and I was like Yes please. I was down from Friday night until Monday morning but it was totally worth it to have protection against the shingles. I did not get the chicken pox until I was 22 3 months after the vaccine for that came out I was not aware there was a vaccine at that time. It was a bad case. I wanted nothing to do with shingles lol.
2251,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I just had the shingles 2 weeks ago I am 33. My identical twin just got the vaccine so he would not need to go through it. I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I can.
2252,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My grandmother had it several times in increasing lengths as she got older to the point of hospitalization the last few times. I just turned 50 a week ago and this is a good reminder. But its going to have to be timed just right. I cannot screw up my holidays w that 2nd shot. lol
2253,Had the second shingles shot: I got sicker than two bums fucking in dumpster behind a Chinese Seafood restaurant.
2254,Hi 44F. I was diagnosed with Mnires disease in 2016. Mnires disease is a rare inner ear disorder that affects hearing and balance. My symptoms are vertigo migraines tinnitus hearing loss nausea vomitting nystagmus tingling in lips and finger tips neck and lower back pain. I Have had ct scans MRI lab work etc. everything comes back normal yet I can barely function .. not knowing from day to day what symptoms are going to be dominant that day. After reading all these years about potential causes of Mnires disease it does not run in my family I personally think my issues might have to do with the Shingles. I Have been getting Shingles on my face for years now. The first time was working at a doctors office with a lot of elderly patients with shingles. This was around 2010 I developed a shingles cluster to the right of my nose 8th cranial nerve I Have been told and its come back many times over the years always on the right side of my face andor right ear. The shingles rash cleared up and I did not seem to have lingering side effects from it and did not have any trouble with it for a few years. Around 2016 is when out of nowhere I started with terrible migraines confusion lethargy then loud tinnitis on the right which quickly progressed to hearing loss. They ruled out acoustic schwanoma and diagnosed me with Mnires disease. Almost 8 years later now I Have lost hearing in both ears. I still have loud tinnitis in both ears. I started wearing hearing aids 6 months ago. Not knowing the because of my Mnires disease I Have read and tried whatever I could find over the years Different diets John of Ohio vitamin regimen chiropractors neuromuscular dentist massage acupuncture European medications etc Does anybody else have any experience with shingles permanent hearing loss? Has anybody been on an antiviral for extended period of time to help with symptoms? Any info or suggestions are appreciated Thanks for reading
2256,Please Help: I am sorry you are hurting so badly It sounds like disc issues maybe flared up by the shingles. Sciatica is the worst I know the feeling of wanting to cut that leg off
2258,I got the original shingles vaccine which was pulled from the market due to many reports of adverse side effects. I had no problems with it. No side effects and I did not even have a sore arm after getting the shot.
2259,PHN: I have had shingles three times on my face in the last three years. I had a stroke a few days after the most recent episode. Apparently shingles above the eye is associated with increased risk of strokes. I got the shingles vaccine in the spring after my second episode of shingles caused phn in my ear and eye. Then in October I had shingles again. I am currently taking valacyclovir 500 mg once a day to try to prevent future outbreaks. I have had a headache in the affected area since October and had to increase my gabapentin. I am taking alpha lipoic acid because I have had good results with it for neuropathy after leg surgery. It took quite a while to help with that probably several years but I feel like it was beneficial.
2260,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Unfortunately my toddler got shinglesvery mild as well. Apparently it happens every now and then between the 1st and 2nd vaccine doses.
2261,I got COVID flu and 1st shingles at the same time. I was a little puny for about a day. Got 2nd shingles all by itself and it knocked me down for a day. I have heard how painful shingles is so I will take the vaccine reaction over that thankyouverymuch
2264,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: If anyone thinks their something when they are not deceives themselves
2265,Second Shingles Shot: Yep No issues after the second shot. Highly recommend. One of my friends got shingles and wound up hospitalized.
2269,First time on MTX injections. Is 15 mg low? I forgot to ask my rheumatologist. Also she says at 2 months it should be kicking in but I read a lot here how it took 3 months. I did have an ongoing flare from the shingles vaccine and missed a dose because of strep. I feel a little less pain areas around the joints more flexibility but its very subtle. Also on plaquenil. She raised it to 25 mg. Is that the max? I Am seronegative. Thanks
2273,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I had shingles 5 years ago when I was 52. I had never even considered getting a shingles vaccine but I wish I had. That ranks in the top 5 worst experiences for me with kidney stones covid breaking my jaw when I was 6 included. Having it was terrible but even worse is that I still have nerve pain to this day. I get shooting pains down my legs and into my toes yes it is nerve pain caused by the shingles I checked with my doctor like an electrical shock. It is sudden and very painful. It is not all the time but it happens many times a day. Get your shingles shot.
2275,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had them on my face and inside my mouth....I was 22 years old worst pain I have ever experienced to this day. Yes I got the shingles vaccine. I still have scars on my face from them and strange tingle sensations at the scar sites.
2277,This shit is painful. Debilitating ly so. It s also preventable. So learn from my mistake. Get your vaccine.
2278,Bit of a long one here. There Is a lot of history but I Am trying to condense as much as possible. TLDR I have a recurring skin thing rash lesion i do not know that always comes up in the same location. Used to show up every 18 months or so but has been dormant for 67 years. Last time the suspected because was shingles but I got in too late for it to be tested. Okay so additional context. History I Have been having this since my midlate teens. My mom RIGHT NOW always told me it was just sun poisoning and not to worry about it. But often it occurred even without sun exposure. I Have since cut contact with my mother due to among other things medical neglectabuse. I finally got an actual doctors opinion when pregnant with my son. Hell be 7 in May so that is where I got the timeframe. At that doctors visit I was unable to get in before the fluiddrainage had dried up. Doc took one look said that looks like shingles with surprise and got a more experienced doctor to double check. He agreed but they said that due to the liquid being dried upgone that it could not be confirmed. Developments since then diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa had a premelanoma removed not long after the last eruption and had yearly skin checks since ASDPFO in heart discovered and repaired developed severe allergy to adhesives yes including paper tape  even surgical glue  I can only use hydrocolloid bandages determined to be at high risk for cancer and receiving twice yearly imaging had another baby almost 1 year ago repeated bloodwork shows elevated inflammatory markers but the because is undetermined SymptomsCharacteristics always in the exact same location never had it anywhere else starts with a mild itching and small bumps you can feel but not see roughly the size of a US nickel progresses quickly overnight to a larger slightly swollen area that is hot to the touch and includes what looks like blisters filled with clear fluid grows more painfulirritatingitchy but never bad enough that I need to take a Tylenol sensitive to touch makes it impossible to wear a bra and difficult to wear a shirt typically is fully gone in 710 days does not leave a scar Demographics almost 32 female no daily medications Current state approx 24 hours after first sign My main concern is that due to an insurance change I may not be able to get into a primary or dermatologist before the situation resolves itself. Should I go to a walkin or urgent care instead? My partners main concern is that it might be a spider bite but I figure it would be one hell of a coincidence if I had a spider bite in the exact same location as these previous eruptions. UPDATE I have OCD and with an infant too young to be vaccinated against chickenpox I could not stop obsessing and went to the ER. It is shingles and I was prescribed valacyclovir and prednisone. Advised to practice good hygiene keep area covered and keep baby away from the area. We also reached out via patient portal to her pediatrician to make sure there are no additional instructions. Baby girl is WEEKS shy of the youngest vaccination age which breaks my heart.
2280,Update on my previous post: this is the stuff of nightmares. i am heartbroken for your wife and her loved ones. i am really at a loss for words. i had shingles on my face after chemo and it was one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. the human body is a cage. i am so sorry for your loss there are no words to convey how sorry i really am. life is so unfair. may the good memories sustain you
2281,Shingles after covid: I am so sorry you got shingles. My SO got it right after covid and it was painful as hell. We since got vaccinated against it.
2282,Shingles vaccine experience: I recently had shingles before the age of 50 and will admit it was not pleasant. I am an immunologist so I recognized the pattern of the rash that it was more than likely shingles. The nerve pain can be very irritating when doing life activities and even after the rash has healed there was lingering tingling effects. I highly recommend getting the vaccination when you can. Right now they make you wait till 50 yrs of age.
2287,Shingles vaccine: Very sore arm not really anything else. Got the Shingrx vaccine about 3 years ago right after I turned 50. My SIL has had repeated shingles and that was incentive enough for me.
2289,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: You can still get shingles if you had the chickenpox vaccine. It is a live vaccine so you still may have that virus lingering. I know several who have had the vaccine and got shingles including 2 as teenagers. It also seems more likely that you will get shingles if you had a mild case of chicken pox or had it when you were younger than 4. That was the case for my brother who had it at 3 and husband who had 2 mild infections. Both had pretty bad shingles cases.
2291,RSV vaccine?: Yes my baby got it on Monday with her other 4 month shots. She gets every shot available. I have seen firsthand how devastating RSV can be to a baby. I refuse to take that chance with my daughter.
2295,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I currently am recovering from shingles. Sunday will be 8 weeks since my first symptom started headache that led to going to the ER for an MRI before my rash started almost a full week later. It got into my eye which was swollen shut for a while then difficult to keep open due to the inflammation swollenness and light sensitivity. I did not go into the office for 5.5 weeks. Although I am feeling tons better I still have some numbness and occasional nerve pain. My eye is about half open and it is possible my partially dilated pupil will never recover according to my eye doctor it is not really bothersome so not complaining but its frustrating knowing this shit may have permanently affected me. I am grateful though my vision is OK. It could be so much worse considering how long it took to get diagnosed. I am going to beg for my vaccine when I am fully recovered. From what I have read mostly on reddit it is not promising I will get it before 50. It sucks. We spent a small fortune on medical bills plus general misery not working etc. I am 43 btw.
2297,Shingles vaccine: I just had the first shot and had nothing but a very mild soreness.
2301,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Can confirm had shingles a few weeks ago and one of the first things that hit me even before the rash is just random complete exhaustion out of nowhere. I Am 36 and healthy so it was super weird until the rash showed up
2302,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: Because I have bad reactions to vaccines my first bad reaction was as a baby. I cannot get flu shots or Covid boosters either. Its a really bad outcome with both for me. I Am only getting tetnus boosters without the other two things in it. My PCP and pain doc both have no issues with this.
2303,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Fatigue is definitely a shingles symptom
2304,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Everybody thought it was the part of the show.
2305,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I Am recovering from shingles. I Am just under 50 so did not have the shot yet. Its been a month and its almost healed. I got it on my hip and it affected my ability to pee What a nightmare even on the antivirals. Severe itching every night I thought I had torn a muscle in my leg at first and then the rash showed up. Felt like someone was sanding my sunburnt skin.
2306,"Does anyone have any supplement recommendations for preventing shingles?: I'm on my third bout of shingles in a year and a half and I'm 32... My doctors don't think I need to visit an immunologist yet, so I'm willing to give some preventative methods a shot. Has anything worked for you? I've seen some recommendations for Vitamin D and L-Lysine.."
2307,Getting my first Shingles shot today: My sister had shingles and it was terrible I ran not walked to get my vaccine. The shot is not that bad. You might be sore for a day or two. Much better than actually getting shingles
2308,Just took my first dose about 20 minutes ago. What should I expect today?: Took my first dose today too I do not feel any different for what its worth
2314,Hi everyone. I am here because I would love to know what is going on with my body. So I am 22 and just got diagnosed yesterday with shingles by my PCP. About a week ago I started feeling mildly crummy irritated throat body malaise etc but attributed it to the poor air quality in my area until a rash appeared on my chest three days ago. The rash started along my collarbone and stretched up towards my shoulder only on one side consisting of tight clusters of raised red bumps that were itchy. At first I assumed it was irritation or something but after it spread over the course of a day or two started stretching up over my shoulder and down towards my armpit I decided to go toy doctor yesterday. She took one look at it and diagnosed it as shingles. This was shocking to me as I have mentioned that I am only 22 which is ridiculously young to have this condition flare up. Regardless I accepted this news and have set about doing my best to take care of myself. My doctor prescribed me an antiviral and some Prednisone for the inflammation though I have only been able to start taking the steroids as the antiviral has not been ready for me to pick up from my pharmacy yet. So this morning the day after my diagnosis I wake up and my rash is almost entirely gone. It is far less red less raised and seems to have shrunk down a bit. I am shocked to see this as shingles outbreaks are supposed to last several weeks and blister bwfore they are done. I have taken a dose of Prednisone but somehow I am suspicious that it would be THIS affective against shingles. It is not gone yet or anything but it looks like it is on its way out after just a few days of being a rash and without even having blistered or crusted over. So I guess... Is this normal? Can shingles rashes kind of waver back and forth in severity over the course of an outbreak? Should I be expecting it to get worse again? Is it possible for it to clear up quickly and without blistering? Or have I been misdiagnosed? I wish I had taken a picture to share of when the rash was at its peak as it does not look very bad at all right now but I will attach a picture of how it looks currently anyway. It currently is far less raised red and spread out than it appeared to be yesterday.
2317,Shingles at 35: I am so sorry. What Is interesting to me is the first doctor I saw diagnosed shingles immediately when I did not even have a rash only nerve pain. I took a full course of antivirals and it turned out I did have the BS nerve compression from working out after all. Is Not that crazy how inconsistent doctors can be? Wth. At first I felt terrible I took all those pills without even having shingles but looking at the opposite perspective I feel like all doctors should go better safe than sorry and just prescribe them?
2318,Hi everyone I F20 Went to the doctor yesterday . He told me that I have Shingles. I have a rash on the left side of my face under my ear. The issue is there is another rash in the middle to the right of my neck. And now a new rash has appeared on my right under my ear. It has the same amount of pain and feels like a blow torch on my skin. I have blisters and am in pain. I was given cyclovex 400mg and stilpane. I have never had chickenpox before. I have been diagnosed with POTS MDD GAD with OCD. I am on Sertraline 50mg. I thought you could only get shingles on half of your body. Any help would be really appreciated
2319,Shingles vaccine?: I have gotten both versions. They both sucked but shingles sucked far worse. I got the first one at 35 and the second at 44 because the newer version is more effective. I will say the double smack one was far less annoying than the single older type. That older one made my RA MAD. I got a welt from my upper bicep into my elbow that itched like fire for 3 days. The newer split dose was far less itchy and achey.
2320,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: I was diagnosed with CIDP after the safe and effective COVID vaccine
2321,First 2 pictures are from Monday the next 2 are from Wednesday then Friday and again today. Google image search has me all over the place but I do NOT like how it looks and need to know how overprotective mom I should be without being that mom. No fever no pain no complaints other than itching. 7 years old with both chickenpox vaccines.
2324,Listen to your body not wishful thinking a cautionary tail: I had a similar thing happen when I started taking Wellbutrin years ago. I had only been on it a few days when I randomly got shingles lol.
2327,Realworld evidence from over one million COVID19 vaccinations is consistent with reactivation of the varicellazoster virus.  The risk of developing shingles was 0.20 for the vaccinated  0.11 for the unvaccinated. The difference was statistically highly significant P  0.0001.: No. I took the shots despite knowing the risk of myo card it is and thr ombo cyto peni a. But if I had started noticing signs and symptoms of those things post vaccination I would ve a recognized what it was and pursued treatment immediately and b not been horrified at landing at the hospital for something they didn t know or say could happen
2328,Shingles vaccine: I got the shingles vaccine a couple of years ago after my neighbor said she got them and said it was the worse experience being ill. The next day I went to Safeway and got the shot. Did not get ill or feel any effects. Now the Moderna Covid vaccine always made me ill the next day. This year I got Pfizer and no problems.
2330,Shingles vaccine: Had shingles at 11 years old. It was HELL very painful heat sensitive blisters. My doctor said I was more likely to get shingles again so I got the shots. No pain in my arm or side effects. Highly recommend.
2337,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: WOAH WOAH. I had shingles at 23. 23 It was INCREDIBLY painful and left scars on my right side. You. TAKE. That. SHOT.
2338,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 1988 caught it in 1992 at preschool and had a bad case. Never vaccinated for chicken pox. Got shingles at age 28 and I am still LIVID that docs will not allow me to get the shingles vaccine Apparently you can get it again and every time you get it gets worse. The younger you are getting shingles the more likely you are to get it again. I do not remember getting chicken pox but holy fuck was shingles terrible. I felt like I was being stabbed and tattooed and burned along the nerve.
2339,My roommate has been vaccinated 4 or 5 times this year and has had shingles twice.
2340,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: i went to see many friends with chicken pox. so did my sisters. none of us every contracted it. we got the vaccine when we could
2345,I 58F have these symptomsexperiences  latex allergy developed about 8 years ago. To band aids and rubber dam during root canal. Get red and itchy at site of contact. No other symptoms  periodic poison ivy extreme reaction misdiagnosed several times over several years by different doctors as shingles with welts all over body including where there was no actual contact.  Keflex a drug allergy that causes a rash on hands palms and feet soles  in summer 2022 and 2023 ingestion of 1220 raw cherries that causes stomach ache  in June 2023 I had the most severe poison ivy reaction of my life was misdiagnosed and in pain with face disfigured by swelling and welts until properly diagnosed at ER and given appropriate medication  two weeks later in June 2023 I ate about 10 maraschino cherries and other fruit and pizza and a Margaritaville mini margarita and woke up around 3 am with a hivehard spot on right cheek. The hive turned into facial and lip swelling that progressed down the right side and started going up the left side. It was hot and my lips were very swollen. No issue inside mouth or throat. Went to urgent care and got Benadryl shot and took Benadryl and Pepcid AC for two weeks. Face swelling reduced pretty immediately after the Benadryl shot.  no contact with latex or cherries since June 2023 and no further issues.  December 2024 blood test for cherry allergy is right in the middle of the normal range. I know those results can vary. Also prescription for two epi pens. Talking to someone with MCAS she supposes that the cherry digestion and face hive was histamine related. And that because I had the severe poison ivy reaction two weeks prior that the histamine reaction from the cherries pushed me over the edge to because the hiveswelling. Does this sound familiar to others experiences? I will continue to avoid eating cherries and promptly get any future poison ivy outbreak treated. My biggest concern is that another ingestion of cherries unknown to be in food could turn into anaphylaxis. But I would feel better if I knew this was unlikely unless I was already primed with histamine. Is this likely? Or is it all a crap shoot when it comes to how the body reacts?
2347,I am the same. I had a wicked reaction big red thick welt however decades earlier I had shingles twice on the same side of the body I got the vaccine. I also made the stupid mistake of moving medical texts the next day. DO NOTHING the day after these shots.
2349,Shingles vaccine: Please please get the vaccine. I got shingles before I turned 50 and could get the vaccine. It was the worst pain of my life. A dr misdiagnosed me and I almost lost my eyesight. My dermatologist saw my words on facebook and sent me the correct meds. She was on a vacation. It was near the side of my nose bridge and down my face. I got into an eye dr to make sure it was not in my eye and therefore going into my brain. The shots were nothing. I have two autoimmune diseases so I did very poorly on the couple of Covid shots I got. But shingles was fine.
2350,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick but my arm hurt for a week Definitely get it in your nondominant arm
2352,Gosh. My sympathies. I hope you can forgive as well. I did not heed the church's recommendation and instead prayed about it. I received confirmation that the shot would not protect me and that neither me nor my kids should get it. My wife got it due to work developed shingles.
2353,I Have had a very weird series of events happen over the past week. Mon Dec 9th I woke up with a fairly large hard bumpknot on my skull behind my left ear did not think much of it. By the next day the bump had grown and was causing this really uncomfortable pressure and terrible pain into my ear and up my head caused a migraine just did not feel right at all went to urgent care urgent care doc said he thinks its mastoiditis which is very serious and that I needed to go right to the ER. Went to ER and ER doc says he does not think its mastoiditis I have not been sick my ears are clear does a CT w  wo contrast and some basic blood work. Blood work is normal including wbc ct shows slight inflammation around my parotid salivary gland. Prescribed 875 Augmentin 2xday. Thurs I go to the dentist to rule out any teeth issues and talk about my parotid dentist does his own ct and Xrays no dental issues no swelling in my mouth nothing everything looks great. Now by Thurs I had a bubbly looking sore pop up on my forehead near my scalp that looked like a burn almost now I had dropped my hot brush on my head the day before although it hardly seems like it was that bad for the sore to look like it did but again did not think much of it and was putting Neosporin on it. By sat the sore had scabbed. I should also mention I do not feel like the antibiotics were helping really. Mon 16th my forehead started swelling but not around the scab below it above my eyebrow so much so you could press a finger into my forehead there and it would indent. All this has only been affecting the left side of my head. Called my reg doctor and she got me in yesterday. First look at me and what I thought was a burn and she said it looked like shingles to her but all my swelling is quite odd. Said the swelling behind my ear was lymph nodes. Not sure why I have swelling in my forehead. Explained that since its been over a week since the onset of symptoms and the sore is scabbed that antivirals will not work. Ran quite a bit of blood work Gave me a steroid shot for the swelling and prescribed me a medrol dose pack oral steroids. Woke up today overall feeling much better swelling behind my ear is down quite a bit swelling in my forehead only started to go down this evening but now I am feeling these weird burny tingling areasspots all over the left side of my face and head and even eyelid. If it is shingles which the sore really seems like it is could I develop more all over even after the one is scabbed and crusted and seemingly healing?? Has anyone else experienced swelling like this?
2355,Shingles vaccine: Sore arm maybe a nap nothing burger.
2356,I had both two weeks ago. No pain in either arm but the Shingles vaccine hurt a little in the pocket 220 2. But worth it I think.
2358,Is shingles vaccine for elderly who have had recent outbreak safe or risky. Literature confusing: I am suffering with PHN right now very severe but no rash and my doc told me I have to wait 1 yr before I get the vaccine
2365,Contrary to popular opinion I had the Shingrix vaccine yesterday had to be reminded this afternoon that it happened. No dead arm or rash or galloping consumption symptoms ... zip nada NIL. The key is ... DO NOT PANIC. Tensing during an injection ... the surest path to pain.
2366,30F shingles on the face: This is great for the itching. I got it from Amazon. I was diagnosed with Shingles the first of April. It was on my scalp forehead eyelid and side of my nose. It was not in my eye. It cleared up over a couple of weeks. Then a week after that my eye felt irritated and was red. My eye was very sensitive to light. Several days later I woke up that particular morning and the only thing I could see out of that eye were shapes. I had lost most all of the sight in that eye. I was horrified. I called an Ophthalmologist and they worked me in that day. He put me back on antiviral medication and prescribed a steroid eye drop. My sight returned pretty quickly after I started the eye drops. I Am on my last week of the eye drops and have an appointment to see the Ophthalmologist in a couple of weeks. I hope I get the all clear. I do not why it hit my eye after it had completely cleared up. It seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. Should you feel anything with your eye do not hesitate to see an Ophthalmologist.
2368,Shingles vaccine: I had the vaccine and other then some pain at injection site I had Nothing else. Neither did my husband
2372,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I was vaccinated. Diagnosed with shingles just over 3 weeks ago.
2374,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had it a few years ago across my back and chest and it was by far the worst pain I have ever experienced. My sister had it in her eyeball. I am not sure how she survived the pain. I have taken the vaccine.
2378,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Absolutely There is some chance you might get some uncomfortable at the injection site or feel under the weather for a couple of days. But boy oh boy do you not want full fledged shingles. I had chickenpox as a kid ands I do not have even the tiniest forgiving memory of it was hell. But I got shingles shortly after graduating college and it was miserable. It was all up my spine too so it was very difficult for me to treat or scratch or anything. Trust me you do not want it
2380,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I cannot stress this point enough. For the sake of your vision please see an ophthalmologist. I Am almost blind in my left eye from shingles. That Is because the shingles came in through the back of my eye but I Have lost most of my retina.
2381,Just found this subreddit and figured I would post. Just typing out my story somewhere and maybe seeing if others have had any similar experiences. So I never had chickenpox when I was a kid but my mom got me the vaccine pretty early on. Turns out it is rare but the vaccine developed into shingles years later when I was 7. I had it all around my vulva inner thigh genitals area. I am 30 now and luckily do not remember much about the feeling of pain and discomfort. It was not until college that I realized all my random nerve issues I would always had was probably from the shingles. It is not constant but about every week or so sometimes more often sometimes less a random part of my body will feel like it is been scratched and be super sensitive. Or my fingers or something will be tingly for a while. Anyway the whole thing just seems weird and a series of all the rare end of the spectrum things happening. It is hard to tell the extent to which it has affected me and I hope it does not come back. I am curious has anyone who had Shingles on their genitals experienced a lack of sexual desire after? Since that happened to me so young I think it caused me to have a disinterest in that part of my body so I did not explore physical desire for most of my young life. I am just extrapolating but it seems possible.
2384,"Worried About Contracting Varicella From Someone With Shingles: Age - 26 Sex - M Height - 5'11"" Weight - 170 lbs Race - Latino Duration of complaint - N/A Location - USA Any existing relevant medical issues - None Current medications - Daily probiotic My grandmother is living with me and has a case of shingles. She hasn't been very prudent with respect to sanitation and I recently discovered that she had handled several food items in the fridge. She has blisters on one of her hands. I'm worried I might develop varicella as a result. I received the MMRV vaccine as an infant, but I don't think I received a second dose. I'm still awaiting results regarding my varicella immunity status. Is this something I need to be concerned about? I don't want to end up ill and covered in scars. Thanks for any help."
2387,from the mRNA shot it is called shingles.
2390,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles just shy of turning 50. Awful. It is a unique kind of pain. Never experienced anything like it.
2391,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got vaccinated around 1998 or 99. I was 4 or 5. What year did the vaccine come out?
2392,I had in shingles in April and it was horrible. My mother got it in November she was booked in to get the vaccine the following week and she is still suffering debilitating nerve pain. Get the Vaccine
2394,One time I had a patient come and tell me she would had a terrible delayed reaction to the Shingles vaccine. Itchy rash. It seemed unlikely just because it had been almost a month since she would had the shingles vaccine. When after several weeks her rash did not improve she decided she was allergic to a new brand of naproxen we would started dispensing at the pharmacy I worked at. She was a nice lady and in order to be accommodating I ordered in the brand of naproxen she would had before. Another month or two passed and she came in again and I asked if her allergy had improved. She looked a little sheepish and said actually turns out we had bedbugs. Poor lady.
2395,"Health Anxiety has stopped me from getting vaxxed, but I'm sick of living my life in fear. Any encouragement and shared experiences would be appreciated: Im 26f and I haven't gotten any of the shots. I have horrible health anxiety, mainly with the fear that I'd be very sick and 1.it would never end or 2. I'd be alone and nobody would help me. I was on board with getting the vaccine when it first came out, I've had plenty of shots and never had adverse reactions, but then started seeing people around me knocked on their butts with strong immune responses, and I became more hesitant to sign up to deal with feeling like I have the flu myself. I don't have anyone I feel close enough to to ask them to come take care of me if I was sick. I had covid back in January and felt so alone. It just magnified that anxiety for me. So no matter how much I want to, I haven't been able to scrape up the courage to go get it. As more info comes out about mRNA vax I felt more hesitant to get it. It's so politicized, I can't talk to anyone in my life about it. I learned about novavax and decided I trust the traditional technology more. I've read about some experiences where people get zero response, while others get a day of a fever. I think I want to go for it, as I'm realizing how much I'm missing out on. It would be really helpful if y'all could respond with your experiences, particularly did taking Advil/Tylenol help with symptoms? What did you do to take care of yourself and get through it? How long did it last? Any encouragement would be helpful. I want to challenge myself to get it by the end of the year. Update: I worked up the nerve to call around and see who has novavax and make an appointment. One place said they have a walk in clinic happening today, so I decided to go get it while I have worked up the nerve. The actual shot was okay, but the rest of the experience sucked. The pharmacy tech asked me my personal info and vaccination status in front of a whole line or people. I felt so embarrassed and rushed and that made me feel more anxious. Can I just say, it's experiences like that that make me despise the social pressure, and want to make the decision on my own time even more. I'm never going back"
2400,reaction to monkeypoxsmallpox vaccine: The big huge impressive welt after MPXV is typical. If there is residual inflammation at the sites of the other vaccines and at 23 weeks there may well be it might kick it up there too.
2403,Here Is a breakdown of what I experienced day by day with shingles. I Have been under a lot of stress so how fitting shingles was added tot he recipe. Day 1 I noticed a tiny blister in my ear. It was not big at all but I noticed it when I put my headphones in which I had just gotten and assumed they were the culprit of the blister LOLOLOLOL Day 2 I had a field trip with my kids this day. Woke up early with a throbbing tooth pain. I immediately called my dentist and scheduled an appt after the field trip. The tooth pain worsens through the day. I noticed a stinging feeling in my jaw. Go to dentist explain symptoms she does xrays. I tell her I Am afraid it infected and accessing because the pain is spreading into my ear. I said what can we do to relieve this pain TODAY? She says we can extract it. But if its infected it may be hard to numb. We could do antibiotics and then extract if you want? The antibiotics will take the pain away as well So that is what I opted for. Although I came a hit away from just having it pulled. I started antibiotics Day 3. Continue antibiotics jaw is totally numb tooth pain is excruciating i noticed a small rash on my face kind of just looked like hives. Day 4 I wake up in agony. Face is on fire. Guns are swollen. Ear is throbbing nothing is easing the pain and I Am imagining this infection in my tooth is spreading to my brain. I go to ER where they give me lidocaine on a cotton ball and morphine as well as IV antibiotics. The lidocaine balls worsened the pain. The morphine did not even touch the pain. This was the indicator that something was up. Day 5 its a holiday and everyone is closed the rash turns to tiny blisters and is inside my mouth. The ear pain is unmatched shooting pain all day and all night. Unphased by any pain relief method. Day 6 I wake up at 4 and drive to the nearest dental urgent care hours away. I get there I Am seen they do more xrays they offered to do root canal or pull not 1 but 2 teeth. She ask about the rash on my face I said typically I have clear skin I Am assuming its from stress from my tooth? I do not know. I Am just in a lot of pain I Am in tears. The pain is throbbing in my face jaw gums teeth neck earits a pain I Have never felt and pray I never do again. Id rather have a natural delivery than feel this again. Finally a senior Dr comes in and says that looks like herpes zoster this was also at a medical schoolso he called lots of students in and used me as an educational lesson. Took pictures etc. here is the kicker he shows me my teeth crays and there is no infection. No reason to pull these teeth. Nothing wrong at all. He says I have no good reason to pulls these teeth Id almost say this tooth pain is 100 shingles I went that day to start a antiviral. Day 7 started antiviral still in pain water blisters are raging on my face. Blisters on my gums and inside my mouth in my ear and woke up super swollenthink like Jay Leno chin type swollen. My kid literally gagged when looking at my face. What is sleep? I go to urgent care to beg for a steroid shot. She give me something for nerve pain specifically. She looks in my ear and says it is covered in lesions and pressuring my ear drum. I was given a steroid and started the pain meds as well. Day 8 I woke up feeling like a new person just still ugly. The blisters are going down though. Still really swollen But still ugly nonetheless. I was in little pain with the correct medication. Although my ear was still stinging. Day 9 swelling started going down rash is subsiding. Pain is still prevalent Day 10 blisters have scabbed over. Face still numb but itchy if that makes sense? Blisters on gums and tongue are gone. Day 11 had trouble sleeping due to pain in ear. Rash is basically gone with the exception of a little bit of dry skin. Scalp is still very sensitive still hard to eat. I Am actually feeling a little defeated because I was told the pain would go away with the rash but that is not the case. The rash is basically gone but the pain is just as bad as day 1 it seems. TBC.
2406,I discovered this group seeking answers and supports after I was diagnosed with shingles and I must say it has been so helpful. Last Thursday I noticed a slightly raised area on my left cheek. It was sore but only at one spot. I thought it was some sort of Winter rash. Around the same time though I started getting some pains in my ear. Flash toward to Saturday and the pains are intense. I have a bad headache. The rash still looks normal but the entire left side of my face is on fire. It is like out of nowhere a pixie with an electric needle stabs me in my nerves. I feel it everywhere. I feel it in the rash. I feel it even in my teeth. But most of all I feel it in my ear. On Sunday I wake to find the rash is now angry and red. It is coated in an almost pus like sticky liquid. The pains are worse than ever. They almost bring me to my knees make my eyes water. The pain is inside my ear but the top of my ear by my side burns is itchy as hell. Rubbing it gives me relief but soon I look in the mirror and realize I have rubbed a giant sore so I stop doing that. By Sunday night I also have a terrible headache and flu like symptoms. My throat is a little sore. My lips are super chapped and a cold sore has formed on them. While I am not running a fever I feel like it. I have aches and pains in my joints and chills. In addition my hearing out of my painful ear feels off. Like when you get a little water in your ear. I do not sleep at all that night. The next morning I get up early to my doctor so I can be a walk in. He sees me and looks at the rash and in my ear and tells me I have shingles. I did have chicken pox when I was a kid. He says the virus is also in my ear because he can see rashes in there and my ear is severely inflamed. He is concerned I could lose my hearing. He prescribes me the maximum dose of Valtrex which is 1 gram. I do not think I have ever had a gram of any medicine in my life. He tells me to go get the prescription immediately and take the first dose immediately. It is 3 doses a day. It is now Thursday as I write this. The good news is the pain has reduced significantly. The rash on my face has begin to scab over and dry up. My ear feels better. I have regained some of my appetite which I lost for a few days partly because chewing food would send those shockwaves of pain everywhere. I have also finally been able to sleep. The bad news is it has been a terrible ride and I would not wish this on my worst enemy. Monday night which was my first day diagnoses and on the antiviral was the worst. I cannot even describe the pain. I had passed out on the couch out of pure exhaustion and when I woke up I was in bad shape. In addition to the unreal pain and the massive headache my eye felt heavy and when I looked in the mirror it was because under it on the same side as the rash it had swollen this may be a side effect of Valtrex. I was dizzy could barely walk and was hallucinating also possibly the Valtrex. I managed to literally crawl up the stairs and climb into bed and eventually passed out. I think the clock had said 4am when I went to sleep. I woke up at almost 4pm The good news was I felt significantly better but still had pain and it is continued to improve until now. I still have some swelling under my eye but it has went down some. I should also note I have had a kind of brain fog. It is been hard to focus on things or remember things. I tried to relax Tuesday might and watch a basketball game and I could not even really keep track of what was going on. It is like I could not focus. That seems to have mostly went away. Also no OTC pain killers worked. I tried them all and nothing put a dent in the pain. So that is my experience. Hopefully on the road to recovery. I am thankful that I had supportive friends through this had only one rash although the ear ones I could not see were awful even if it was in a terrible place and that I work for myself so the disruption to work impacted me minimally but still definitely has caused issues. To anyone dealing with this God speed. Once I get in the clear I am definitely looking into that shingles vaccine.
2411,It blows my mind that otherwiseintelligent people are still getting boosters A good friend successful lawyer recently got the latest booster flu shingles and RSV shots all the same day. He was bedridden for two weeks and ill for six additional weeks.
2415,shingles???: man i was vaccinated as a baby right before the regulation changed in canada for it to be two vaccines instead of one and i got an antibody test and i am not immune to chickenpox and cannot get the vaccine cuz i am on two immunosuppressants lmao i hate remembering cuz i am scared as hell i wish i did not know but i had to get it checked for my program
2418,Shingles vaccine experience: My experience with shingles were just awful. I came in contact with someone and I believe it was contagious because the person hugged me and the very next day I broke out. Weird right? My doctor said it is not contagious. Did I have stress going on in life sure. I believe they do not know everything at this point in my life. This happened 10 years ago. I was out of work for one month. Acupuncture was what made me get better so fast. I highly recommend it if you do get it. It was excruciating on my leg and back side. I could not move laid on the couch. At that time I was in my late 30s and I was able to get the old zoster vaccine which gave me side effects. When she looked at my chart the nurse who administered it asked if I was 60. No read my chart. People can get shingles at any age babies can get it. However healthcare waits until you are 60 to administer the vaccine Western medicine is strange. I have not had another bout of shingles though but I do have ongoing side effects.
2420,Shingles vaccine: My coworker got shingles at age 80 he was miserable and it took him months to recover. Its not just the rash he was extremely tired all the time. We also knew someone that had chronic shingles. After that my husband and I both got the Shingrex shot. I had a painful arm after each dose but no other symptoms or reactions.
2422,Initial stage before starting biologics.: You really want to get the vaccines they recommend. I was told I needed the shingles one but there was a shortage and I was too young so I was forced to miss out. I ended up getting shingles on my face and in my ear. It was like having white hot knitting needles stabbing me in the jaw for 5 days. The diseases we vaccinate for can have serious complications.
2423,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: Thanks for the advice. I hope all goes better for you too. It is hard as she is in her late 70s and not very active so it makes it worse for healing
2424,Just anecdotal but I got a suggestion to drink at least 8 oz of water before the shingles vaccine and I did not have a reaction.
2425,"""Joint pain after Covid booster?: After getting my Covid and flu shots, I've been noticing increased joint pain in areas where I've had previous injuries. Is this a common side effect of the vaccine, or should I be concerned about something more serious?"""
2427,Shingles on my face and scalp: Hello I Am on day 7 seven on a facial outbreak you are in the right place this sub is amazing. Since its on your face be on the lookout for any tingling near or around your ear. I have it on my forehead eyelid  and scalp a tingle started a few days ago and I woke up with facial paralysis and dxed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Justin Bieber recently had it as well with Ramsay Hunt. If you get a tingle or a bump near your mouth go to an ER and insist on oral steroids to avoid this if you can.hope you heal up soon Good luck
2429,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I think I had the vaccine I know I had chicken pox I vaguely remember it and I have 2 scars. I do not remember how old I was but it was before kindergarten. I had shingles last summer at 31. It was HORRIBLE. I did not have flulike symptoms thank God pain was horrible and damn near unbearable at times.
2430,I am hoping someone in this community might have some insight into the symptoms my mother is experiencing. Thus far no one has been able to figure out the because. I am a nurse but my expertise is in Cardiology so I can summarize recent events well but am at a loss on how to proceed from here and am not having much success with her PCP. PMH 68 year old with hypertension hyperlipidemia migraines anxiety depression left hip replacement in 62024 April 2024 developed L foot drop which she attributed to hip severe osteoarthritis planned hip replacement in June May 2024 developed intermittent lisp which has very slowly worsened and now progressed to profound dysarthria June 2024 underwent planned L hip replacement July 2024 had post op ortho appointment L foot drop had not improved or resolved so a lumbar MRI and EMG were ordered. At this point she was able to use a cane inside her home no longer required the walker Early August 2024 admitted for severe nausea hyponatremia and hypokalemia later attributed to HCTZ electrolytes replaced nausea resolved once normalized discharged home but just these two days were a significant setback from a strength perspective. From this point forward she required a walker a cane is not enough. August 12 saw new PCP for the first time who was concerned about speech and symptoms ordered stat head MRI which was done the following day. It showed old strokes which were news to us Mild chronic microvascular ischemic change and sequela of remote infarcts nothing acute but admission was recommended on the 14thbecause my mom thought her weakness was worse and her PCP thought her speech was worse over the phone thought it best to expedite neuro workup. Up until this point she was able to climb stairs slowly and carefully her house is 2 stories and could shower in her bathroom which has a shower stall and grab bars. I Am not sure exactly when but around this time she began to report hand weakness described as inability to open a chapstick and swallowing changes which she described as discomfort on the R side of her throat. Her midAugust admission notes state intermittent numbness and tinglingweakness in bilateral hands which she reported had developed since earlier August admission. Mid August 2024 admission with Neuro workup copy and pasting pieces of neuro consult below Patient was seen by neurology who noted upper and lower motor neuron findings suspicious for a motor neuronopathy. Neurology performed extensive workup including brain MRI which was negative for acute stroke though did show prior remote infarcts. Subsequent contrast enhanced brain MRI showed no evidence of intracranial metastasis. CT angiogram head and neck were negative. Cervical spine MRI showed degenerative changes in cervical spine with osteophyte complexes at C56 and C67 which resulted in mild central stenosis and moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing but cervical cord was of normal caliber and signal. Neurology did not feel that this would explain the patient's symptoms. The patient did have recent outpatient EMG due to left foot drop. Neurology advised repeat EMG to address patient's current areas of complaints. Lots of labs sent out phosphorus RF lyme titer B12 within normal fyou acetylcholine receptor binding Ab send out to test for myasthenia gravis fyou MUSK Ab send out fyou Lambert Eaton Ab panel send out fyou paraneoplastic Ab panel send out fyou spep upep send out fyou ANA send out Only abnormal results ANA Screen IFA Positive ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Mitotic spindle fibers ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Cytoplasmic fine speckled Ultimately thought to be motor neuronopathy My mom is a terrible historian and easily hysterical and dramatic at baseline so its difficult for me to sort out reality from drama with her. Its hard to say if her symptoms change from one day to the next and how quickly they are progressing because she cannot really give a straight answer. I will say that since her last admission and rehab stay she can no longer manage stairs of any kind and is living on one floor of her home. She cannot stand long enough to shower. Vaccines most recently in the fall 2023 covid flu shingles spaced out per pharmacist Including this because she is questioning vaccine injury but her symptoms did not seem to start until six months later She lives alone since my dad passed away in 2020 and is not doing well keeping up with maintaining her house which I did not truly appreciate until the last few months. Just last weekend I noticed significant mold in her basement but I do not know when it appeared. It was light gray not black from what I could see. I have not seen mold in the rest of the house but that does not mean its not there. She lives in an area with high iron content in water has a full house filtration system. She does not drink or cook with that water but has bathed in it and done laundry in it since 2000. I do not think it has been tested for any abnormalities. I Am wondering if she has an autoimmune disorder causing neurological symptoms if this is strictly neurological or something else I Am not aware of. I Am happy to provide any other info I can get my hands on if there is something I should have included. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
2431,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: I had chickenpox at age 21, and it was horrible. I want no part of shingles. Dose No. 1 of the vaccine in early January collided with an oncoming cold and made me miserable. Dose No. 2 is scheduled for early March. Fingers crossed."
2432,Was this really a thing?: My younger brother and I are both millenials I am at the very older edge but he is right in the middle. Both of us were just a bit before the vaccine was available. He caught Chicken Pox first. This would have been when he was 4 and I was 9. I remember my parents shrugging and laughing you will get it next I was kept in school until literally I saw the rash on myself in class. I remember this moment. Still did not get sent home until the end of the normal school day. I do remember the illness. I had like 12 days of feeling feverish and ill then about 2 weeks of itchy blisters. I still have a couple scars one in the center of my forehead from these blisters. Was not the worst but I understand it can be a lot more serious in some cases. And I am dreading shingles if it ever happens. Hope they make the shingles vaccine more available before I get much older
2434,Shingles vaccine: youSheToldMe the says Shingrix In 8 clinical trials of more than 10000 participants  Grade 3 reactions vaccinationrelated reactions severe enough to prevent normal activities were common 17 after patients received Shingrix.  About 1 out of 10 adults who received Shingrix reported grade 3 injectionsite symptoms such as pain redness and swelling.  About 1 out of 10 reported grade 3 systemic reactions such as myalgia muscle pain fatigue feeling tired headache shivering fever and gastrointestinal illness.  Most people 78 who got Shingrix reported at least some pain at the injection site. Lots of people myself included suggest rescheduling it to this Friday.
2437,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: Just did both at 37 weeks the doctor was concerned for the next few years with a rise of people not vaccine their kids. My son did not miss a step after getting them the pain of the needle was the worst part
2438,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had 103 fever day one, 102, next, and then tired but ok by third. Worst immunization I have had. I haven't had chicken pox in thirty years though so it makes sense my body didn't have many antibodies."
2446,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: My spouse had both shots and still got shingles about 67 times per year. Finally got put on daily val t rex for recurring shingles. But the shin gri x vaccine seems to have done absolutely nothing to prevent shingles for my spouse. As for me I got both shin gri x shots too and 7 months after the last shot got shingles. It was not a bad case but I got on val t rex on day one of the rash. It is not as effective as they advertise in my opinion.
2447,"I have gophers to kill.: I'd like some buying advice. I've got a bunch of gophers eating my veggies and I'd like to get rid of them. I'm not the bloodthirsty type but damnit I've had it with them. Anyway I was going to get a pellet gun but realized it was loud enough where they'd probably be able to react in time to dodge effectively. I think a bow will be quieter but I could be wrong. I'm thinking of getting a recurve with dull tips since I will mainly be shooting dirt. Also I'll be shooting from my roof so some kind of shingle camouflage might be helpful too. So what should I get? Are some setups quieter than others? Some of you may suggest using traps, that could work but there are like 3 thousand holes around so picking an active hole might be a pain."
2450,Shingles vaccine ahead of starting Simponi: I was very happy to have the shingles vaccine. I had shingles ten years ago. I got such a terrible line of blisters across my back that the only clothes I could wear for three weeks was my mum's old nightie that was three sizes too big for me. The pain of anything touching the shingles blisters was excruciating.
2453,Shingles vaccine: Got the first dose a month ago. My arm was a little sore for a couple of days. That Is it. Two people I work with for the shot and they were down HARD for three days. Like every side effect on the list they had. YMMV but getting hit hard with side effects for the weekend is infinitely preferable to actually getting Shingles.
2454,I was diagnosed HPV 16 positive back in mid 2023 and since then had two Pap2 and a full cycle HPV vaccine done. My latest Pap less than two months ago came out as Pap3 upon which my doctor did a biopsy and determined CIN3. Obviously my doctor recommended surgery however I have been considering getting pregnant first and getting surgery later. My husband and I have been dreaming of starting a family for quite a while and if it were not for the doctors recommendation for me to get the full HPV vaccine then we would have started trying for children last year. I know this may go against what most doctors say but obviously most doctors have to recommend surgery if you are not pregnant for liability reasons I suppose? After all they cannot say do not worry about the CIN3 and then risk you getting cancer later. I would love to hear from you whether getting pregnant first and having surgery done after is an option? Statistically how high are the risks of this getting out of hand and one needing a hysterectomy instead? I have read of conflicting experiences of women who were fine having a healthy baby with CIN 3 and surgery later and others where the disease ended up spreading swiftly. Thank you so much
2455,Everyone in like to the hold the baby: I wonder if they got the RSV vaccine for the baby. my daughter just got it yesterday at 5 weeks old and I Am so happy.
2457,Recent Shingles Diagnosis My story so far...: I have just got shingles too. Noticed on Sunday under my arm to mid back and part of a pec. Got meds on Monday. Valacyclovir. 42 to take in 7 days. it is my first time having it and my mind is blown. it is like having a branding iron attached to the side of me. Now today Wednesday I feel a lot better but I am also taking a 400 Advil with every 1st and 3rd dose. I am also taking a mens multivitamin with an extra 400iu vitamin D and I have applied vitaminE oil to the rash. It seems to be working good for me. What a nasty thing to have. Guess I will be hiding from the girls for a bit. Yikes. Good luck to you maybe my experience can help with yours.
2460,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My older brother got shingles in his facial nerve. It took months for it to go away. Half of the roof of his mouth was numb as was his cheek.
2462,Shingles vaccine: Shingles is WAY worse. Shingles after the shot is better. Have had shingles before the shots had the shots then still had shingles. Do the shots.
2469,This is my 1st post. I have been on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg for 4 years along with Lexapro and Remeron. Never had any symptoms after the initial 150 mg. In November 2023 I began the process of tapering off the Remeron and Lexapro. As of mid January 2024 I was only taking the Wellbutrin XL 300mg and feeling good. The tapers were hard with withdrawal symptoms but those went away. Then I got Shingles I am only 35 and that kicked my butt. Since getting the Shingles in January I have been dealing with horrible all day long nausea. Its now March and the nausea has improved but I am still having bouts twice a day. I am having to take Dramamine every day to help. The past 2 weeks I have also noticed I wake up with pretty bad anxiety. Its uncomfortable and makes me feel jittery. I have also been more irritated and crabby than I normally am. Also I am having the most bizarre and horrible dreams. So I do not know if these symptoms especially the nausea are just residual from the Shingles its been 8 weeks since diagnosis or if they are actually from the Wellbutrin its been 9 weeks since its been the only drug I am on. Could I be getting symptoms now since Wellbutrin is the only drug I am taking? Has anyone experienced symptoms all of the sudden after being on it for 4 years without a dose increase?
2470,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: My sister had them when she was pregnant with her second kid. She was in her mid 30s at the time. I had them a few months after my 50th birthday. On my face and in my left eye. Caused minor sight problems for a few months after. I have not yet got the Shingrix vaccine because I need to schedule them around a time when I can take time off work and stay in bed all day if I end up having an adverse reaction to one or both shots. My immune system always goes haywire when I get a vaccine. I still get them but I have to plan to be off work.
2471,RSV vaccine for a 6 month old: Exactly. I kept thinking that i could not forgive myself if he got sick so I just did it and he was fine
2473,I would love to tell you the 2nd dose is better but it is not. If anything a bit worse. Clear your schedule for it. But again shingles is worse. Far worse.
2477,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I had very mild dysautonomia before Covid but after its been severe. Covid kicked all my conditions into high gear unfortunately.
2487,Shingles vaccine?: I got the original live vaccine before my diagnosis and paid for it myself. My husband got shingles in his ears permanent damage. There was no way I was going through it I have since gotten the newer two part vaccine with little side effects. I Am glad I did because even since this happens I have had shingles twice but minor cases. The first was during my first case of covid the second was this year right after I had post surgical infections. If at all possible get the vaccine.
2488,I first got shingles when I was in the 1st grade at the age of 7. Since then I have had it 23 times per year at least I have honestly lost count. My first time was bad. No one had any idea what it was so I ended up with no treatment until it was bad enough to leave me with a scar I still have. Since then I have gotten better at noticing when it pops up even when it still looks like strange pimples. For context I always get it on my face. The last time I had them they were close to my eye and I went to an emergency eye doctor after noticing cloudy vision. It had spread into my eye. This time I noticed nothing until this morning when I recognized the red bumps. I had noticed my eye felt strange even yesterday but assumed I had dry eyes and was distracted with a headache anyway. All day today my eye has felt weird so I finally decided to look in the mirror and after lifting up my top eyelid and flipping it inside out which is very difficult and not recommended I noticed I had shingles inside of my eye and for God knows how long. I am a bit scared for my vision but I already had an appointment with the eye doctor tomorrow to update my prescription so I know I can address it promptly. The biggest thing is that after so long I am just tired. It is so stressful and there is so much pain. I will not be eligible for the vaccine for over 30 more years. I am so tired.
2491,Shingles vaccine experience: I got my shingles shot after seeing some work colleagues and my sister suffer with it. My second shot I was sick one day it sucked but not as bad as shingles would have been I Am 100 sure. Maybe we have to be louder and more obnoxious than the vaccine I think for the most part people who value vaccines just mind their own business and ignore the crazy vaccine maybe we need to get just as loud or louder about needing vaccines. I cannot believe they are trying to unapprove tetanus vaccines. I Am 50 and have had so many. I can never remember when my last one was so I know I Have had extra every time I Have had stitches or switch drs they ask me i do not know so I get one. I know I do not want Tetanus or polio. My daughter is engaged and talking about having kids I Am terrified.
2493,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Old way. 1st or 2nd grade. 89 Went to bed with oven mitts on and still have a pox mark in the middle of my forehead. The ones in between the butt cheeks were the absolute worse. Then in my early 20s I got shingles. I Am so glad my children are vaccinated.
2498,Newbie here: From what I've read on this sub and internet in general is prescribed antivirals work best if you take within the first 3 days of outbreak. Probably won't hurt to take after day 8. If you think they are helping they probably will.
2499,Shingles vaccine experience: I had the pox as a kid and got the vaccine Some flu like symptoms but was not that bad. Way better than getting shingles
2502,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My daughter is 7 born 25 and 5 they did not have the vaccine when she was in the nicu. Within a week of being discharged she was back in the hospital with severe RSV. My son born 26 and 3 did get the vaccine he did not have a reactionside effects he also never caught RSV.
2505,Shingles vaccine experience: Decided not to return for the 2nd dose.
2506,Covid flu and shingles at the same time. Is this how you get the autistic superpowers?: This is the most realistic response so far. if you consider virus poison My stamina is way down today.
2508,Shingles and other Vaccines: I did got a rare form of Shingles years ago at 33 years old. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is no joke that is pretty scary to experience. Justin Bieber got it and shared his experience on social media. Long story short half my face was paralyzed completely for months. It did takes 3 months to recover partially and an other 6 months for the rest to go away. I needed to sleep with my eyelid taped to keep it closed so my eye does not dry out. I could not eat properly and my hearing was damaged but recovered after a while. I was terrified to get stuck like that. Because it is possible to keep aftermath. I Am lucky to have 95 recovered only me can see it now. Recently I Have got vaccinated for it shingles vaccine. So I encourage anyone to get vaccinated
2512,There Is a lot to this. My 30f fiances30m sister33f is pregnant. She has a very specific birth plan their mother will be in the OR but once her cesarean is done mom leaves. No visiting in the hospital no visiting at home. My fianc is going to drive their mother there but his sister said he is not coming into the hospital or seeing the baby. She is not letting anyone see her baby for the first 2 months then until the baby is a year old anyone who goes near the baby MUST be fully up on ALL vaccines. This is all perfectly reasonable and understandable. Their mother is getting every vaccineflu RSV etc. And she is demanding that my fianc also get vaccinated he keeps up on them but needed RSV and flu. Again reasonable. But she originally asked him to tell me Id need to get vaccinated too. She lives in another state and I will not be going with I also do not live with my fianc yet. I have a medical condition that is specifically listed by the CDC as essentially blacklisted from getting certain vaccines because of the relatively high risk of death or at least life long complications. I am up on most of my vaccines. But the 3 I cannot get are RSV flu and Covid. I Have been told this by multiple doctors one of which specializes in my medical condition. I offered the alternative of distancing from him and his mother. He explained the risk those vaccines pose to someone with my medical condition and that Id be distancing instead. His sister was originally fine with this. Yesterday hes on the phone with her because she is venting about her boyfriend. I was unaware of this and sent him a text my dog died. He told her this and hung up to call me to make sure I was okay. She then proceeded to send him the CDC recommended schedule for vaccines in adults and said since she thinks she cannot get vaccinated He reminded her that I legitimately cannot get the 3 vaccines because of the risks and what my doctors have said about it. Essentially that I have a fairly high chance of bleeding out internally She said she did not care that even if I was distancing I needed to regardless of the risk. That not getting them was me being abusive to him. And that me being willing to distance from him was abusive. She told him to tell me all of this. He sends me screenshots but tells me to look at them when I feel up to it. I hate drama but it was a distraction. It was all absolutely infuriating. She said she fully understands the risks the vaccines pose to people with my condition and that she would not care if it was 100 guaranteed to kill me I needed to get vaccinated or else I was abusing him. He defended me in all of it. Telling her that I Have never been even remotely abusive that I Am being extremely respectful of everything all that. But there were things mentioned that I needed clarification on and he did just that. Apparently she would planned her accidental pregnancy. Her and her boyfriend were fighting very close to breaking up so she went off of birth control without telling him with the specific intent to get pregnant. She also intended for the baby to push him to finally get engaged and married neither has happened. Hes essentially checked out but is tolerating the relationship to try to not have a kid in a broken home Lying about birth control is legally rape. She knew this before doing it. Any bit of respect I had for her went right out the window with that even more so than everything else. Between all of that and still being feet away from my freshly dead dog medical alert service dog she died at home I was filled with a massive amount of anger Ill fully admit I tend to jump to the anger stage of grief but Id been on the phone with a dozen crematories vets and cemeteries that all told me I had to hold onto my dogs body until Tuesday. So that did not help. I knew that if she would messaged me the entirety of that anger would be directed at her. So I blocked her. She does not have my number she did not have me added she is taken no time to get to know me zero effort to even ask about me at any point in the past 3 years. I also blocked her boyfriend because my fianc has told me about how if she is trying to fight with someone and they do not respond to her she uses his Facebook or phone to do so. I did not say anything about it. About an hour later he asks me if I blocked her because she was going off about how she would clicked on my name in a post he would tagged me in and it said I did not exist. He relayed the message that Id blocked her at least temporarily to avoid the drama and unhealthy level of anger. She was demanding I unblock her immediately because she needed to get everything out. She got their mom involved because she has my number and ways to contact me. Their mom fully understands the risk the specific vaccines pose to people with my medical condition she appreciates that I respect her and her unborn grandchild enough to distance to reduce risk of spreading any illnesses. But she said I should just unblock her let her get it out. That its all just pregnancy hormones and I have to hear her out and then let it go. My fianc filled her in on what his sister left out and told her they both needed to respect my boundaries. His mom somewhat reluctantly agreed to drop it. His sister is still angry that I will not unblock her until things settle she is insisting that my fianc end our relationship because I Am being abusive and threatening to not let him meet his niece until he does. I Am still pretty damn angry but its all getting to the point where I Am considering unblocking her letting her start a fight and tearing into her to get some of the anger out because she added buckets of fuel to the fire. I know that is an asshole thing to do but the rest of it I do not know
2516,I am 35 weeks pregnant and went to get the RSV vaccine for pregnant women to protect myself and baby and I just received a call today from my doctor that the person who gave me the shot accidently gave me the AREXVY rather than the Abrysvo. I am sad angry and scared. From reading the label there have been no clinical trials on pregnant women but there are risks associated with premature birth and low birth weight. Granted I Am 35 weeks but I Am mostly worried about unknown potential side effects on my unborn daughter. I did read that there was a study on rabbits indicating worsening respiratoryRSV symptoms as a result of the shot on children younger than two does the count if she is in my womb? I have not yet found the original study to review. I feel sick over this and really hurt that this was made to be no big deal by the doctors office. I know because the vaccine is so new and there have been limited studies  people cannot really tell me much about potential adverse effects. I Am just worried about the potential impact it could have on my baby. I will be getting her the newborn RSV vaccine now. Anything else you know about this vaccine that should make me more or less concerned?
2520,Shingles vaccine experience: Thank you for sharing this OP  I had shingles on my 48th birthday about a year and a half ago and it was a nightmare. Lasted for weeks pain beyond anything I could imagine and I have had two natural childbirths so I have a high pain threshold. Seems like some people are making this about politicizing vaccines or berating people for not wanting to get a vaccine. But the reality is that most people want to get it will just put it off because as you shared you have to plan time off and prepare for a big reaction. I will echo your suggestion not to put it offfrom a shingles sufferer who still feels pain at the site nearly two years later  highly recommend everyone prioritizes getting the vaccine as soon as they turn 50.
2522,Born 61. Vaccinated as far as I know. By 6 or 7 I began to have shingles on the back of my neck. Usually a couple times a year. Always the same place. No real treatment. Pediatrician said Id grow out of it. I did not have chicken pox until I was 14. I continued to have shingles
2523,I saw my mother in severe pain. I was getting the vaccine but I got shingles a week after my 50th birthday. I still occasionally have flare ups of pain. They were on my scalp right side. The headache before the shingles appeared was horrendous. Get the shot.
2525,Shingles for the 2nd time forehead: I got shingles last year at 31 I had it on my forehead and it progressed through the trigeminal nerve and into my eye. Lost most of the vision in my right eye at the worst point. Had to take steroids and antivirals for quite a while but have made a mostlyfull recovery. Have some scarring on my forehead and neuralgia still. Partial numbness in my eyebrow and misplaced sensation. Lights are strange occasionally. I hope I never experience shingles zoster ever again I was told that since the virus was able to take hold in the nerve that if I ever develop symptoms again it would most likely be in the same nerve. I wish you the best and a quick recovery
2527,Dose two was worse for me. But OH had actual shingles and nothing is worse than that. And the pain still recurs 9 years later. Have the second dose
2529,So this is my first time of having a gout. Just a little background on me. I am fit I do powerliftingbodybuilding 29 yrs old. Gout runs in my family 5 out of 7 have gout. So my first flare up was 2 months ago I believe it was due to poor diet and dehydration then 2 weeks later had another flare up due to working out in the gym on a leg day specifically doing a leg press then the same thing happened again after 2 weeks. Basically I had 3 flare up in the last 2 months. Doctor just gave me colchicine prednisone and indomethacin. While I was on prednisone it developed my shingles to come out. So yeah 3 gout flare up and shingles for the last 2 months. Just want to know if somebody here experience about working out causes flare up?
2540,Have had Shingles pain for 2 12 months now torso. I was initially given gabapentin for my Shingles and PHN post heretic neuralgia. For the first 2 months I managed the pain with Tylenol Advil gabapentin. Not good but as it was very slowly getting better I assumed it would wrap up soon. Unfortunately the pain has plateaued and has been pretty steady for the last few weeks. 2 weeks ago I was given a prescription for Pregabalin aka Lyrica. And shazzam It was like a miracle I wish they had given it to me at the start So much suffering could have been saved. I feel like my old self again. Very little pain good energy to do things. I Am even exercising again which I could not have imagined 2 weeks ago Pain went from a scale of 78 to 23 HOWEVER The main side effect is the dizziness headinafishbowl feeling. Feel a little high. But I AM able to work my very challenging stressful job as an executive. Lots of computer work and Zoom meetings. And I have acclimated to the sensation a lot in 2 weeks. I feel it mostly when I Am sitting down. Staying a bit active helps distract me from the sensation. Also I requested a lower dose for days when I really need to be lazer sharp. 50mg vs the usual 100mg 3x a day I do not know how long I want to feel this way but its a mile ahead of where I was without it. I am grateful.
2542,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have high pain tolerance multiple root canals with no anesthetic and shingles was one of the most debilitatingly painful things I have ever experienced. I got in on the love handle and even a light breeze felt like a combination of being burned and being shocked by electricity. For weeks. The only pain I can compare it to was when I gave myself a papercut that sliced into the cornea of my eye.
2543,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I am 36 have dysautonomia and had shingles back in 2020 it reactivated in 2022 yes it can reactivate and i am about to have the vaccine in a couple of days since i was told to wait for a while. I have already been told i will experience discomfort and probably have neuropathy again in my scars but just for a couple of days. Honestly i prefer that to having to relive the pain of shingles get the vaccine.
2545,Second Shingles Shot: Ooh good to know. I suffered from the first and am dreading the second. Maybe it will be a big nothing burger.
2548,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: My second dose was barely a thing. Not sure why
2550,Shingles vaccine: I was fine after both shots.
2551,Vaccine reanalysis and excess deaths: sorry for your losses and what your going through. I did not take the jab but did lose my sister n law to a PE right after her first Moderna. 2 work colleagues are no longer here either. I hope you get back to the things you love to do
2555,My husband got the vaccine against my protests about 4 years ago. He had never had shingles. Now hes had them 4 times extremely painful longlasting cases. Its poison.
2560,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I was early 40's and I had a minor case. It was absolutely terrible. Get vaccinated if at all possible.
2563,"Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: ""That was the best punch biopsy I had"". Me after several samples drawn from 3 different spots. The doctor stared at me and the nurse burst out in laughter. In a room nearby a patient was crying no-nos all throughout my procedure and the doctor punched in a breast that was blue from a previous punch biopsy. For clarification, my first punch biopsy involved some blood, so I was happy that wasn't the case. Thank you for this somewhat disturbing, somewhat entertaining post, OP!"
2564,The Secret Menu of Pregnancy Symptoms: Acne Thought it was shingles at first Started on the left side of my neck got a brown rash from it went to my forehead now its on the right side of my neck and all over my chest It sucks Bloody noses too suck Plus severe constipation. I take three stool softeners a night plus milk of magnesia sometimes. Sucks Had to give myself an enema a few months ago. Was so flipping brutal Edit Also out of breath all the time I cannot even walk without huffing and puffing.
2565,Advancing: Yeah I usually get outbreaks when I take a warm/hot shower and go outside which sucks because now I have to take cold showers. I know everyone has different triggers that causes outbreaks. I get annoyed when I get an outbreak i just stay inside and don't go out. Hopefully they can find a cure
2567,My mom got the shingles. My stepdad and I sprinted out to get the vaccine Good gosh it looked awful and she was just nonstop squeaking about the itches and unpleasantness. Yes. Over 50. Do it. God bless you. I think it was almost 2 months before my mom stopped her squeakin
2572,Yep after that vaccine I am going to be so pissed if I get shingles.
2573,Hi all I got my 1st Shin gri x mid 92023 after my initial infection on my face in 22023. I have had a few flare ups prior to the Shin gri x and have been staying on prophylactic antivirals. I am trying to weigh when best to get the 2nd vaccine especially considering potential insurance issues. I have an a ppt mid 122023 for the 2nd Shin gri x 90 days out but if possible would it be better to wait if I can? Or would waiting longer not be much more benefit? My primary said 26 months out for the 2nd and I heard elsewhere that your immune system will greater benefit the longer you wait so like month 6. 6 months out would be March 2024. However my medical network may no longer accept my health insurance in 2024. Access to medical care in my area is scarce already but I luckily have an a ppt w a new primary who would be in network and I think would give me my 2nd Shin gri x worst case. Thoughts? Thank you so much
2575,Vaccine preps? USA specific: We have already gotten RSV and the latest Covid and flu. I got the pneumonia vaccine the other day but my husband had a migraine and canceled. Next up is TDAP a couple of years early. We had the original shingles shot and both got Shingrix 4 years ago my husband had his AFTER he had a mild case of shingles. We both had the measles when we were kids but that was over 60 years ago.
2576,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: Unfortunately based on my personal research there is no cure for PHN. I suffer from it too though I Have only had it for seven weeks. I recommend continuing with the treatment. When the nerve starts to wake up it causes more pain because shingles damage the nerve and as it slowly reawakens it causes pain. I Have found accelerated healing with light therapy specifically red light and infrared. If she tries this treatment ensure she stays extremely hydrated as it can because dehydration by forcing the cells to work in hyperdrive. Ultimately her body needs to heal itself but healing tends to slow with age. Shingles is supposed to be rare to get again once you have had it usually triggered by a stressful event. So if you feel stressed make sure to take some immune boosters to prevent the shingles virus from reactivating. Good luck.
2580,I had shingles too last Christmas. Also vaccine I suspect shedding.
2584,Rsv vaccine: My baby got it about 2 months ago has not been sick at all. But he does not go to daycare and is not around other kiddos.
2586,Shingles: Seeing your in pain I wanted to add a few things Shingles was so painful for me too It was on my ribs and boob fantastic . If you have a red light therapy device at home I have one for fertility proposes to help with DOR and my age 38 it can help speed shingles recovery by a ton I used it for about 15 minutes every day on the area on the 830850 wave length after finding studies that it helps. Other than that anti inflammatory diet helped too. I Am wishing you the fastest recovery possible and the best future Ivf results Sending hugs. This is not an easy time.
2588,I was a dental lab technician I made and repaired dentures. I am 48. I am unvaccinated. I have had shingles 4 times since the roll out of the vaccine. I also get heat rash like rashes if I am around vaccinated people. I ended up quitting my job and leaving the dental field.
2590,It is been 1.5 months since I had shingles on my face 4th time having shingles 1st time since getting Shringrix and approx. once a week for 23 days I will get a wave of postshingles neuropathy that presents as pain vertigo and brain fogconfusion. I have been describing the confusion like it is as if three people are always talking to me at once and I am just trying to make sense of things above the noise. This week I was really hoping would be milder since I started antihistamines and vitamins magnesium and lyseine to try and mitigate the symptoms even an antidepressant on my doctor's recommendation. It might be milder this time but it started much sooner than usual I usually get 5 days between the symptoms ending and starting again but this time I only had two days. I got really emotional about it yesterday but today's symptoms seem less instense so I am really hoping this keeps tapering off. I am extremely grateful it is not in my eye and the pain seems like it is less intense than people usually describe and I believe I have the Shringrix vaccine to thank for that. My previous infections were all on my back and much smaller and treated within one day so it was very mild. Has anyone got any suggestions for things I can do other than reducing stress I swear I do not do any chores at home right now and I am leaving work early every day I can. I am just reading and rewatching old shows and lounging in my friend's living rooms. I read that B12 might help? Any other suggestions? Anyone else with face neuropathy symptoms lasting longer than 1 month? Anyone else who had vertigo?
2591,Hi Just took my first dose. I was super scared at first because I thought it would be painful but I did not even notice the needle. Fingers crossed that I skip over any negative side effects. For those of you who did have side effects how long after your first dose did it hit? Height 59 SW 255 GW 185 Size 16
2592,LArginine and LCitrulline may trigger shingles in adults who have had chicken pox: It seems there has been increased cases of shingles since the COVID vaccine came out. I got shingles 45 weeks after getting my first COVID vaccine. But avoid arginine high foods when you have shingles. Also take lysine when you have shingles. It apparently helps. And we all know we would do anything to feel better with shingles.
2593,been there with the vaccine myself but Shingles sounds horrible.
2594,A friend took some for shingles recently and it cleared and scabbed in 5 days. Anyone with shingles would love a 5 remedy in 5 days instead of WEEKS My father took the shingles vaccine and got shingles 10 days later
2596,Do I have Histamine intolerance?: You might have had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. It happens sometimes. Take some antihistamines and get in to see the doctor. Symptoms of histamine intolerance usually get worse after eating certain foods and get better after not eating the foods taking DAO before meals or taking antihistamines. At least for me the symptoms from eating high histamine foods come on pretty quickly.. if I were to eat a can of smoked sardines some aged fermented olives and a glass of red wine I would go from feeling pretty ok to a horrible migraine with nausea and a few other symptoms that would put me out of commission after a couple of hours.
2598,Swelling after Varicella vaccine: 23 caucasian female. nkda. never had any reactions to vaccines. I got the varicella vaccine on thursday after having bloodwork done by the doctor and the results showed that I did not have the immunity to chicken pox so I needed to get the vaccine redone. I had the chicken pox previously when I was about a year old and then also had the vaccine done when I was younger. Yesterday i noticed a streak of swelling which has become larger and itchy today. Is this normal? <url> today is the white shirt and yesterday is the towel. edit: lump is also firm and warmer than the rest of my body
2599,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yes I did Especially after hearing from a friend about how awful shingles are. The shots hurt like hell and I did not feel great afterwards but no regrets
2600,Mpox vaccine induced shingles. Stay awake.
2603,41 and got Shingles: Same here had it twice in high school. Nothing since but the dormant virus caused permanent facial paralysis at age 37.
2609,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: Yes same my baby got hers at 2 weeks and was totally fine.
2610,In order to create the exact antibodies to neutralise the virus spikes it must be presented with an match 1st. How else can it hope to produce an effective AB. Mpox is body reexhbiting shingles which was dormant until the vaccine because it to become stronger
2611,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: i had a terrible headache the first 2 days and the standard arm pain. Now on day 4 everything seems normal again. The arm is also good slight pain when i touch it.
2613,41 and got Shingles: I did as well about your age. Was under crazy stress at work and doc told me that is what triggered. Very mild couple inch circle on my back only thankfully. Very burning and itchy feeling though. I did not take the anti viral just let it run Its course as was so mild. I was having other issues such as with breathing shortness of breath often could not take a breath that felt fullsatisfying kind of felt like suffocating all the time but no autoimmune issue or anything. I did not believe it could all be from stress but I decided to consider it might be an issue took a I will do my best and not give a shit about work anymore and all my issues went away. I could not believe it really I was so skeptical but appears it was all from stress.
2614,Shingles vaccine experience: Arm soreness is mostly torn muscles being relaxed means less of this as the liquid is injected and muscle fibers stretch rather than tear. Also gently rubbing the still relaxed arm after a shot also helps disperse it before using your arm.
2615,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chickenpox as a kid although it was not at a party. I remember being quarantined from my sister who was pregnant it the time. The age for shingles vaccine used to be 60 and I did not qualify. I think the age changed to 50 in 2018 but I was not aware and did not get vaccinated. I had shingles in August of 2021 and it was the worst thing I think I have ever experienced. Have you seen the commercials for the vaccine? They talk about being uncomfortable and getting a vaccine will avoid the risk of shingles. What they do not say in the PSA is that shingles is a herpes virus and if you have ever had a cold sore just imagine having hundreds of them break out starting from the center of your chest all the day around to the center of your back only one side or the other. Hundreds of those blisters popped up within a matter of 48 hours. It started on the center of my chest with what looked like acne bumps or something. Day 2 they had spread under my breast to my side. By nightfall they were all the way around to my back. By then the first ones where full blown cold sore blisters. I could not wear a normal bra for almost a year afterwards. If you are 50 or older and you have had chickenpox or herpes simplex 2 cold sores get vaccinated NOW. Your do NOT want to get shingles.
2616,"Has anyone here than has had shingles gotten the vaccine later, after being diagnosed? I hear that it may help: Yes, but different age group. 60 at time of initial outbreak. Had a one time mild reoccurrence a couple of months after. Focused on Covid vaccines for a bit after that, then finally got Shingrex vaccines. Side effects were tough, but now I no longer worry every time I get a small sore or bite."
2617,I Am experiencing what I guess is a flare brought on by weather change and over the past few days my upper back and neck have become painful. These areas of pain are new for me but I Have had nausea more or less perpetually for years. The difference now is in the severity. I felt similar overall unwellness and GI upset while traveling in the tropics and now that its suddenly quite cold here in VA that might be causing a flare too. My hips and lowermiddle thoracic spine are usually painful and there been markedly worse in the past few weeks. My uveitis and urethritis has flared back up in the same time period after being relatively quiet. Again the upper spinal involvement is unusual for me. Confounding things is the fact that I Am two months into a new pain med 5325 lortab at the end of a simponi dose and my wife just got over a case of shingles. A few seasonal bugs are circulating in our area. I recognized that these could be potential cofactors too. Has anyone else had these symptoms cooccur out of the blue?
2620,I got shingles on my mons pubisI guess its rare?: Its definitely not dryits a burning sensation constantly now. Does Not itch at all.
2621,I had shingles. Trust me get the vaccine
2622,I messed up and got the shingles Free to us older folks thanks Biden and the flu shot at the same time . Hit by a truck is right .
2623,Shingles vaccine: Shingles is far worse than the shot reaction I had it and would not wish it on anyone painful and difficult.
2624,"Thought it was heat rash lol: I unfortunately get nerve pain with shingles, my doctor put me on antivirals almost 2 weeks after my initial rash showed up. My nerve pain disappeared a couple days after starting the antivirals. Might be a coincidence but they seemed to help even though I didn't start them within the 3 days."
2628,Are soil warming pads good for outdoor potted plants?: Absolutely ETA I just got a shingles vaccine when I was already sick and I am wicked stupid right now but yeah I have a banana plant in my basement. It looks like shit but it will live through the winter looking shittier and shittier until that poor baby looks at the sun in the spring and goes and I ask myself how did I get here?
2630,"Chickenpox exposure, 16 weeks pregnant, vaccinated as a child - Looking for experiences!: Just to preface, I've already reached out to my OBGYN. I am a nurse, 16 weeks pregnant, exposed to disseminated herpes zoster for around 4 hours. Was wearing a gown and surgical mask, but not an N95, which is what I would've needed to wear. Patient was not on isolation yet as lots of labs and tests were pending, I thought I was being extra safe by wearing an isolation gown and mask ""just in case."" Found out today that I was exposed two days ago. I received two vaccines as a child, one at 12 months old and one at 12 years old. I am now 27 years old. Has anyone had a patient get varicella vaccine titers drawn, did it show immunity or no immunity? Just looking for experience! Any information or knowledge is welcome!

Now I Am shinglesshot age. Have confirmed with my doctor and my pharmacist that I am not a candidate for the shingles shot. I cannot find any definitive information about this online though. Not sure when the chickenpox shot came out but I know my step kid 30 had it. You Would think the answer to do I get a shingles shot if I Have never had the chicken pox and had the vaccine? would be easier to find online. If anyone has a source Id appreciate a link. Thanks
2661,Shingles vaccine?: I cannot stress it enough to get it. I have had shingles 4 times. I am now 31. The first time I got it literally felt like my head was on fire. I had NO CLUE what was happening so I went to the ER. Honestly up there in pain with labor. I wish I was able to have gotten one.
2663,"Super sensitive to noises now, 5 weeks recovery from Shingles: I have ear/face shingles, too and I have this. I also sometimes have this very loud whooshing sound in that ear and it's terrible when I have it. I went to ENT and actually have hearing loss but things feel too loud in that side."

2676,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: Yeah my father got it across his chest and back he was 78 then and was hospitalized at the VA for 4 days when I took him there. I felt bad only visiting once wbooties masks gown etc. but I could not take the chance of my mom getting it. That convinced me that I m doing it at 50 but I had never known that the side effects were any different than pneumococcal or flu until I saw various posts over last few weeks. I ll do it anyway but I was just curious as to others experiences. Thanks.
2677,That shingles vaccine is a rough one but after seeing what it put my Dad through I toughed it out with both doses.
2679,Shingles vaccine experience: I Am currently between shingles shots the first primarily resulting in a sore arm that hung around for a few days. I Have known people who were hit with shingles and its not pretty. Severe pain at best debilitating permanent nerve damagepossible blindness at worst.
2683,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I 36f had a severely itchy painful rash a few years ago that stretched across my entire chest and down onto my stomach. I went to an urgent care for it because nothing was helping and the doc had no idea what it was. He gave me some steroid cream which did heal it up but I am wondering now if it could have been shingles???
2685,Shingles vaccine: The newer vaccine does not have nearly the side effects of the original. I felt nothing not the least bit sore.
2687,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Boo fucking hoo for Trish. Shingles is extremely painful. I hope Trishs pain with shingles is excruciating and lasts for months and months and months. Mine did so I know of what I speak. I hope OP finds a good divorce lawyer.
2688,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: I take a low dose of amytriptaline, 25mg, and it took about 6 weeks. The first week it triggered a migraine and if I forget more than 1 dose I get a migraine. It hasn't prevented them as much as I'd like, but I don't know if I just need a higher dose. Originally it was prescribed for nerve pain associated with Crohn's then I learned after not getting migraines as often that it was also used for them."
2689,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Last spring at a pool in Vegas I started a random conversation with a guy from New Jersey. He showed me his shingles pictures and offered to buy a round if I promised to get my shots. We got a nice big drink and I got both of my shots. Second one wasn't any worse than my covid boosters."
2690,Should I get HPV Vaccine? Questions concerns and paranoia: The hpv vaccines are not mrna vaccines like the covid vaccine. I think it is fully worth the risk. Even though I was vaccinated for hpv I still have to get surgery to remove cervical precancer. I imagine it would have been much worse if I had caught other worse strains of hpv that the vaccine protects against. If you get married in the future it could save you a lot of trouble. These surgeries make sex and family planning more complicated.
2691,A week ago I was supposed to get my hair cut. I had enough energy to leave the house and drive 45 minutes. I got to the parking lot exhausted and suddenly felt an unrelenting itch all over the left side of my body. Like everywhere but mostly my neck and back. I cancelled the appointment and sat in the car for another 1 12 hours trying to gather the energy and will to make it back home while dealing with the constant skin crawl. Ironically I was offered a shingles vaccine at the last Dr appt 1 12 weeks ago but declined because I want to stave them off until I can figure out what is up with my immune system by myself it seems. I Have got rashes of excema on my left side from my arm to my back as well as smaller hive like bumps. I thought it was the detergent so I washed all my clothes. I had shingles once about 15 years ago and it sucked. I do not think this is what it is but it has some similarities. Ugh. It feels like a nightmare inside a bad dream.
2692,Shingles Sucks: It is because I have an auto immune disease. I have heard that you only get shingles once you know for a regular person. My bad breakout was all over my body. I thought people only got shingles on one side of their body? It sucks.
2696,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Suck it up. It is worth it. After suffering from a fullblown case of shingles then getting the twoshot series so it would never flare up again I am here to tell you that the shots' side effects are nowhere near as bad as a case of shingles. Even without any complications of having it threaten one of your eyeballs.
2700,Shingles vaccine?: I Have had two shingles shots and did fine. Just a sore arm. It was recommended for me by my Rheumatologist as well.
2702,38F Caucasian average heightweight no significant history only med was Flonase spray Hi I just broke out with my first case of shingles. It started with phantom itching on my right rib then progressed to deep intense muscle pain under that rib that spread around all the way to my spine on the right side. I broke out in blisters 3 or 4 days later and started famcyclovir that afternoon. It is been about 48 hours since I started on the famcyclovir and I started noticing itching on my LEFT rib. Wrote it off as paranoia but now I am starting to get that unmistakable deep muscle pain on the right with twinges on my right side back. I am like 90 certain I am getting another shingles outbreak in the mirror image now on the left side 5 days behind the rightside outbreak and 2 days into antivirals. How weirduncommon is this and what should I do? Thanks Add I have been having new undiagnosed intense sinus congestion since April or May thought it was an allergy to my new cat but allergy testing came up negative. Had started taking flonase for maybe 710 days before this all happened but other than that no meds.
2705,41 and got Shingles: 36 I was in the middle of a job transition and super stressed. It came along my right shoulder and I wore suspenders which aggravated it even more. I was miserable until I saw my doctor. Sorry that it is happening to you it sucks and is painful.
2706,: I did not get the buster but I did get the first time round My children had all vaccines one has a swelling in his neck specialist says it looks very suspicious going in for further treatment so very worried
2707,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: I had suicidal thoughts 3 days into Gabapentin when I was 25 and no prior history of depression. I also got auditory hallucinations I heard people talking and yelling. Its on my no list. But I think these are rare side effects
2709,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I heard about these as a kid but I was born in 95 so I had the vaccine. Most kids I grew up with I think did as well as I never remembered hearing someone was home sick with it.
2711,It39s a COSTCO HAUL We are stocking up SHOP WITH US: I had no reaction to the shingles vaccine. I have had a few very mild cases of shingles but because of the vaccine I could handle it fine.
2713,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My sister got shingles from the chicken pox vaccine so you could lose either way. Still 100 support vaccines.
2714,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I was one of the unlucky ones who got it in my eye area worst pain I ever experienced its been more than a year and I Am still dealing with nerve pain from the damage. I Am the same age as you.
2715,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: I got shingles at 63 years old and it did because permanent eye damage. I did get the vaccine a year after the outbreak and had to pay out of pocket. I live in British Columbia.
2716,I have a friend who said God bless you for not taking the shot since he did and then got shingles.
2720,Be sure to get the shingles vaccine. I had shingles in my right ear that caused paralysis on the right side of my face. That caused facial nerve damage. Now I have an incurable taste disorder. Salty salty mouth. It is awful.
2723,Shingles vaccine: I got Covid booster and my first shingles shot at the same time. Do not recommend. The 2nd shingles shot was uneventful.
2726,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick with either one. I Have heard from a lot of people that they did not have any after effects from the first one but then felt lousy fluish for about 1224 hours after the 2nd one. Both my husband and I had no effects from either one. Wishing the same for you
2727,I have had every side affects from Covid vaccines I had the shot one booster because they told me my mother had to have them for her to attend the dementia day care center. I have now stopped taking all vaccines. The only one I took was the new shingles vaccine. I
2730,Last Covid 2022 4th shot Got RSV Flu Pneumonia Shingles last 92023. No Covid. Getting no vaccines this year. Our kids are getting more sick not more well.
2735,I got the shingles vaccine and warning the side effects are severe.: Ya my whole body just felt like I had been run over.
2738,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: My teenager got the first injection and refused to go back for asecond saying it was too painful
2739,I got my shingles vaccine last year. Its two shots spaced out. Made my arm sore but did not give me any other side effects. I know people who got shingles and I do not want it.
2741,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Okay. This is ridiculous. Chickenpox is not just some benign disease. It can have severe consequences and long lasting complications. 30 children die per year in the US from chickenpox. That Is way down from numbers before the vaccine but that does not matter to those parents who lost a child. The scarring can be devastating. Yes its just appearance but other kids and adults can be total assholes about that. My cousin got one on her EYE It froze her pupil open. That has affected her for her whole life. THAT was the reason when my oldest was old enough she got the vaccine as soon as it was available. This was when it first came out. Our insurance would not even cover it because it was so new. We were very young and did not have a lot of money but I paid out of pocket for it due to how important it was to me for my daughter to be protected. This lady decided on her own to expose her own grandbaby to this illness. Who does that? Her little boy played it off like it was nothing for his daughter to suffer for absolutely no reason. Locking a sick one year old in a car? To manipulate his wife into apologizing to his mom for being upset that this insane woman exposed their INFANT to chickenpox on purpose? HEALTHY children should not be left in a car This man has shown who he is to OOP. She should believe him. He will never change. He stayed to take care of his MOMMY who ironically got shingles instead of returning home to be with his sick baby A baby that was sick expressly due to his mommy Shingles hurt badly. I would not normally say this but I hope she was suffering greatly. I hope she hurt like hell. I hope it was somewhere VISIBLE as that shit leaves bad scars. We had a friend come down with shingles in his early 30s on his forehead at his hairline. Left a gnarly scar. At least she was an ADULT and could communicate with others about how she felt how much pain she was in and can restrain herself from scratching. Things a baby cannot do. She should tell him not to come home because it is not HIS home anymore. He destroyed his marriage did not get upset with his mother for injuring his child and then did not come home to be with said sick child. He is garbage. He will never change. Mommy will always be more important than the family he and is SO created and that is messed up. Makes one wonder if charges can be pressed against the grandmother. Child endangerment child neglect child abuse? I would definitely consult with CPS or the police to find out. Lord knows she deserves it. Aaarrrrrgh I Am so angry for this woman and her child.
2742,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Was vaccinated when I was 2 so did not need this. Only knew it was a thing from South Park.
2743,I Am miserable its on my face: This is terrifying. I hope you are OK and things improve. Mine has been on my scalp neck and ear. The rash has stopped spreading thankfully day 3 of antiviral meds but I am getting some nerve pain still around my ear area. Do you have any advice?
2749,Did your parents make you go play with the kid who had chicken pox?: Oh man that shingles shot is the worst. I had to clear 2 days of my calendar for the second shot.
2752,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: 2 weeks is about as long as I can push it. So let us hope you are right. And the pain is surmountable. Like I can likely grit my teeth through that I think. It is the fatigue that it getting me down. Or maybe it is lack of sleep because the pain makes it hard to lay on my side? I do not know...Just make it stop I have been training for Javelina for too long to let it go
2753,I am sorry I just need to moan.: There are a lot of good suggestions here. I take a glucosamineMSMHyaluronic AcidTumeric combo supplement. It helped a lot with random kneetoehip creaky pain. I also take collagen. I agree on possibly needing a night guard. I got one after actually splitting my back molar in half from grinding. Some symptoms that you need one are sensitive teeth pain in the jawmouthface. Also gums receding. Stretching is great. Also make sure you exercise regularly. I do some joggingwalking and strength training. Its imperative to move as you age. Get a good pillow. Cannot emphasize this enough. I take mine when I travel. So sorry about the shingles my MIL had them and its just awful. On a side note I developed issues with statins as I aged that caused weird painjoint issues that made me feel super old. Not sure if you are on them.
2754,Shingles vaccine first dose side effects report: It can sometimes trigger a flare. But as someone who watched their father deal with shingles its a small price to pay. Shingles is awful.
2755,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I caught it the old fashioned way. My big sister caught it in first grade with her whole class and then she brought it home to infant me in 1985. I consider myself lucky that I was too young to remember it but I have always had scars on my face from picking the sores. The shingles vaccine says age 50 but I have multiple family members who have gotten shingles in their 30's. I have an antibody deficiency so vaccines and antibodies are already less durable in me. Shingles messed up my relatives it almost put my mom in the hospital. Another relative is blind in one eye from it. The antibodies from the vaccine have been proven to be more durable than the ones from natural infection.
2758,Shingles shot Ack: I plan to get this the moment I am eligible. I have had shingles twice now and the first time I was left with sciatica for 7 years afterwards. Hope you feel better soon. At least with the vaccine the immune side effects pass fairly quickly.
2761,Odd.. but.. decrease in shopping addiction? Hear me out.: Great Were on a similar timeline. I take my third shot this coming week. Have Not had any symptoms whatsoever including reduction of addiction urges. Ill wait and see.
2762,I got the whooping cough vaccine yesterday and OH MY GOD: Same here Just use it as a reason to rest properly although in my case harder this time with a toddler too I Am going to be interested if I react to the RSV one and I genuinely could not face the side effects of the covid vaccines again so have declined that this time because they have always been 34 days flat out with flu symptoms and fevers which is just impossible with a toddler
2766,ON Where in GTA can I get my infant vaccinated against RSV?: McMaster Childrens Hospital has a RSV clinic but they look to be appointment only Edit In case anyone else is looking your childs paediatrician may also be offering the RSV vaccine. My daughters offered it today alongside the flu vaccine.
2768,Get the bloody Shot I had Shingles in my eye and the pain was beyond belief
2772,A very interesting post anyone had shingles after having Covid vaccine ?
2776,Recent Shingles Diagnosis My story so far...: best of luck I have also be supplementing with LLysine. 3x 1000mg per day .Day 810 I finished the antivirals yesterday and I am feeling pretty decent. pain is subsiding. Rash is still there but never spread larger than 4 inch radius and starting to disappear. Was it the antivirals alone did taking the LLysine help? cannot be 100 sure but its a low cost over the counter supplement that will not harm you anyway. One I am through this shingles bout I plan to take LLysine 1000mg a day for the next month or so and then stop.
2781,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I have heard of these parties before. My cousin and I had them roughly at the same time not sure who was first. My sibling received the vaccine. I plan on getting my shingles vaccination as soon as they will let me but it may be too late.
2783,Shingles vaccine: Same i have not Had any side effects from vaccine
2792,I started the shots in March and have worked up to 1.5mg I took my second 1.5mg shot today. I Have been slowly increasing due to increased anxiety. I think I Am getting to the point where the anxiety is outweighing the benefits of the shot. Has anyone stopped cold turkey or should I ween off slowly? If you have quit after a higher dose and not tapered off were there adverse side effects?.
2793,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: Looks similar to shingles. My ex had shingles last year at 41 years old. There were 23 spots similar to this and the it broke out all over his left side from his thigh to his upper abdomen. When it spread they did not all look this way though. They seemed to open up and dryscab? pretty fast. We dealt with it for a few months. If that is what it is and you do not have the shingles vaccine get it. If you do not vaccine Separate. I thought I was fine and about 810 weeks after his seemed to be controlled I got it. However I did not initially have wounds.... I just had severe pain in spots and eventually redness... I was vaccinated previously for chicken pox... I never had them just the vaccine Apparently that happens though If you can avoid it do so. I hope he gets better
2794,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: May actually be related. My dad was part of a study to see the safety of getting the first Shingles shot and the flu shot at the same time. Obviously this is anecdotal but they observed that most people who did not have much reaction to the COVID shot not counting the sore arm did not have much reaction to either Shingles shot. A lot of comments on here are reinforcing this theory. Which means it will probably knock me on my ass but I will still be beating down the door for Shingrex right when I turn 50
2795,Some itchy spots started 56 days ago on my back and then more and more finally to the point that the pain kept me awake last night so I went to see the doctor and its shingles. What I do not understand is I never had chickenpox exposure and I have proof. I had an antibody test done in 2019 which showed I had no Varicella Zoster chickenpox antibodies and was told by my doctor to get the varicella vaccine and I immediately got the vaccine as told. 5 years later now I have shingles?? I decided to take the varicella vaccine 5 years ago precisely because its supposed to protect me from shingles. But I just checked the vaccine is live attenuated virus and that is the only plausible way how the virus got into my system. I Am confused and angry. Pain and suffering aside which has been bad but hopefully not for too long the blisters are going to leave permanent scars and increase my risk of Alzheimers? All because I Have been trying to protect myself and my family by taking the vaccine?? I Am not vaccine at all I just want to understand.
2801,Shingles second shot update.: You lucky SON. kicked me like a donkey. I was laid low.
2802,Shingles Is NO Joke: Had it in my late 20's and I am in my mid 30's now. It was on my left hip and that hip is now my bad hip. I have had doctors tell me I should not have continuing issues from it and they are full of shit. My RA is now the worst in that joint when I am flaring. When I have sciatica issues it is in that leg. I cannot cross that leg over the other without grabbing my foot. It is super frustrating.
2808,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: I have had shingles and trust me GET YOUR FUCKING SHOTS I kept putting it off and I paid the price. It is absolutely brutal. I got lesions that got infected that were all over my torso and wrapped around to my back. I was absolutely niserable for weeks. I have scars and still have some residual pain and itching a year later.
2814,I have just had my 10th bout of shingles each is worse than the last. This time I could not even lie on my back or side or bear anything near my back. This time covid vaccine Saturday late afternoon shingles by Monday morning.
2815,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I have permanent nerve damage on my face from shingles. It is painful. Get those shots.
2817,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles 2 years ago Worst pain I Have ever been in and I had 2 csections. I hope you feel better soon But to answer your question my mom did allow my little sister to be around me I was 7 my sis 5 so she could get it and heal around the same time.
2830,"How does my lack of immunity to varicella affect my chance/ability to shingles?: 23 y/o F Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, fibromyalgia, asthma, environmental allergies, food sensitivities. I posted recently about having chicken pox at age 23 despite having had it twice prior, as well as 2 vaccinations. I now have results from a titer confirming the varicella virus at the time I was experiencing symptoms. This has brought up the issue of whether or not my body has developed any immunity to the virus. I have an appointment with my GP next month and we're going to discuss it, but I am very curious about the implications of not developing any immunity. Particularly I'm curious what this means for shingles. I keep going back in forth in my head thinking, ""maybe this means I won't get shingles"" and ""I'm going to have the worst possible case of shingles!"" I've tried to do some research and have found a few research studies on breakthrough infections of varicella, but they seem to mainly have examples of much younger people, and extreme secondary issues that required hospitalization. I just had really bad chicken pox all over my body, and a low grade fever for maybe two days before it subsided. If anyone has any thoughts, knowledge, or ideas for what to search for, please let me know!"
2834,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am Gen X. We did not have Chicken pox parties before the vaccine. There were rumors of them in the 1960s or 70s but I do not know they actually ever happened However I had chicken pox when I was 16 months old. Therefore when the typical outbreak happened about 2nd grade 1986ish I got a raging case of shingles. So bad I still have nerve damage across the left side of my back where I have almost no feeling. Also I Am in the US. The shingles vaccine is available to everyone. Its RECOMMENDED for those over 50 or immunocompromised but anytime one is exposed to chickenpox after having had it there is a chance for shingles. And shingles are fucking horrible. Get the vaccine.
2835,PSA Shingrix: I m sorry to hear that. I had both dose of Shin gri x with no side effects.
2838,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got the shingles vac along with covid and flu. woof took a few days to recover from that. Do not forget to get the follow up or you will have to start over.
2840,RSV vaccine: I got the RSV vaccine a few weeks ago. I did not have any side effects from it not even a sore arm. Doc said that we can also have baby vaccinated at their first appointment after delivery. Well be doing that as well just to cover our bases 
2841,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got it around 9 am. It starting hitting at around 23. Was at my boyfriend s about 5. Had the cold shakes. He was throwing blankets on me. I am usually menopausal hot. Took two Advil went to bed. I was ok except sore arm in the morning.
2842,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I will get the shot as soon as I can. My mom recently came down with 12 a tingly scalp not her first outbreak and I embarrassingly had to out myself as someone with herpes as I forced a giant container of acyclovir at her. It would have taken her days to get an appointment and prescription and you have to get on that shit as soon as you feel the tingles trust me on this. Luckily it saved her having a massive outbreak and she got to go on her planned vacation a week later.
2845,41 and got Shingles: I got it last year after years of immune compromise. 9 weeks with it wrapped around my right side of chest front and back. Worse than multiple surgery recoveries.
2848,Is this my life now?: I Am so sorry to hear this Having shingles sucks and if you have never had them you have no idea what hell it is. I too have severe post herpetic neuralgia from getting shingles in March of 2023. I have been living with chronic pain ever since and am on heavy doses of narcotics just so I can get out of bed in the morning. I just had a Spinal Cord Stimulator put into my spine with a battery inserted in my lower back behind a muscle. So now I Am not only living with my shingles pain but now I have post surgical pain as well. Something that was supposed to make me feel better has now made me feel 10 times worse. I Am only telling you this because there are people out there that understand what kind of pain you are going through and though I do not sleep for 20 hours a day I sometimes wish I could. I Am just in too much pain for that. I will never be able to work again and I do not through a single day without pain. All of this is really affecting me. I definitely think you should find a new doctor. This one seems to be ignorant. I am grateful for the wonderful group of doctors I have. I am here if you ever want to talk.
2849,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Well the us version of the vaccine was released in 1995 for those a year and up. I got the vaccine but I still got the chicken pox. Wether or not I will have shingles is to be remained seen.because regardless if you had the vaccine you can still get shingles from the chicken pox if you had gotten the chicken pox. It just makes shingles more milder.
2851,Peds offices with the RSV vaccine?: Yep my son got the shot at his 2 week weight check appt at Genesee Transit pediatrics
2852,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got the two Shingrix shots earlier this year and it is my new least favorite vaccine supplanting the tetanus shot's long reign at 1. Still better than getting shingles from everything I have heard.
2854,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I had all my vaccines and I got shingles at 29. I also had chicken pox when I was younger. Doctor said it can happen with stress etc and I cannot get the shingles vaccine because I Am too young.
2858,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: 1st one sucked. Felt like I had the flu. 2nd one I had no reaction to."
2859,LArginine and LCitrulline may trigger shingles in adults who have had chicken pox: I got shingles earlier this year at 33 after starting collagen supplements and completely changing my diet. I was aiming for hormone balancing foods but they all happened to be high in LArginine. Shingles happened a few weeks after. I was not stressed about anything so I refuse to believe it was stress induced.
2861,Shingles vaccine: I am in AZ. Shortly after I got the first shot a few vaccine at work were making fun of me right after I got the second the ostracizing was worse I did not care I dealt with those aholes during covid too since we were considered essential workers. One of them came down with shingles and was off work for several months since it was on her face and one eye. A few of her cohort changed their tunes and got their jabs.
2864,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Do Not They both hurt like the dickens
2866,Shingles vaccine experience: I had the shingles once and never again. I got the shot and get the second in February. My cousin lost the use of his right arm because he ignored the symptoms of shingles and got a full blown case. Cannot play a musical instrument anymore and has limited use of that arm. Cannot rest it against his body without pain. And this happened fifteen years ago.
2875,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: That is good you did not get it. I got it for the first time 6 months ago. Was just like a bad cold.
2876,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I feel for ya. I had shingles on my face in September. It was fucking awful. I am still dealing with the after effects. For me it was more itchy than painful but like crazy itchy. You will get through this but it is going to suck.
2877,33f went to urgent care because of rash turns out its shingles: Something to mention is I used otc lidocaine and the brand I got was SO PAINFUL on initial contact because it had alcohol. If you can find a brand without because that will burnnnnnn
2878,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Got my first shingles shot on Thursday morning. Thursday I got the sore arm and still kinda have it. Thursday night I had the fever and had a terrible time sleeping. I was really tired on Friday/Friday night. Waking up now on Saturday morning I feel great. This is almost the same reaction I had to any of the COVID vaccines with an arm that is more sore. I also never had the Chicken Pox that I was aware of and had been vaccinated against it on two occasions.
2880,RSV shot during pregnancy or after?: Anecdotal experience here. I got the maternal shot at about 36 weeks pregnant AND my baby got Beyfortus at her 6 month appointment. We are both fine. She was born 9 lbs 4 oz. She had no I will effect for the Beyfortus.
2881,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had it in my 30 s. it is really important that as soon as you think you may have it get to your doctor There are anti viral s that mitigate the symptoms if you start them soon enough. I had small red bumps on one side of my body in a strip from my sternum around my side. A little itchy and woke up and they were draining a little bit of clear fluid. I started anti viral s that day and was cleared up within a week although 20 years later I still have an itch that pops up and I find myself scratching at the area every now and then. I got vaccinated as soon as I was eligible. Also an ER nurse and have seen what a nightmare it can be.
2883,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Maybe I am lucky because I did not have any side effects from either shingles shot. Hoping you are lucky too OP.
2884,Shingles vaccine experience: I was vaccinated and got shingles still but it was likely less severe than it would have been.
2885,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I went to a pox party and at the tender age of 21 I got shingles from immense stress. In my mid 30s now and just waiting for another bout.
2889,hi I am in my 30 s have an autoimmune disease and have had shingles mostly ramsay hunt three times since december of 2020. 90 sure I am at the beginning of the fourth right now. kind of at my wits end here checking to see if anyone has had a similar experience. first case in dec 2020 bad patch of blisters on my jaw by my ear. my doctor took it VERY seriously and immediately put me on meds and in touch with an ENT because she was worried i would go deaf. that case was not too bad in terms of pain or vertigo. second case aug 2022 opposite side of face but same der mato me. felt like trash exhaustion mild fever bad headache the day before and then one incredibly painful blister started on my chin. realized what i had immediately took va lacy clo vi r and a gaba pent in. called my doctor's office who told me to keep doing that. this was a friday by saturday i was in agony. by mon or tue s i had vertigo and hearing loss even though i was taking the val t rex 3 x a day. they prescribed me high dose steroids vertigo meds and oxycodone. took weeks to get right again. third case sept 2023 on my stomach went to the doc as soon as i knew what it was had already started the val t rex the night before and the urgent care doc scolded me for not letting it get bad enough for them to test it. kind of told me i was a hypochondriac while also agreeing it was shingles? no pain that time. he also goes go to CVS and demand they give you the vaccine but they probably will not because you are under 50 so good luck now half an hour ago i realized the inside of my right ear was numb and burning and the numbness crept to the area under my right eye. i have what i think is a blister forming on my jawbone in the same place as that first case i had. obviously I have had recurring pain on the left side a lot after my really serious case last year but never anything on this side so this feels like yet another new case of ramsay hunt. my problem is that my doctor who took it seriously has since left the practice my replacement GP is never available and other doctors seem to think I am either mistaken or being dramatic. anyone who has had this knows it is in fact not dramatic to know what shingles feels like to be scared of waiting too long to treat. I am half tempted to not take the meds and let a blister develop just so they cannot tell me I am work up over nothing but this also feels like a TERRIBLE case coming on and my ENT confirmed the last time i had ramsay hunt that i almost certainly would have had permanent hearing loss if i had waited until they called me back to start meds. i guess my question is. any advice? what the hell do i do if this gets worse and the blister is not in the stage where they can test it? most doctors I have seen seem to think that people especially in my age group cannot get this more than once let alone four times. I am worried I will need steroids again it will get much worse if they do not take me seriously. I am not even going to try for pain meds. t lr have had shingles 3 x 2 x ramsay hunt one of those very serious not being taken seriously by docs i have access to pretty sure i have another case of ramsay hunt starting right now and do not want to risk long term effects by waiting to for blisters to materialize before medicating. want docs to take me seriously have the test on file that proves i have it again but also do not want to have a paralyzed face or loss of hearing.
2890,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: Yes children get RSV many times during childhood most dangerous for children under 1 and those with preexisting conditions. But since it is a safe vaccine glad it is available. My 4 week son got and glad for the peace of mind.
2891,Shingles vaccine second dose: Wow you beat me. I got Covid booster flu and Shingles at the same time
2893,Put me out of my misery.: I just had my first shingles vaccine three days ago. I booked it on purpose during my week off work between Christmas and New Years because I had heard some people had a really rough reaction to the vaccine. Just to balance out all the bad reactions I had almost zero reaction. My arm felt sore but nothing else. My friend also had the vaccine and said she had no reaction. Its a crapshoot apparently. I Am hoping the second shot goes well for me too
2895,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I am a child of the late 70'searly 80's and we all got forced to attend these pox parties. Some kid in the neighborhood would come down with it and the parents would start hosting sleepovers at the request of all the other parents to try to get us all infected. As a kid you had no fucking idea what was going on and it was especially confusing as to why you are sleeping over at the house of a kid you barely know on a school night. They were not without their risks. Despite the prevailing medical opinion that the course of the virus is milder when you contract it in your youth you are still rolling the dice. My brother lost about 70 of his hearing and I got significant scarring. I also did not get the natural immunity that was assumed to follow childhood infection and I contracted the chickenpox again at age 25 and required hospitalization the symptoms resemble meningitis for a few days. This crunchy Anti vaccine shit pisses me off. Do not subject your child to needless suffering and questionable immunity from natural exposure. Get the damn varicella vaccine. You can bet your ass that I will be getting the shingles vaccine the day I turn 50.
2896,More bS. Vaccine induced shingles I reckon.
2898,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I got the original in high school on 2007 and then in 2020 when I was diagnosed with HPV I asked for an updated one. Had I been told between that time that there was an updated one when it came out I might have avoided having longterm HPV. I do know people who claim they have had bad side effects from the vaccine I think its likely more helpful than not for most people though.
2899,I got the shingles vaccine dose 1 and flu shot while on my period. I knew it would delay my ovulation. But then I got the C covid booster and that messed things up further and here I am on cycle day 42 waiting to ovulate usually ovulation is day 18 and my cycles are 32 days long. I was told when getting my shingles shot that if I get pregnant before my second dose I d have to wait until after childbirth to get it. Well now it s only two weeks away so it s looking like I will get the second shot and it will mess me up even more. Ugh Annoying.
2900,Monday 527 had weird skin pain my body around my stomach and right leg down felt painful to the touch. Rash started 528 and had confirmed with the dermatologist it was shingles that Thursday 530. Its been mild the pain to my skin has gone away. The rash is a little itchy still but I am on valtrex 3 times daily for 7 days. I could not imagine this all over I got very lucky.
2904,Shingles vaccine experience: Yeah 2nd one hurt worse than 1st but wtf were gen x we are used to bullshit pain. It goes away. Just throw some dirt on it and get back into the game kid.
2908,How are you feeling from your shingles shot?
2909,My mother just got the shingles vaccine and it was for nothing. She also got the hooping cough vaccine for nothing this has been the case for a long time might want to start talking about new polices.
2913,How to keep NICU baby safe from illnesses after discharge?: Sorry I should have specified that they still went by first season rule they just did not limit by 28 weeks or younger  it was this either Jan or Feb of this year he was able to get. I would like to know why it can only be the first season but I can only think that it is because the vaccine is relatively new? My son did get RSV and I believe the vaccine kept him from being admitted to the hospital. A mom friend of mine has a full term baby who was too low on the list to get a vaccine for the small number the office received and he did have a stay in the hospital to recover. It is so scary all around.
2916,Shingles shot Ack: Just a note that if you are a side sleeper for your own sanity do not get the shingles shot or a double covidflu on the arm you sleep on. That was a miserable two nights without decent sleep
2918,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Thanks for the response. At this point my only options are to wait until morning and call the Rheumatologist office or go to the ER. I Am not sure what they would do to help me at the ER. I Am not sure what the Rheumatologist would do at this point. I definitely will not be restarting Rinvoq until I feel better. What a nightmare. To top it off my spine and hips are in terrible pain as well.
2920,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I took G9 and still got HPV with LSIL on an abnormal pap 3 months after my 3rd dose. Would absolutely not do it again especially since I paid for it out of pocket. It gave me a false sense of security. I would rather just use condoms and take active precautions if I were to have the choice of taking it again.
2922,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my recent experience with a vaccine reaction that led to some unexpected complications. A couple of weeks ago, I received my flu and coronavirus vaccine booster shots. Shortly after, I started experiencing lightheadedness, chest tightness, and sharp pains in my left thigh. I initially brushed it off as post-vaccine symptoms, but things took a turn for the worse as the pain intensified and I developed a rash on my lower back. After a trip to the ER and a series of tests, I was diagnosed with shingles, which was incredibly painful and challenging to manage. I've been on a regimen of medications and treatments to help alleviate the symptoms, and I'm finally starting to see some improvement. It's been a rough journey, but I'm grateful for the support and care I've received along the way. Stay safe and take care of yourselves!"
2923,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: The vaccine existed for us millennials I had it.
2926,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I did that too. It was not pleasant.
2929,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I went to the ortho for shoulder pain. Massive massive shoulder pain. They gave me a steroid shot that triggered shingles on my arm back and the boob il age area. Honestly the shoulder pain was so bad I could not tell the shingles hurt at all but when I went to urgent care because of the blisters they seemed impressed at the pain I should have been in. Luckily the Val t rex work and everything cleared up but still had some nerve issues for some time after. I was 47 at the time so no vaccine for me yet. This year though
2930,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: The Shingrix shots were rough but sooo much better than the shingles. Which I got as I was heading out on a cruise at 48. So too young for vaccine and cruise ship docs are not cheap The meds halted it but what I had was awful Felt like id been kicked by a mule in my back. Get the vaccine
2936,: I knew in my heart as hard as my employer pushed and threatened that it was not for me My Son a Healthy 32 year old PA at a hospital in Illinois was forced to get the jab and nearly had a heart attack . My 83 year old mothers eyes were open quickly I am sure if he died it would have killed my mother from the pain and suffering of the loss of her only grandson When will this stop partypopper
2937,getting vaccines during a crash: If I were you and I am not you I would wait a few more weeks to see if I felt better enough to so that it would not be torture. My experience with vaccines preand post CFS is that I should only get one vaccine at a time and not get a vaccine if I am sick with something else. I once got a shingles shot when I was having serious stomach troubles. It was a very rough week after that Do what you need to do.
2940,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did not have a ton of lesions and only one scarred. But from what my folks tell me and in the photos I looked absolutely miserable. Mainly flulike symptoms and a smattering of pox. I slept a lot and was a bit cranky at my little party apparently. But other than that little scar on my back I have no recollection...for which I am very grateful
2943,Shingles vaccine experience: It hurt. Better than going blind though
2945,Is Moderna39s FluCovid Combo Vaccine Safe? Here39s What They Didn39t Test in Phase 3 Trials: Uhhhh NO I was only sick once in a couple of years before I was 24 then went into the Navy and because of the flu shot I was sick twice a year for two weeks
2946,Shingles? Rinvoq?: Thanks so much for your reply. I thought Id update you as I tried to update post but cannot seem to manage it and it may help in the event of shingles after your kind reply. Because I have spondyloarthritis so I suffer from costochondritis but ribs on the other side enthisitis in knees ankles etc. and sacriolliac and spine problems I had four discs removed As I Have experienced shooting nerve pain before I initially thought it was thoracic nerve irritation after booster but Id never had it in that location before. Luckily because rheumatologist had warned me and I had valtrex in the house for cold sore after I checked CDC Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins website which said pain can occur before rash I took 1gm of Valtrex that night I posted my questions and again during the nightearly morning when I woke with stabbing pain in the same detmatone area left flank The next morning I took another 1mg because I got the pain again. I contacted my doctor and she prescribed a 7 day dose of Valtrex. After 2 days of valtrex the shooting pain seems to be gone. Interestingly whilst researching if shooting pain can occur before shingles rash which it can I stumbled upon research that showed that herpes virus including hhv6 is significantly more prevalent in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and its thought that herpes viruses are involved in arthritis inflammation so a course of valtrex antiviral might be good overall thanks again
2948,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: yep same. My parents could not pay attention enough to know that I had chicken pox then got sent to one of these things as a young teen and developed shingles shortly after. a month long rash and 2 years of post herpetic neuralgia because my parents were idiots
2951,"Daughter's teacher, triple vaxxed, now has a stutter. Daughters friend's grandfather, triple vaxxed, now randomly says ""whoooop"" a few times an hour, like someone with Tourette's.: The teacher is in her early 60s. She was real gung-ho about the vax. She got shingles after the first two jabs. The booster seems to have given her a stutter. The grandfather is otherwise healthy and ""with it"", for a guy in his late 70s. The ""whoooop"" only started after the booster. It is like a Rick Flair whoop, but not as loud or drawn out. Anyone else hearing of stuff like this?"
2953,41 and got Shingles: I got it in my 20s and its a bitch
2957,Shingles vaccine second dose: I have not had a second one. Doctor told me the one using now is better than what they used to use. I did not get sick but my arm hurt like a bitch for several days
2958,Should I get HPV Vaccine? Questions concerns and paranoia: Same boat as you mate especially when Covid one gave me myocarditis
2959,my hub had a shingles shot and he could not use his arms for a week....it was so scary and thank GOD that was right before CV.....he is retired military and they usually just put out their arm and do not ask questions.....He has changed also
2960,Could the Covid Vaccine Because Cancer?: Lymphomas appear to be very common after these shots. Shingles has risen as they were given as have other viruses. Covid has ramped up after the shots. This is the biggest medical disaster in human history that is still being covered up by MSM and our resident idiot Garth Wetpants here
2962,Put me out of my misery.: I had ocular shingles in June. I was hospitalized for 3 days and I was on disability for 9 weeks. I am still struggling with eye problems and facial and scalp pain. Trust me you made the right decision getting it.
2963,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got shingles 2.5 weeks ago on my face and head. Miserable does not even begin to describe it. It was around my eye but luckily not in it. I am still not back to 100. I am in my midforties and was down for a week solid. It is no joke.
2965,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in the 60s had a decent case of chicken pox when I was about 7 or 8. Last year got the first shingles vaccine and 10 days later got shingles
2966,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: Duuude. I Am in a similar boat. I have a marathon on Oct 6 and I Have been stepping up my mileage. I drank a few beers at a Monday night concert and thought I was just hungover with a headache and then I got what I thought were pimples on my sideback and a few in the front but I kept getting more. I ran 4 miles and after that my back muscles killed and my butt. Could Not sleep well. My wife suggested shingles four days later and all the online research shows I have it. Contacted the doc to get an appointment but now I Am 6 days after initial symptoms. I Am almost 41 and thought I was too young to be worried about shingles. Going To try to start running again in another week but maybe cycling will have to do for now. Hope you can get at least one of your races in.
2968,"Has anyone else here developed a rash after getting the flu shot? I got the flu vaccine a while back, and recently I noticed a painful rash on my side which turned out to be shingles. I've heard some people mention a connection between the flu shot and shingles, but my symptoms didn't show up until weeks later. Anyone else have a delayed reaction like this?"
2970,Age 22 Sex Female Location Canada Preexisting conditions acid reflux problems Medications Marvelon birth control pill Nexium 40mg Apologies if photos are not the best quality.. I first noticed this big ring rash on my shoulder 11 days ago. I did not think much of it at the time and decided to give it a few days to see if it would go away on its own. It did not so I made an appointment with my family doctor but she is notoriously hard to get in with so my appointment is not until the end of March. Then this past Monday 6 days after the ring rash showed up I noticed multiple of these little red spots on my waistline area and one on my arm. I found it strange but they were not bothering me so I went on with my day. It was not until Wednesday night when they started to itch a little bit. Since then my only symptom has been very mild itching in that area. Nothing too uncomfortable. Today I decided to just go get it checked out. there is a pharmacy care clinic near my house where the pharmacists are allowed to assess minor things. I went and the pharmacist assessed my rashes and she said that the ring shaped one on my shoulder looks like ringworm but she is concerned that the rash on my waistline area looks like shingles. She asked me if I have ever had chicken pox and I said no. I have had all my vaccinations too. She also asked if I noticed any fluid in the blisters and I said no. I also have not had any pain whatsoever. I was shocked to hear that I may have shingles considering that my symptoms which has been only some mild itching are barely there. She did prescribe me an antiviral medication I do not remember the name i have to go pick it up in a couple hours but she said there can be some unpleasant side effects. She also recommended an OTC antifungal for the ringworm. I am just questioning the shingles diagnosis since it seems unusual even the pharmacist was a little puzzled. I would like a second opinion. Thank you in advanced
2971,Hi 36 years old male for the context I am really desperate about finding a solution for what I am suffering from... In 2019 I had what the dermatologist thought was shingles on my thorax. But it was a roundshaped cluster of blisters which resolved quite quickly after taking Acyclovir both pills and cream. In August 2023 I got infected by some virus after sexual intercourse that gave me pain during urination and 40C fever for a few days. After having being tested negative for Chlamydia Gonorrhea HIV Syphilis I took Acyclovir because I thought it could be genital herpes. The night following the first dose I suffered from very painful intercostal neuralgia and I woke up with a side stitch that lasted for 2 weeks and bilateral sciatica that lasted for a while too... But fever immediately stopped. Which makes me thing it was herpesrelated. Then in September 2023 I had another outbreak in my upper back similar as the one of 2019. Same I used Valacyclovir and it resolved quickly both pills and cream. And then... since January 2024 I keep suffering from burning sensations neuropathic pain with allodynia below my left arm first and then around my right hip and thigh.. which I treated with Valacyclovir because I thought it could be shingles without a rash zoster sine herpete. It stopped and then came back.. and since then I have been experiencing this burning sensation at least once every 2 weeks or sometimes more  An infectiologist prescribed me with 500mg  day of Valacyclovir but it changed nothing. I even tried 3g  day during 5 weeks without any improvement. I also had a burning sensation below my right arm which led to an intense neuralgia that lasted for 2 weeks  It was a nightmare... To finish this post I have to say that last November 2 I had another circleshaped cluster of blister appearing in my upper back without prior notice like the 2 previous ones 2019 and 2023 which I treated with Valacyclovir 3g  day  Acyclovir cream. Quick resolution even if I sometimes still feel some neuralgia in my upper back. And last Sunday something new happened  I had my classic burning sensations occurring under my left arm and then it started burning on my left thigh external side and after a few days of burning a circleshaped cluster of blisters appeared  So I now have the proof that the burning sensations that I am experiencing for almost a year now are related to a herpesvirus. It still remains unclear to me what herpesvirus it is  is it VZV or is it HSV2 that I may have caught back in August 2023 after sexual intercourse ? Yesterday I asked a lab to do a PCR on my blisters not sure if it will work as the blisters already started drying a little bit and I put Acyclovir regularly on it. Still yesterday an Internal Medicine Specialist hypothetized that this virus mutated to become resistant to Acyclovir especially because of Acyclovir cream which according to her often causes resistance prescribed me with Valgancyclovir Gancyclovir which is apparently a more efficient and more toxic drug against herpesvirus and which is extremely expensive. About toxicity she told me you are young it should be ok but I will not stay young forever therefore I am very worried about my future  does it mean I will not have a long life ?... what about this struggle against herpesvirus when I am old ? Last information  all of what happened since January happened while taking Valacyclovir 500mgday or more B12 3x 250g daily morning noon evening D3 50g daily morning C 1000mg daily morning LLysine 4x 800mg daily 2x morning noon evening... My Anti HSV1 IgG is 0.2 negative but I already had several cold sores in my life  How can I understand this ? My Anti HSV2 IgG is 0.6 negative but there again I am very skeptical My Anti HSV IgM is My Anti VZV IgG is 2229 mUIml positive My Anti VZV IgM is  0.8 negative And my immunology test showed a functional immune system I am not immunocompromised. So my question is  Can Famcyclovir be a good alternative for me ? As it is less toxicbrutal than Valgancyclovir  Can I try Cimetidine as a preventive treatment ? If yes what posology ?  What about SADBE ? I have read that it only a topical treatment...  What can be the root causes ?? Treating is good but.. what isare the root becauses ?  I experienced several atrial fibrillations in the past I am taking Flecaine daily to avoid recurrences... therefore my body already showed some unusual things for a young person. Could be related to stress people say. Maybe stress is the because of both atrial fibrillations and herpesvirus activations ? But I do not feel stressed... except when I have endless recurrences of course this is putting me in a vicious cycle It is still unsure for me if it is VZV or HSV I hope the PCR will work but I really feel hopeless... and very worried for my future. Thanks in advance for your help
2975,Shingles and other Vaccines: I think it really depends on a number of factors but for the most part Covid vaccines do help prevent serious symptoms or complications especially in some people prone to illness or weaker immune systems. I get what you are saying though. I get really bad reactions from flu vaccines much worse than whenever I Have had the flu so I do not get that anymore. Everyone is different.
2978,At the near tail end of my 5 years I got Shingles. 1st month felt punky then broke out ulnar nerve left arm. Not too bad but bad enough. Then brain fog fatigue for 2 years.Get your shingles shot
2982,GP autonomic dysfunction after shingles?: Interesting I had a severe case of shingles in 2021 that resulted in PHN. In 2023 I was diagnosed via the smart pill with gastroparesis and pots tilt table test. Thank you for bringing it up now I Am curious about possible connections. I Am so sorry you have experienced similar. I know its been a wild ride for me. Editing to add shingles for me was atypical from my right lower back down my entire right leg. I lost the ability to walk for over a year. The acute phase was miserable I would not wish it on my worst enemy. You Are a rockstar for what you have been through
2984,Shingles vaccine: I had the shingles series of shots with no associated illness. The only odd thing for me is I still get shingles a couple times a year in a small spot only in an area on the top left buttox so I keep a prescription of Valtrex which minimizes and shortens the outbreak. Lucky Me.
2985,Hi everyone first time shingles sufferer here and confused about the dosage of meds. noticed a few small red itchy bumps on Sunday there was no pain beforehand saw doctor on Wednesday because rash was larger angrier and incredibly itchy and slightly painful. Doctor immediately diagnosed it as shingles and prescribed antibacterial cream and oral antivirals valacyclovir label on pills from pharmacy says take one pill once daily for 30 days and the pills are 1000 mg when I went to pick it up the pharmacist mentioned genital herpes and I corrected him and said no this is for shingles my rash is still quite angry and itchy and has not really improved at all today is Saturday from everything I Have read online and in this sub it seems like the correct dose for SHINGLES is to take the 1000mg pill 3x a day for 7 days wondering if I should call my doctor just in case the pharmacy made an error or if anyone else has been prescribed the same dose? I do not know what reason my dose would be different. I am not on any other meds and not immuno compromised or anything. Thank you
2986,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I would rather take a long weekend than 6 weeks off of work. I would not be able to do my job if shingles appeared on certain part of my body such as an armpit or near that area which is fairly common. I cannot be the only one. I had shingles before but it did not hit my armpit or that area fortunately so I was able to move my arms. I do not want to count on that again because it can be different the next time so I got the vaccine. Please also do not forget that every once in awhile someone can go blind in one eye for example and if they are male well it is pretty rare but it can appear in surprising places. Unless someone has contradictions against it I think it is worth a shot in the arm.
2989,"Likelihood of catching chickenpox from someone with shingles? I've been vaccinated.: Hello docs, I \[24F, no existing medical issues or medications\] was fully vaccinated for chickenpox as a child, and my mother \[52F\] developed shingles about a week ago. Mom has been staying in a separate room and keeping the rash covered to limit the risk of transmission, but I've been really worried about catching chickenpox myself, since everything I've read about shingles seems to imply that it's contagious for longer than chickenpox is. What are the chances of someone vaccinated for varicella 20+ years ago catching chickenpox via shingles exposure? :("
2991,Rinvoq and shingrix: I got the shin gri x on week one of r in vo q and although I was still flaring pretty bad I did not see any changes after the vaccine
2992,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Did she have chicken pox too?
2995,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: This not medical advice just something that helped me when I had shingles. I used when I had shingles and it helped with the pain immensely. Willow bark is where aspirin comes from and that is like a topical pain reliever arnica is a topical antiinflammatory that also relieves pain and the menthol crystals sort of confuse the nerve cells so that what your brain is paying attention to is the tingling sensation of the menthol instead of the burning pain of the shingles. You could get the same effect from just using something like vicks vaporub and that would be fine too it just would not have the addition of the pain relievers you can also get something like willow bark as a pain reliever in aspercream which is an aspirin based topical pain reliever. I was lucky my shingles cleared up in about 2 weeks using this salve multiple times a day may have helped it heal faster i do not know but it definitely made it less painful and more comfortable while I was suffering.
2999,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Do you realize you can also get shingles from the vaccine? I am immunocompromised and had to be vaccinated against it only because I had the chicken pox vaccine.
3000,How do I get over my fear my LO is going to get sick?: Came to ask this as well. My daughter just has RSV at 9 months. Thankfully she was vaccinated at 6 months. I thought she just had a bad cold. Would Not have enough thought RSV had I not had her tested. Even her pediatrician was surprised. But it kept her safe and out the hospital. I was so thankful.
3001,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: If you had a strong reaction to the first one a lot of people including myself do not feel nearly as bad after the second. The reverse is often true for those who had little reaction to the first one.
3002,RSV vaccine: Yep Just got RSV and covid yesterday at 33 wks
3003,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had a rare presentation of shingles back in 2016 in my larynx. It took a week to diagnose after ruling out strep and mono and was finally identified by the head of Otolaryngology at Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary I am thankful that I live near great hospitals. He said he would never seen it only read about it. It was the worst medical issue I have ever had and I would had a spinal fusion just 4 weeks prior. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. Unbearable pain constant severe nausea I had to be put on IV fluids for dehydration because I could not even keep water down I lost 20 lbs in three weeks. I was on liquid oxy for at least a month bright side constipation is not an issue when you consume nothing and produce no solid waste. I really believed I was going to die. Now I have damage to my 9th and 10th cranial nerves. The aftermath was initially violent coughing triggered by the ongoing nerve pain for a couple of years which has subsided a bit but still occurs several times a day. I could not put a Qtip or airpod in my right ear for several months without abruptly vomiting. I still vomit a lot especially when I am having a coughing fit. That doctor at Mass Eye Ear warned me that I would experience symptoms for a long time possibly permanently. It looks like he was right. I advise anyone who is eligible for the shingles vaccine to get it right away. Even regular shingles sucks but if you get special shingles like me and the person I am responding to it can fuck up your life. Incidentally my mom told me I did not have chicken pox when I was a kid my case must have been so mild that we mistook it for something else.
3004,So I developed it a couple weeks ago now I am in the tail end. Only got a small rash with about ten bumps on my back in an area of about 3cm by 5cm. There was burning itching not so much. Felt like crap the day before it developed and had a bad lower back pain. I am thinking about getting the vaccine but I would have to pay out of pocket because my country does not cover it for people too young. What are your experiences with the vaccine? Has anyone had subsequent flare ups? Have flare ups gotten worse over time?
3005,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles up the upper left quadrant of my face from my view. My cornea is forever slightly damaged because of it. I Have broken my ankle and ripped my quad muscle pretty bad. Quad was horrible but shingles was worse. Its nerve pain and when at least for me where it was on my face I had electrical shocks running through my brain. Luckily over the counter meds at high doses completely dealt with it. Otherwise it was so bad that Id have a shock every 13 seconds and the shock took 100 of my focus. I could not drive. My ophthalmologist and standard practitioner both made jokes about how I was too young to have it 35. It was terrible. If you are reading this I highly suggest you make yourself familiar with the symptoms so that you can spot it early. I might be blind in my left eye had I not happened to speak to someone early on that identified it. Side note I most likely got it because I had gotten some shots a week or two before symptoms. I had basically gotten unlucky that my TDAP flu and MMR vaccine were up. I was also graduating college working full time and had a new born. All the stress let it flare up. My doctor and I had a good laugh about how my shingles were caused by vaccines.
3013,I had Shingles end of January omfg worst pain ever Vaccine me up
3018,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: congratulations the second one sucks but still better than shingles
3023,Newbie here: Sorry you got shingles it sucks. I am just getting over mine from two weeks ago . I had mind on my left side of my arm. All I got was shooting pain an I could not barely pick up anything or barely touch anything cold or I would get shooting pain again.. mine is in the blister stage now. Get some Camille lotion for the itching an do not itch the shingles or take hot showers.
3024,I had no reaction to the shingles vaccine but had one to my first flu vaccine back in the 1970s. Go figure.
3025,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I took both Shingrex shots years ago without any discomfort. My arm wasn't sore. I ""never get sick."" But back in January I caught Influenza-A and I thought I was on death's door. Horrible and goes to show you just never know."
3028,Ugh I must vent: I have had shingles on my head twice in the last two years. I usually do not do well with vaccines because of mast cell disease but I got vaccinated and I hope I never have to deal with shingles again. The first time I was diagnosed it was through telemedicine. I had clear pictures and had no trouble getting the prescription. The second time it was in my ear and behind it and as soon as I mentioned ear camera the telemedicine doctor refused to even look at the pics. I went to the walk in clinic I prefer and at first she thought it was some kind of nasty ear infection but I told her it felt like shingles so she took another look and also looked at the ear camera photos and said I was right and prescribed antivirals. You can take pictures of rashes for telemedicine just cover anything that is a private area for you and take close up pics. Usually in person they will want to see the rash even if you bring photos. Everyone has a butt though and doctors have seen thousands of them. It may feel like a big deal to show it but for the doctor it is not a big deal to see it.
3029,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not know if I was taken to a party or just got it my parents and I do not talk but I also have shingles. Two outbreaks within six months and it is MISERY. The first time I recognized some of the symptoms because they were similar to how my cold sores show up but the second was an unusual presentation that took ten days to diagnose and almost a month to fully recover.
3036,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Sam. I got shingles at 18 and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I asked my doctor about getting the shingles shot and he said I cannot until I am minimum 50 years old. The day I turn 50 I am getting that damn thing. I still have nerve pain around my back from it and I have to watch my stress levels super closely. I find if I am getting stressed the nerves start firing and it feels like ants crawling across my back. It is a warning. I thought shingles was an old person disease til I got it 23 years ago.
3041,I have gotten several people to get their Shingles vaccine. My doctor is referring me to a specialist because mine is not remitting at all.
3043,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I had them 5 years ago. It was a pain in the ass literally Chemo wrecks your immune system.
3045,Shingles Is NO Joke: Had that when I was younger and it sucked so bad
3049,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: I had shingles. It sucked s ooo much. Not going to lie both shots kicked my butt. But I could schedule the suck and that is WAY better.
3055,Shingles vaccine?: I am starting my vaccine series in December after getting shingles this summer. I do not care if the vaccine knocks me out for a week it would still be better than the hell that is shingles. I am still having random nerve pain from it.
3056,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: shingles by the way come from having had the chickenpox and it is an excruciating sickness. may trish suffer repeatedly
3064,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: True. At least Ill know what to expect the next time. I was so naive thinking Id be just a little tired lol
3066,Is it me or is every medication for this condition and its symptoms horrific?: I got shingles at 24yrs in summer late 1990s due to stress. I thought it was a heat rash for two weeks. Hurt like a MFr I do not like Valtrex either makes me so nauseous. I used ice packs and now there are lidocaine sprays which could help soothe some of the burning. I recently found out my liver metabolizes meds pretty quickly that is why some make me feel like I want to rip off my skin or crawl in a dark hole. I hope you heal up quickly and never have to experience this nasty virus again. I plan on getting the shingles vaccine next year.
3069,Shingles Is NO Joke: I have had it twice. Both times on my face moving towards my eye. So painful. I have no sense of smell or taste because of nerve damage. I have been told it could all come back as my nerves regenerate. But the pain is something I never want to experience again
3072,I Have never reacted to any vaccine poorly in my whole life until the Shingles vaccine. About half the people I know developed flu like symptoms after the vaccine. Id split them up a couple weeks apart.
3073,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Got shingles in March and currently still fighting it has lasting nerve damage and constant burning itching. I scratched so bad yesterday I started bleeding pretty bad in a Belk's where someone asked me if I needed paramedics as I bled through my shirt and just thought I was sweating. Shingles sucks and will be one of the most painful rashes you will experience. Edit if people want pictures of the gnarly bleeding mess of a rash I have a few I could post. It makes you look like you have the Black Plague.
3074,Shingles vaccine experience: My wife and I did the same with our shingles shot shots. Scheduled late in the week in case it was more than some soreness.
3076,Shingles vaccine: Oh that sounds awesome Id like to not have to take it if its as bad as the chicken pox was for me. Which was not horrific or anything just 60 days of aches and fatigue and so annoying.
3077,Shingles? Rinvoq?: Thanks so much for your reply. I thought Id update you as it may help in the event of shingles. Because I have spondyloarthritis so I suffer from costochondritis but ribs on the other side enthisitis in knees ankles etc. and sacriolliac and spine problems I had four discs removed As I Have experienced shooting nerve pain before I initially thought it was thoracic nerve irritation after booster but Id never had it in that location before. Luckily because rheumatologist had warned me and I had valtrex in the house for cold sore after I checked CDC Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins website I took 1gm of Valtrex that night I posted and again during the nightearly morning when I woke with stabbing pain in the same detmatone area left flank The next morning I took another 1mg because I got the pain again. I contacted my doctor and she prescribed a 7 day dose of Valtrex. After 2 days of valtrex the shooting pain seems to be gone. Interestingly whilst researching if shooting pain can occur before shingles rash which it can I stumbled upon research that showed that herpes virus including hhv6 is significantly more prevalent in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and its thought that herpes viruses are involved in arthritis inflammation so a course of valtrex antiviral might be good overall.
3081,30F shingles on the face: I have not had the itchiness yet mostly burning so I cannot say. Mine are currently on my back and around my right side. The dr. prescribed nerve pain medication gabapentin and its finally been helping day 5. How it was explained to me was that we are contagious when the sores blister and pop the people who have never had chickenpox and no vaccine. If someone has the chickenpox vaccine it was told to me that they are fine because they cannot get shingles if they have never had the chickenpox but err on the side of caution.
3082,Shingles vaccine: I Have taken the shingles vaccine and while I felt a little crummy for 2 days I consider it much less trouble and discomfort than the shingles cases I have heard of.
3086,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Man shongles suck. I had it twice it is so fucking painful I hope you will feel better soon
3088,I had no side effects from the Shingles vaccine. And I have not had Shingles.
3091,Second Shingles Shot: I have got an appointment on the 23rd to get shingles flu and Covid vaccines. Had shingles itself about 8 years ago. It was a mild case the rash was about the size of a half dollar but holy hell did it hurt I felt like fire was constantly shooting through my armpit and out my nipple on that side. Definitely do not want a round 2.
3093,"Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? Doesn't make sense to me......: Did you have to get a waiver to get the vaccine? They refuse to let me have the vaccine. They say I can't have it until I'm 50, I'm 34, and have had shingles twice in the last 6 years. I'm still getting over the 2nd round."
3095,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shingles vaccines were rough. I do not usually have a problem with vaccines but those were bad.
3098,I almost lost 2 teeth to shingles.: I am so sorry you are going through this. I have it on my face four little dots now scabbed over. I have pain in my ear but no blisters there. I read this on another forum and the woman said it feels like you are gibing birth through your ear and being tazed at the same time. Seems accurate. The pain is in my temples head and ear canal. It is stabbing shooting like electric shocks. I was in the ER too. Doc did not connect my headaches as shingles until I went to a walkin clinic for what I thought was a staph infection. Then my doc connected the two albeit 10 days later as shingles. It is been miserable. I am about 15 days in? I do not even remember anymore. Nothing touched the pain initially except the migraine cocktail I got at the ER and the toradol shot the next day. And that only worked for six hours. This week ibuprofen is keeping the pain at bay though I do have a gabapentin script I can use. Hope the pain lessens soon. This shit is no joke.
3099,First Time w Shingles really struggling: So none of those doctors mentioned to me that topical steroids can because scarring . My rash was extensive upper right torso in front of arm pit over shoulder completely across right side of back neck and into hairline. All of that area is STILL covered by raw skin that itches worse than anything. It is red and pockmarked. The doc prescribed clobetasol propionate which is ridiculously strong but really takes down the inflammation and itching. He told me I can use it 14 days 2x per day then take 3 days off then I can start again. Those 3 days off just about killed me with the itching and anyone who thinks you can just will yourself not to scratch has lost their mind. The skin in front of my arm looks kind of discolored but since the skin is healed it is not painful or itchy. The rest is still bad so I still take gabapentin and the ointment. I even had a biopsy to make sure there was no zoster virus left it was negative. No one knows why the healing there has stalled. The dermatologist kind of shrugged gave me more ointment. The pain for weeks was so horrific this really is not that bad in comparison. But I totally see why they do not want you to use ointment close to your eyes Cannot believe I did not think of that. Thing is it is a virus that is almost exclusively triggered by stress either physical like cancer or emotional. It kind of made me rethink some things reprioritize other things. I would not wish this on my worst enemy though But maybe it is a call to take care of yourself better than you have been. I cannot imagine the stress of law school. Hopefully this does not mess up your studies too much.
3100,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: As someone who got shingles at 20 and for the past decade has gotten neuralgianeuropathy that just decides to force random nerves at random locations around my body to fire at 1010 pain signals at random indeterminate intervals...that lady can get fucked and I sincerely hope she got litigated for everything she owns. This child's life could be endless pain like mine because of what she did
3101,Shingles vaccine: Nope. I was fine and Moderna kicked my sss.
3108,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles before I was 50. Horrible rash pain nothing I could do to sleep through the night. My rash also was on my face looked like a slap mark so my very kind very good husband got glares. Run do not walk to get Shingrix. Ask the pharmacist for any possible financial help offered by the manufacturer or other companies.
3109,I Am currently experiencing very intense itchy that has prevented me from sleeping and I Am fearing the pain is next. I Have also been very tired and fatigue easily. The rash is currently on my left leg on the side and upper hip. So far they are relatively small size of my hand compared to some of the pictures I Have seen here. I was prescribed valtrex but wondering if I can take Benadryl along with it? The itching is so intense and I Have only been using cold compresses. Any and all advice is welcome should I be preparing for blisters to get worse and painful? I Have been stressed about work and paying for college alot lately and my partner lost his job. I was vaccinated against and exposed to had chickenpoxs as a kid. My mom took me around abunch of other kids when they had chickenpox with my brothers. One of my brothers got shingles when he was 21.
3110,Just had a pneumonia vaccine yesterday today I get huge flare and pain in my whole body: Yep Next round I Am debating all three RSV pneumonia Shingles or breaking them up. I heard Shingles is not a fun one. I Have had shingles at 21 to. Pretty mild but I definitely do not want it again.
3121,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I second this Avoid foods high in arginine and take Llysine 1000mgx3. Nuts and seeds are the devil when you have shingles. Ice packs helped me particularly at night and cannabis in any form may give you a few hours sleep. You poor thing I could not work at all for two weeks and had to rest at frequent intervals for 4 months. Still suffering from severe fatigue. Look after yourself now in order to shorten the duration. People do not get it unless they have experienced this horrendous virus. Hang in there
3122,"Shingles at 37: It's never too early to get your shingles vaccine. ?? This wasn't even on my radar. I got a weird rash and thought I was having a reaction to my new pen needles or something. When the fatigue, body aches and unpredictable blood sugar started I decided to go to the doctor. Now the pain is kicking in after two weeks. Has anybody else had shingles? Apparently having T1D makes it more likely for you to get it. Any experience on Valtrex? I should be picking up the prescription tomorrow so we will see how that goes. I just want to sleep without my body trying to destroy itself for once. ??"
3125,55F very healthy though slightly overweight right now. Exhausted from preThanksgiving travel new job hosting Thanksgiving. First shingles vaccine scheduled today I put off til tomorrow but wonder if its a good idea. HRV very low and temp elevated significantly though still below 99f. There is never a good time for this vaccine and yet I Am worried its going to push me further under
3128,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: My wife got stress induced shingles in grad school and my MIL got shingles recently and it is causing encephalitis. Definitely get your shingles shot if you have it available to you. It sounds like the absolute worst.
3131,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in '73 genx sorry. I actually got it twice. Once when I was 7 or 8ish. It was a very mild outbreak that only gave me a few bumps on my cheststomach. Second time I was around 10 and had a full blown outbreak. I had a cast on my left arm that had to be removed a couple weeks early because I was devolping super chicken pox under there. Those things were fucking enormous. Did not do the pox party thing my mom thought that was dumb. Just caught from kids at school that had not started getting the bumps yet. I was not aware that a vaccine had been developed until it was time to vaccinate my daughter in the late 90's. Get your kids vaccinated people.
3133,Shingles and other Vaccines: Ugh my husband and I had shingles within a few weeks of each other within weeks of Covid lockdowns starting. We know how to have a good time in our house apparently.
3139,I had my shingle shots 2 years ago and did not have any problems at all slight sore arm. The Covid shot will be this Friday coming hoping that the side effects are minimal to none as last year.
3141,Just curious if any other people my age in this forum figured out why they got shingles? I was told i might be immunocompromised and I have been dealing with the worst eczema of my life these past two years. Some also say its long term side effects from the covid vaccine which i am not so sure about but I am vaccinated and got the booster back in 2022 and did get covid in 21 I think. Anyone else immunocompromised and how did you find out? I have a history of thyroid disease that runs in my family and am curious if anyone else has similar issues? I also never got chickenpox ever in my life and was vaccinated as a baby.
3142,Keytruda: Second hand experience here my sister is on Keytruda. She was initially staged 3C2 in March 2023 and completed the standard radcisplatinbrachy treatment. First posttreatment scan July 2023 revealed metastases to multiple areas lymph lung bone. Her team then started carbotaxol chemo with Keytruda and Avastin and she completed 6 cycles and remained on the KeytrudaAvastin. Today she had an appointment with her team before a Keytruda infusion Avastin dropped a couple of months ago due to side effects and they officially declared her in remission. Her thyroid showed inflammation on the PET scan earlier this week but nothing terrible there. Her team has been clear with her that in her specific case they feel that Keytruda has made the difference for her in having clean scans now officially for one year and achieving remission aka complete response. She had some bothersome side effects at the beginning of Keytruda that have disappeared cystic acne right after infusions tiredness mostly. Best wishes to you on your journey
3144,cant seem to find an answer: How long does a patient have to wait to receive their first chemo treatment once given a live vaccine (eg zoster)?: Cant seem to find a source anywhere. Its easy enough to find info that says dont get a live vaccine while on chemo but nowehere does it say how long you have to wait once getting the shot. 1 week? 1 month?
3147,I had my second shingles shot this morning. I feel fine. Absolutely zero issues beyond a slightly sore arm. I lifted weights and relaxed with a delicious white Burgundy and a pleasant afternoon with the dog. I wanted to give my sample size of one and encourage all my gen x friends to take care of your health. It becomes a job requiring attention as we age.
3149,RSV vaccine: I had mine with no reaction other than the usual soreness in my arm
3152,Diagnosed today.: Yes. I have it right now. it is exactly my same situation. Same symptoms. Mine started 6 days ago. Just above my left eye lid and a snall area on my forehead. Eye sight is perfect fine thankfully. Finally saw my doctor last night. For 2 days this week I could hardly get off the sofa. Bad fatigue awful headache above the eyes. Swollen lymph node near my left ear and some sharp shooting pains on the left side of my face. Also some nausea. I thought it was sinusitis. I had shingles when I was 20 and no pain or issues whatsover. But this time I have pain. Overactivity caused it. Doctor prescribed me valtrex. I am getting lots of sleep and rest. eating healthy. Drinking lots of water. Ill take the valtrex and put this experience behind me smilingfacewithsunglasses
3155,Shingles second vaccine: Pneumonia yes. Got it in April. That was ROUGH. I was glad I got it on a Friday. My arm swelled so bad. RA is so rough. I am just learning everyday how many systems it affects
3157,Hi First of all great group I have been reading and responding some it is time for my story. I am in my mid 60's F. Will not bore with things wrong with my back but suffice it to say led to 2 level PLIF XLIF ten years ago. Fabulous result. Standard ROUGH recovery fully healed at about 12 months. 4 weeks ago yesterday L45 instrumentation. L45 interbody cage insertion. Interbody arthrodesis with the use of allograft and autograft and fibrograft at L45. Right Iliac bone harvest for interbody fusion. Posterior lateral fusion at L45 Removal of prior instrumentation This one very rough. Apparently taking out old hardware from 2 levels and replacing dealing with scar tissue plus 2 new levels fused a little more unusual. Standard hospital stay and first week at home. OF NOTE I had a very weird whole body rash itchy spots all over back abdomen and chest. Plus 2 herpes type break out on face and lips. Surgeon PA dismissed as reaction to hibiclens which I have never had. One week post op CATASTROPHIC PAIN in L shin knee and thigh I have never ever used the term 1010 pain till then. Felt like grizzly bears were eating my leg. Spent Thursday Sunday desperately messaging surgical team. come to find out my surgeon was freaking OUT OF THE COUNTRY no response from them. Monday called finally spoke to doc covering for my surgeon. Go to ER which I did. Long story short admitted and the on call doc was a savior. Told me he was going to 'think outside the box and throw everything on the wall.. Turns out was a postherpetic neuralgia a shinglestype virus was activated and attacking my already irritated spinal nerve. Switched me from gabapentin to Lyrica put me on Valcyclovir gave me 2 IV doses of Toradol. I was jonesing for that 2nd dose of Toradol Of course doc is against NSAIDs but man that worked better than any pain medicine Back home after 3 days TylenolmethocarbinolLyrica around the clock every 8 hours. 12 days later I have decreased the Tylenol to twice a day since I already have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and really high enzymes. Titrated oxy from 10 to 5mg twice a day to once a day to off totally at 4 weeks. Something that REALLY HURT was getting up from lying down to upright. I still use a walker. It seemed my back really hated the transition from horizontal to vertical. I dreaded going to bed fearing getting up. SO. I ordered a wedgerecliner thing for sleeping. Night and Day I no longer scream getting up for the day or going to bathroom at night. I feel I have finally turned a corner. Was feeling a little despair. Have learned Nerve pain REALLY SUCKS
3165,Just awful for you Ian. I had four people close to me get Shingles last year. All within 6 mths of having Covid19 I might add. The vaccine is bloody expensive if you are under 65 but I got it and am so glad I did. I hope the meds kick in soon.
3167,I had the first dose and never got the second one. It was that horrible. Maybe I will get the courage again because I do not want shingles
3169,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I got shingles at 33 a couple of months ago on my leg no less which meant walking was a true challenge. Truly horrible shit
3171,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Got mine mid thirties due to stress. One of the worst pains in my life. Its like being burned from the inside. And now that we had it at risk for it coming back later. Yay.
3172,One reaction does not predict the next. I Have heard some people react to one dose but not the other. I did not have any reaction to any vaccine Covid boosters or shingles. But as bad as you might get feel now shingles is ten thousand times worse
3173,Shingles vaccine experience: I have not seen any of the other posts you are referring to but I am really glad you did not let them dissuade you. Of course there are going to be some people who have an unusually bad reaction to vaccines  but they are a very small minority. For almost everyone else the worst thing that happens is a sore arm and some mild cold symptoms. Very much worth it compared to the disease you are protecting yourself against. Also what is often left out when people are scaremongering about vaccine side effects is that many of the bad reactions vaccines can because are the same thing that the disease itself will do to you but the reaction to real infection is usually worse. For example much has been made of the risk of myocarditis from the Covid vaccines. This does happen in a small number of cases and obviously myocarditis is not something you want. But Covid infection also causes myocarditis and it is usually way worse than what you might get from a vaccine. So even if you account for the small chance of bad reactions it is still worth it to get vaccinated. Now obviously there are some exceptions to this like if you suffer from some very specific allergies that a vaccine can trigger. But this risk is mitigated as well  if healthcare providers know that you have one of these allergies they will advise you not to get the vaccine and you would better hope the people around you did. This is also why they ask you to remain in the office for 15 minutes after the shot in case there is an unexpected allergic reaction. vaccine sentiment is one of the dumbest most counterproductive things in modern society. Thank you for not being duped by it.
3174,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: During my shingles experience when the hip patch spread down over my left thigh I looked at the shingles blisters that covered my tummy and weirdly INSIDE my belly button the excruciating pain and I said to them do not you dare... they did not dare. Shingles blisters across the nips and in the bellybutton were bad enough. Yikes. I am so sorry.
3175,Under 35 with Shingles?: My partner 27 years old got Shingles on his neck. I used to think this was an old persons illness but turns out younger people are getting it.
3182,PSA shingrix zoster vaccine recombinant adjuvanted is now free for almost everyone: Driving me up the wall just like COVID19 BOO
3188,Shingle vaccine before JAK inhibitors?: Get the vaccine. I am fucking serious. I have permanent nerve damage from getting shingles after starting immuno suppress I have treatment. My doctor did not tell me to get the vaccine ahead of time.
3190,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Chickenpox is one of my very first memories. I had a couple get very infected on my legs and turn a bright shade of green. Still have the scars.
3194,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Had them in my 30s. Absolutely awful and I had a fairly minor case on only one side of my chest and only in a small line. I got the original shingle vaccine then Shingrix when it came out. Never want it again.
3195,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: This is good to know. I also got it about 3 years ago and man never again. It was uniquely awful pain.
3196,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles at 36. It sucked. I was told high stress can because it when you are young and my job was so stressful to the point where I was in a bad space mentally. The shingles were a cherry on top. I quit that job and have not had it again in the past 6 years.
3197,Shingrix cost C174.52 per shot: Apparently you do not have underlying neuro issues. I have had two strokes effecting my left side total numbness of course the shingles are on the left side. The pain is crippling. I do not expect you or anyone to understand stroke numbness but its horrible. The blisters are not bad.
3198,I am post it all and like I mentioned in my last post I did not blister or scab. But I do have the faint marks on my skin from the rash. It is been maybe a month since you could say the rash went away and the skin that was affected does not itch or really hurt but it is sensitive. So I guess that could be considered pain but very small amounts and only on light touch or when I get goosebumps. I was told wait until shingles is over to get the vaccine. My dr is not giving me a real answer and in three weeks I am supposed to have hernia surgery on the site where I had the rash. So I got that going for me. Does anyone know how long you need to wait? Is what I have actually considered PHN or is it just sensitive? What is the mendoza line of when shingles are done? I do not want to ever get this again and if this is PHN it could be here for years. I do not want to have to wait that long. Thanks for the help in advance
3204,"Breakout on Rinvoq: I (22f) was on Humira for about three years, and I've always really struggled with acne. Magically as soon as they put me on Entyivo (not wide spectrum like humira) my skin cleared up. My skin was really sensitive, slow to heal, and extremely prone to infection and cysts. I'd also get folliculitis and red raised bumps that looked like pimples, but just were really inflamed spots. I was on a TNF inhibitor while you're on a JAK inhibitor. Not exactly the same chemical, but immunosuppressants have a super complex effect on the body. This was just my experience though, your dermatologist would probably have better answers."
3209,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Hoping to feel better for the holiday weekend.
3212,Got mine today and it hurt like a m fer. Still has to be better than getting that horrible disease.
3213,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: It can happen because it is a live vaccine with a weakened strain of the virus and it still lives forever in your nerves. So though it is even more rare than regular shingles this weakened strain can still come back to haunt you.
3220,RSV vaccine for infants.: Yeah we got it for our little one right before the weight cut off It was totally worth the peace of mind because I watched a friend's 3 month old suffer from RSV just a few weeks before. No side effects
3221,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: Mine formed in large patches up and down my left arm. So not the worst place but nerve pain in the arm was a killer cuz it was hard to use it without wanting to cry LOL.
3223,Shingles second vaccine: There was a point when I was vomiting that I had the thought i may have to go to the ER. Thank you It took until Sunday afternoon for me to feel human again
3226,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Any fatigue is better than shingles.
3229,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I am glad to hear your experience so far has been easy on you. Good luck with your second shot
3232,Realworld evidence from over one million COVID19 vaccinations is consistent with reactivation of the varicellazoster virus.  The risk of developing shingles was 0.20 for the vaccinated  0.11 for the unvaccinated. The difference was statistically highly significant P  0.0001.: i do not know how you can accuse doctors and nurses of missing known side effects when almost non will ever see them in their entire career. Why tell people about the risk of myo card it is thr ombo cyto peni a anaphylaxis Guill a in Barre or Bells Palsy then they do when i made my appointments yesterday and when i got my 2nd and 3rd i had to explain to them that i understood the risk and wanted moderna anyway they tried to schedule me for pfizer because people my age they were explaining the risk of myo card it is for moderna moderna. anaphylaxis is really only a risk for people who have had issues before. Guill a in Barre or Bells Palsy those are 1 in million type side effects and do not belong in any real risk assessment. I would shame people for anyone that thought they were to be considered in the risk assessment. I know very well myo card it is a higher risk with moderna i also understand the total risk and also compared to pfizer minimal. i want moderna i trust their vaccine more overall. iv read all of their data and know how they operate. As for the other risks they are so low they do not even matter. everyone in the world is free to read any papers they want that describe the full risk levels. id rather my doctors not spent an hour with each patients explaining them.
3236,Shingles vaccine: I had them both. I have lupus and chronic Lyme. No problems not even a sore arm. Do Not believe what you read the majority of humans are fine its the few with reactions who post complaints.
3239,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: That sucks. I got mine a few years ago. The 2nd one is a bit rough.
3241,I am particularly feeling it this morning Got my covid and flu boosters and my first shingles vaccine last night. Oye.
3245,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I just wanted to share this story because its kind of crazy. My 9 month old daughter had a terrible rash so we took her to the emergency room. Yup she had the chicken pox. I was SHOCKED. The doctors actually asked if they could bring med students in to see her because none of them had ever seen someone with it. That first year of life my daughter had open heart surgery a respiratory infection and chicken pox a week later. We put my insurance to WORK.
3247,Tell me about your vaccine flares: A covid booster is what triggered Fibro for me in the first place. My immune system got hammered with a series of events. Series of events was covid vaccine covid vaccine covid infection 1 covid 2 covid booster different brand shingles 4 weeks later then long covidFibromenopauseclusterfuck
3251,41 and got Shingles: I got them at 35 randomly. I was going through a really stressful and scary time with a mentally ill neighbor targeting me so I assume that is what triggered it. I had horrible back nerve pain for a day or two then a little itchy then finally got the rash. By then it was too late for antivirals to help much. Sorry you are going through this Hope it heals quickly.
3252,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I got the vaccine at 36 weeks. I have a history of unusual vaccine reactions so I waited as long as possible to take it. I did not have any side effects at all. Even my blood sugars were not affected. The increased risks when taking the vaccine are extremely small. I used to work in a NICUPICU and it always broke my heart to see previously healthy babies go home forever changed from the damage RSV did. I feel very grateful to be having my baby during a time where I can pass some protection on to him.
3253,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: Doc said I could resume my life including running right away if I could tolerate the pain. I think she knew that was not going to happen. Any amount of stress caused flare up any time my blood pressure rose I got flare ups. Hell even coffee and spicy foods my two weaknesses caused flare ups.
3254,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I did not have a single side effect. The flu shot hurt more.
3257,GI Issues after Covid vaccines or Covid infection. Interesting article I found.: I had covid and immediately after had issues with constipation. The issues never resolved and only got worse over time.
3258,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had two things of Chicken Pox one from New Zealand and one from the US so I had Shingles twice the first in my early 30's on the left side of my ribs and the second one in my early 40's on the left side of my face. I have not had the vaccine since I had both before it was available.
3260,Shingles shot: The only after effect I had was some arm pain feeling like someone had punched me. IIRC the pain only lasted 23 days. It did not keep me from going about my day normally.
3262,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: The vaccine was introduced in the US in 1995 in April I think. My daughter was one of the first to get it as her yearly wellness exam was coincidentally the first day that physicians began to administer it. CNN was at the pediatricians office to get Broll of little kids getting the shot with parents permission to film.. When they filmed her getting her shot she has always been photogenic with big green eyes and a riot of curly hair she did not cry just sorta frowned said ouch And that was that. Film crew was disappointed at the lack of tears and went on to other kids with more tears
3263,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got it and was vaccinated after. I Am told I can still get outbreaks where I had it previously and I have but much less severe and I know to start Valtrex immediately.
3265,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same. Then four years ago I got shingles on my lower back and they destroyed a nerve branch on my left leg. Now I have no feeling in the skin of my entire outer thigh and if I do not take gabapentin it constantly burns and can feel like someone is stabbing me with a fire poker if I stand on it too long. Yay.
3271,Hi. I had the gardasil vaccine the old one as I Am 32 yo. I had hpv 1618 in 2018 and ascus on and off for a few years but then completely resolved in 2022. However I am also immunocompromised on a medication for autoimmune disease rinvoq and now just had a pap that was 1618 negative and hpv 45 negative but high risk test was positive and the pap read LSIL. I Am really nervous and going in for a colposcopy. Is there a chance the colposcopy is negative or is it always at least CIN 1 with LSIL ? I Am nervous I will not clear it because I Am immunocompromised. I Am really upset 
3272,GenX Shingrix: I got my second one AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to get it over with but my reactions were not nearly as bad as your. . sorry you are going though it. Do not let it keep you from getting your second jab though watching someone suffer thought Shingles was bad enough. . I could not imagine actually having it. Awful shit.
3273,Shingles vaccine: I did not have a bad reaction at all to either shot. Hope you do not either.
3280,Shingles vaccine: I have had the shingles vaccine and had zero issues. This is how vaccine fear starts. A couple people have a reaction and then exaggerate it to the point that it seems a lot of people have had the reaction.
3281,How did you feel after the shingles shot? I heard it can really make you feel under the weather.
3286,Put me out of my misery.: I got my shingles shot as soon as my insurance covered it. My dad got shingles when he was about 75. When he died at 90 he was still getting pain where the rash was. This is an uncommon side effect but considering i take after him I did not want to take the chance.
3287,Shingles Vaccine: I got 1 dose of shingrix vaccine last year I took it 2 weeks after a 'flu jab. I had no side effects at all
3288,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: That second shingles shot can really knock you out but it is way better than getting the shingles.
3289,when did you first notice a difference?: About 18 hours after my first shot
3290,shingles???: How are you doing? I am also dealing with shingles right now. Rash appeared 48 hours ago. This is my second episode. It sucks Just started the antivirals hopefully I caught it soon enough.
3291,The shingles vaccine sucks.: The 2nd dose is worse but get it
3293,Shingles vaccine experience: To help prevent the sore arm what you can do is post injection move your arm A LOT. This helps disperse the liquid beyond the spot in the muscle where it was injected and moving your arm promotes blood flow.
3295,Shingles and other Vaccines: I just get a bit sore and maybe tired for a day. Not much. I get all the vaccines because I Am immunocompromised.
3298,I know a few people who immediately got shingles after shingles shot. They were glad they got the shot because they said it would have been way worse. I shit you not.
3306,"2nd Shingles shot: Just got my second shingle shot today and waiting for the side effects to kick in. First shot was pretty bad. Flu, allergy, or Covid shots never affected me at all. Taking it easy this weekend"
3308,41 and got Shingles: That Is young? I had not thought about it. I got them last year at 43 and it fucking sucked for about a week.
3309,Hi all I Am now 10 days post diagnosis and wanted to share my experience with you to help with the doom and gloom of it all. If you are young i am 26 and generally healthy a lot of the experiences you read about lean towards older or more severe cases so I thought Id share a breakdown of a more mild case. Days 13 were a very itchy sometimes sore rash. I got diagnosed probably 30 hours after the rash appeared and went straight onto Valtrex the 7 day prescription. From days 47 I had a pretty intense brain fog and spent most of my time in bed. When we talk about nerve pain I cannot call it pain such but a lot of symptoms from the nerve. My shingles were a big band across my left pelvis around to my butt so I definitely experienced some aching and numbness in the hip joint but nothing PAINFUL more like Id had a big gym class without stretching for a couple of days. I never needed prescription painkillers. Because I was on the valtrex so early the blisters never really matured. They sort of formed and slowly dried out. As the rash got a little sorer from days 36 I used ice packs. I could not recommend ice packs enough Calamine lotion was amazing for me I Am still using it to this day. Getting rid of the itching made a huge quality of life difference for me. I also took daily Vitamin CZinc vitamin D supplements. I cannot help but wonder if these supplements made a huge difference in my very mild experience. The nerve symptoms I had also included pins and needles and a weakness in my left leg did trip up the stairs twice as a result of this lol. At one point all of the muscles in my left leg just twitched of their own accord which was annoying. Today at day 10 my entire left abdomen and leg has a little bit of tenderness to the touch I know this is from the nerve but again its quite mild and easy to forget about if you are not thinking about it. I never felt a real suffering from the shingles just generally a bit unwell and I took it as a huge need to relax and destress. For about 56 weeks Id been working at the most extreme level of burnout so I really embraced the opportunity to relax and watch 78 series of housewives in 5 days. I could not encourage bed rest more. I drank 4L of water per day I really do not know why but I was craving water the entire time and the valtrex gave me a dry mouth Key takeouts from this post diagnosis EARLY the valtrex in my case stopped the shingles from maturing which completely changed my experience immunity supplements make a big difference in your recovery they do ease the symptoms of the virus in one way or another calamine lotion game changer ice packs on the rash for the paininflammation early are a GODSEND if you are young and otherwise healthy you might have a good experience with it all. Not every case is completely dreadful. your body has told you to relax and destress. If you can take all the time you can to do so. I was in bed for four days and even though I still have the rash nerve symptoms now I feel my quality of life has improved from the reflection I Have taken towards my stress and burnout levels. Sounds weird but true. If you have any questions please reach out
3310,My son started daycare at just shy of 4 months in May 2024. Hes had roseola Covid strep and at least 510 colds in the last 7.5 months. As flu and RSV cases start to increase again I Am paranoid about him getting sick again. I Am wondering how much a babys immune system strengthens once they been in daycare for over 6 months and have already had numerous sicknesses. At 11 months now he has had the first flu shot but pending his second dose. No RSV vaccine doctor did not recommend it. RSV and flu scare me the most
3314,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had shingles in my mid 40's. The lesions were on the right side of the face and right ear. It was excruciating I coworker's father went blind in one eye from it. Shingles is nothing to mess around with. I got the vaccine and had absolutely no side effects from it. Misery is optional. Get thr vaccine.
3316,"Pneumonia vaccine and MMR shot rash outbreak: I received the pneumonia vaccine and MMR shot last year, and ever since then, I've been dealing with a persistent rash outbreak. It's been uncomfortable and itchy, and I'm not sure if it's a reaction to the vaccines or something else. Has anyone else experienced this after getting these vaccines?"
3318,41 and got Shingles: Went to urgent care at old job because I thought I was stung by a wasp by my eye the doc looked at my eye and sent me to a optometrist under suspicion it was early shingles sure enough it was. Had to take a weeks worth of some russian sounding drug massive pills and was fine. Have since gotten the shingles vaccine which I encourage any here to do so with my family doc
3319,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles vaccine just hurts like a mo fo. Worse than a tetanus shot but noo side effects for me. And way less painful than getting Shingles. I was not taking a chance on that as I had the worse case of chicken pox as a child covered head to toe you could see them under my nails in my nail beds had them in y ears on my scalp. It was horrible. I would be the one to get all over Shingles.
3324,Shingles vaccine?: I had them for the same reason and had absolutely zero reaction and I alway feel rubbish after flu and Covid vaccines. I did not even get a sore arm after the shingrix ones
3325,"It just hit me that I'm not 1.5 years into this... I'm actually approaching 2 years of grappling with the aftermath of my Pfizer vaccination. The journey of being a long-hauler has been filled with ups and downs, moments of hope and setbacks that tested my resilience. After each vaccine dose, I noticed a decline in my health. Debilitating fatigue, persistent brain fog, and unexplained muscle pain became my constant companions. I brushed it off as my fibromyalgia flaring up, unaware of the true extent of the impact the vaccines had on my body. Following my fifth booster shot in May '23, my symptoms worsened drastically. Severe vertigo, chronic insomnia, and digestive issues made everyday tasks feel like insurmountable challenges. It was a wake-up call that I couldn't ignore. In the months that followed, new symptoms emerged - hair thinning, skin sensitivity, and prolonged periods of flu-like symptoms that left me drained. It wasn't until I contracted a breakthrough COVID infection in September '23 that the reality of being a long-term long-hauler hit me like a ton of bricks. Embracing this new identity as a long-hauler has been a journey of self-discovery and resilience. Accepting the challenges, seeking understanding, and fostering a sense of community have become my pillars of strength as I navigate the uncertain road ahead. #LongHaulerStruggles"
3326,Vaccinations?: Yes get all of your vaccines. My doctor tells me to every year and I always do. I have never had a reaction worse than a sore arm to any vaccine. I still got shingles even though I have had the shingles vaccine but that is really not common and my shingles would probably have been worse if I had not had the vaccine.
3327,Hiya Gosh this medication is hard to pin down. I started with 0.25 about 4 weeks ago. Had initial side effects I was struggling with but those went away after about a week. Then took 0.25 for another week and went up to 0.5 mg which seemed to be a good dose for me no side effects and I did notice very small improvement in my brain fog. My doctor who prescribed me LDN said to go up 0.25 mg every week if there are not any side effects still there so I went up to 0.75 mg after a week of 0.5 mg. The first two days I did not really notice anything major but then I started to feel like I had a flu coming on had this at 0.25 as well and by the end of the first week I developed shingles. I have never had it before so I do not know if this is a coincidence or related to the LDN but I have also been feeling pretty fatigued and I take it for MECFS which makes me unsure of how to continue. I am considering Staying at 0.75 mg for a while longer at least until the shingles is cleared and see if the excess fatigue goes away. Then go up to 1 mg Go up to 1 mg next week to see if I feel worse if yes then maybe 0.5 mg is a good dose for me Go back down to 0.5 mg again and stay there for a few months The thing is... while I did see a tiny bit of improvement on 0.5 mg I was really hopeful that a higher dose would lead to a bigger improvement. I know this is not necessarily the case with LDN but without trying a higher dose I would not know. I also know it is hard to give advice but I would really like some anyway to wrap my head around what to do next. Thank you
3329,I think a script if you are under 70. It is worth it I had a really bad case of shingles on my back thigh 7 yrs ago with no desire to have it again I got vaccine with Shingrix. Had a script and was going to buy it but Govt made it free just in time for my age group.
3332,Shingles vaccine second dose: I did not have any major reaction to either dose but the shots themselves HURT. I am good with needles and have a high pain tolerance and these shots HURT like HELL.
3334,I know everyone is different so this question may be moot to an extent but I am still curious to hear what people experience once the scabs of their rash start to darken postblisters. This is my first time having shingles I am 35 had never known this was a thing especially for people in their thirties had knee surgery 3 months ago and am still very much in recovery from it like recently eased back into walking even and still cannot runjump have to do physical therapy just to get my range of motion back so I do not know if that partly triggered the shingles or what but this is wild. I had really bad reactions to the Valtrex in my heart unfortunately so am not taking it and just trying to heal this as quickly as I can naturally started taking lysine supplements in case that will help at all..... My question is partly in regards to when the rash will go away but also about the other symptoms LIKE THE FATIGUE and I have nausea as well. This is like my 3rd week of the nonrash symptoms of extreme fatigue body ache and nausea. Is this going to go away at some point???? I am losing my mind.
3339,Shingles invited itself to my travel: I have got the same issue. I break out maybe once a year. I get it under my armpit or on my right arm hand. The armpit sucks. I found Val t rex work best for me. If I catch it early it cuts the nerve pain duration down significantly. Have you thought about talked to your doctor about the vaccine out of curios it Edit saw your other post on it that you did get the vaccine but this is your first breakout. Was it the actual shingles vaccine? it is usually not recommended for people under 50 unless it is reoccurring shingles.
3346,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Chicken pox can kill. It is more likely as an adult but babies can die. Shingles is horrific. I am 60. I had chicken pox as a kid. I got a mild case of shingles at 35 the patch was about a handspan and a serious and excruciatingly painful case 5 years ago. The second time it covered much of half of my upper body. The pain which kept me from sitting upright or standing lasted over 3 weeks and then dull pain continued for 3 months. For those who get it postshingles pain postherpetic neuralgia can last months years or forever. And this stupid bint has now sentenced her grandkid to potentially get shingles. Active chicken pox can trigger shingles in people who had chicken pox before. I hope grandma idiot suffers at least as much as I did. She deserves it. I also hope OOP talks to a lawyer to make sure grandma idiot cannot get near that child again.
3347,Me too. I got the flu shot once in my 50s got sick from it and will NEVER take it again or any damn shot to be honest with ya. I Am 65 now and when I turned 60 they started pushing shingles pneumonia tetanus and flu of course now adding COVID. There were good vaccines
3348,If this was answered somewhere else my apologies. A search was not successful for me. I have always gotten my vaccines. They are wonderful and they work. I have Long Covid. I have moderate MECFS symptoms especially fatigue brain fog PEM and more. I had two vaccines in May that sent me crashing my second shingles and my tetanus both same day. I am still recovering. Fall is coming up fast. I usually get a flu vaccine and any updated Covid vaccine Questions Do them or no? If I do them should it be one at a time? If so how much time in between? If I should not get any vaccines what do you do to keep safe? Are there any vaccine alternatives yet? I wear KN95 when out and about which is very limited. My husband wears surgical masks when shopping etc. TIA
3349,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never heard of these parties. When my youngest who is a millennial developed symptoms I called our healthcare provider to try to bring him in for a diagnosis and they said no. do not bring him in to spread it around. Like wtf do they think their role is if not to diagnose things? So I did not bring him. I think he may have had it twice the first time was mild and it came and went quickly. Without a professional diagnosis I cannot be sure. I think the second time was worse but I do not remember whether we took him to the doctor that time. No vaccine at the time. I had the chicken pox and the mumps as a kid. Dad unfortunately caught the chicken pox when I did and he was miserable with pustules inside his eyelids. There was nothing much for treatment except aspirin staying home from school and taking baking soda baths for the itching.
3354,41 and got Shingles: I had a bad case at 27. I Am allergic to a lot of soaps and fragrances so I assumed at first it was contact dermatitis. It got worse and worse. One day I was grinding coffee at my cafe job and the noise made the rash tingle in a bizarre way. I got weirded out and went to the clinic shingles and too late for antivirals to help. It lasted a month and was excruciating. I have scars. A doctor told me that it may have been triggered by exposure to chicken pox since I had a very mild case as a kid and likely had not built enough immunity to avoid catching it but since the virus was present it developed into shingles.
3357,Today seemed like an overreaction to the RSV shots. Thoughts?
3360,"I may have shingles (again) a month after getting shingles vaccine: So the first time I got shingles, it was about two weeks after my second Pfizer jab. I got the antiviral pretty early and had a mostly mild case. But I didn't want to risk getting shingles again if I needed a booster, so I got both doses of the vaccine, and two weeks after the second dose, I got the COVID booster. Now it's about a week and a half since then, and I have some symptoms the could be shingles, but I'm not sure. It's presenting completely differently from last time. Last time it started as pain in my shoulder, then within 3 days progressed to a rash across one side of my back. I went to the ER because I really didn't know what it was, and was immediately diagnosed and given the antivirals. This time (assuming it's shingles), it presented first on the back of the head/upper neck as a numb spot. I assumed I'd slept wrong. I think think it was weird that it lasted to whole day and into the next day, but I often have neck pains when I wake up, so I attributed it to that. I was until last night when a largish painful bum appeared underneath it. The bump is mildly painful, and a good section of my scalp above it is just numb. I think it's spreading. Today the area under the bump is painful to the touch, which is wasn't yesterday. I have an appointment at an urgent care this afternoon. Has anyone had shingles present like this?"
3362,41 and got Shingles: from personal experience it is not always followed by a fullblown breakout. I get the tingles when my immune system is fighting haaaard like the genuine flu or with covid oh that one was bad. the skin pain is sometimes worse then the actual flu symptoms.
3363,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I never had visible chicken pox neither did my youngest. I had shingles about eight years ago. They traveled internally along a nerve. The rash on the outside was bad the pain on the inside was horrific
3365,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: First sucked for me. Second was very mild.
3366,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: The only consolation is a shingrex booster is not necessary after your second dose. I scheduled my two doses not long before covid on fridays in anticipation of getting crushed over the weekend...which happened as I anticipated. My older sister age 60 did not get the vaccine and got shingles last year...she has been dealing with residual nerve pain which may or may not ever go away.
3371,RSV after maternal vaccine: I had the maternal vaccine and we all caught RSV when my son was about 5.5 months old. He had it easiest out of all of us. He was very stuffyrunny and had a cough but it was not ever anything too bad. He actually also had a cold and adenovirus at the same time and still did that well
3372,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles at 36 from stress. It was only moderately painful limited to my back and cleared up pretty quickly once I figured out what it was took me a week Shingles was def not on my radar and got medication. I have a friend who had it in her 30s she is the one who finally helped me realize what it was and very recently my best friends sister who is 40 just had it on her facescalpeye. So you are not alone We must be a stressed out generation
3373,Finally out of my flare loving rinvoq more than I should as it is not a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: I am 32 as well did not get vaccine. My dumbass got a tattoo 2 weeks before my remicade. Had a weird back paintightness for a couple days. Look in the mirror one morning and it was all over my left shoulder blade. Make sure to get Antivirals as soon as possible if you can sooner you start them the sooner it is gone
3374,Last WednesdayThursday I thought I would been wearing my bra too tight. Then on Friday and Saturday I had a bug bite or pimple in my bra strap area. Then on Sunday there was a cluster of rashbumps. After the kids went to school on Monday I went to urgent care. I was diagnosed with shingles but early shingles. I had an initial cluster then a second cluster. It is Wednesday now and my clusters have not gotten bigger. Antivirals since Monday. Less itchy than a mosquito bite but itchy enough I need to put lotion on. No more painful than a pulled muscle. I think early detection is key However.... I am still in early stages. Hopefully I have caught it but if the symptoms get worse I will report back.
3379,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I definitely remember this and was always confused as to why my mom actively wanted me to get sick. Never actually caught it though and eventually just got vaccinated.
3380,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My bothers MIL had it on her face and it got in her eye. Medicare would not pay for special meds so she spent 10k to get the med and save her visioneye. It worked but her vision was screwed up permanently. Really can suck.
3381,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom was a firm believer of vaccines and I got the vaccine when it was still fairly new and not a requirement for school. School came around and there was a party for chicken pox my mom wanting to make sure that if I did get it I was young she took me. I was the only one in my class to NOT get it. Vaccines work. I still have never contracted it and I am almost 32 now. I still live in fear of shingles because I have heard it is worse if you never got chicken pox and even though I am protected against it I am not against shingles.
3388,Doubling up on the vaccine and shingles vaccine may not have been the best idea. I Am completely hammered.
3389,Anyone feel like they got hit by a bus after getting Shingrix Vaccine?: Yeah. I m pretty new to the diagnosis they are just sorting out RA or PSA. But I have been fighting this for years. I have learned it s not cut and dry. Hang in there
3392,How do you handle infants during flu and RSV season?: Why do not you get the RSV shot ? I did for my then 4 months old it eliminates at least one of the crazy virus around
3393,Shingles vaccine: DO NOT GET IT THE DAY BEFORE TDAY. I was soooo sick omg
3398,4x Pfizer thinking about getting vaccine next week: Nova vaccine is the best choice. It has much less side effects longer duration of protection slightly better efficacy broader coverage of variants and is non mRNA. There are a lot of unknowns of how mRNA interacts with the body like what happened with your unfortunate outbreak of shingles which may be a result of mRNA it cannot be ruled out. I had 2 initial mRNA with bad side effects and then said no more mRNA. I took Nova vaccine as soon as it was a vai able and have since had 3 Nova vaccine with no side effects. I will only take Nova vaccine in future. I am sure you will find Nova vaccine better. Please let us know how it goes.
3400,I am 7wpp and I have been such an under supplier that I just made it to consistently getting 8oz a day. I read somewhere that the benefits of immunization are reached at 4oz of milk a day so I have been freezing a bottle and giving a bottle for almost a month. I have spent so much money on pumps and supplements that I feel guilty for wanting to stop. However every time I seem to hit a groove something comes up to ruin the rhythm. Either healthwise for me postpartum preeclampsia for my husband a heart attack scare and undiagnosed sleep apnea making it difficult to get support since our families live so far away or environmental our dog getting sick and needing to go out every 2 hours the fence breaking our hot water heater dying and flooding the basement. I guess what I am saying is life is getting real lifey and I am not sure if I am doing my LO any developmental favors by letting all of this get in the way of tummy time and trying to get him to stay awake more during the day. I wanted to make sure he had the immunization benefits until he had a bulk of his vaccines done. But am I killing myself to make this happen? Is the juice worth the squeeze and if so how much longer till he is covered? We have a hard time latching but I am contemplating getting set up with a supplemental nursing system ahead of his two month checkup because his RSV vaccine hit him so hard his entire eating schedule got demolished and latching helped both of us feel better. I have heard that it also helps increase supply. Am I just chasing my own tail trying to make this happen?
3402,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I mentioned Sundays above that I had shingles on my early 20s. I was scheduled to travel in December so I Am November I went and hit a bunch of vaccines I had not had yet  mmm my first dose of because shingrix. I thought having 5 vaccines at once I should expect either pop as in the injection site or several days feeling low but neither happened to me.
3403,What is going on with my face: Absolutely. First time it happened I was told shingles even though i had zero other signs of shingles besides the numbness. I am awaiting a CT scan I am just looking to see if anyone else has experienced these same symptoms
3406,"Significant pain after several immunizations: I received several vaccines yesterday and my arms are still in so much pain. I had my tetanus and Flu shots previously this year and while those were sore it was nothing like this. I also have had a pretty bad headache but not sure if it's related? Would this be because I got so many at once? I had never had more two are one time before. The ones I received were trumenba, gardasil, twinrix, menectra, and varicella. Not sure if I should call my doctor or if this is common."
3407,41 and got Shingles: Got mine at 45 was unpleasantly surprised.
3412,Shingles vaccine experience: Good for you Having had both shingles prevaccine eligibility and the vaccine Ill take the 23 days of vaccine reaction every day and twice on Sunday.
3416,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Watched my FIL suffer massively from nerve damage related to shingles. Ill take 2 or 3 days of feeling bad a couple of times over what I witnessed him go through.
3417,29F 162cm 60kg. Nonsmoker. I have Rheumatoid arthritis On Pyralin Methotrexate 10mg weekly and Humira 40mg fortnightly. 6 COVID vaccines last one a week ago. Had COVID in May 2022. Exposed to covid on Monday with my mum via 20min car ride windows down. She tested positive two mornings ago. I tested yesterday before work no symptoms as a precaution as i work at a school. Checked after 20 mins and faint positive line see here 30 mins later did another rapid test negative. A few hours later I did another rapid test and it was negative. Made a GP appointment got referred for a PCR and script for antivirals. Did the PCR at 230pm results at 2am came back as NEGATIVE for both COVID and RSV. Took the first dosage of Paxlovid last night around 730pm. Generally unsymptomatic slightly headachey but have been since I got my vaccine anyway. Slight cough that comes with change from summer to winter a bit postnasal drip for the last few weeks tension headache from my vaccine aftermath. What would you tell your patient? Likely or unlikely that I have COVID ? I generally trust PCRs more than RATs. Do I take my antivirals or not? What a mind fuck
3419,"After getting the HPV vaccine, my sister has been experiencing extreme fatigue and nausea. She's had to miss work and is struggling to find relief. Has anyone else faced these side effects from the HPV vaccine? Any tips on how to manage these symptoms would be incredibly helpful. Thank you for any support."
3422,I wanted to share some updated information regarding diagnoses since I know many of you struggles. Is it really pudendal neuralgia PN? The symptoms can vary widely from person to person and it can be very stressful. I had my own doubts about my diagnosis. After several consultations with various healthcare professionals I was diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia. My symptoms included severe pain ranging from 4 to 78 which felt like stabs electric shocks and raw skin sensations. However this pain was not worsened by sitting which is common with pudendal neuralgia and it also woke me up at night which is unusual since the pain typically eases when lying down. Despite these indicators suggesting it might not be pudendal neuralgia and without additional tests everyone assumed it was. That is until I underwent an admittedly awful test called an electromyogram. This involved placing electrodes which are actually fine needles around the clitoris and the muscles of the sphincter including the anus. Yes it was painful but the test showed that my pudendal nerve was intact. However the test also revealed a neurological issue not with the pudendal nerve but rather the sacral nerve indicating a type of shingles. I had sacral shingles without an initial rash. Later blisters did appear. I first thought it was herpes but it was indeed a zona as my pain really calm down once I started the treatment. Unfortunately I still experience what is known as postherpetic neuralgia which are residual pains because the nerve remains damaged. These pains can last for years but they are nothing compared to the peak of the crisis. They range between 2 and 4 at their worst unlike the unbearable pain spikes of 8. I want to clarify that this information is not necessarily to give you hope or to invalidate your diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia but rather to provide another potential avenue to explore. I know its very complicated and some healthcare professionals might not always consider it. Examining this possibility which is relatively easier to treat compared to pudendal neuralgia could be beneficial
3424,I may have had my shingles vaccine too early after treatment.: I did not think the shingles vaccine was that bad. It is in two doses 60 days apart. It did not seem worse than a flu vaccine The rash is nasty and awful if you get that. I got it shingles even though I WAS vaccinated. I had just started BVNivo treatment so I must have been supervulnerble to it.
3425,First time shingles: Ugh so sorry you had to deal with all that. The pain part is rough. Lyrica plus topical lidocaine has helped me a lot. Also please tell me you saw an ophthalmologist. I have permanent vision loss due to shingles damage to my cornea. Feel free to yell here any time
3427,Just had my first Shingrix GSK shot today. You should too because when you get PNH it is a real pain.
3429,What are your experiences with vaccines?: Talk to your MCAS doctor about it but in most cases people with spinal leaks and MCAS both really should be getting their vaccines. I have confirmed spinal leaks and MCAS. I always get vaccinated and get my COVID vaccines on a more frequent schedule every 6 months because I am for a number of reasons in addition to MCAS and my leak at a higher risk of serious illness from the diseases I am being vaccinated for. I did not realize until I started getting COVID vaccines that adults are supposed to have other vaccines as well in addition to the annual influenza lol so since I started getting COVID vaccines I also started getting one additional vaccine at the same time as my COVID shots i.e. Tdap shingles Meningococcal and Hep B. I used to ask for one vaccine in each arm and sometimes they feel it is important to do that so that if you have a local reaction they know which vaccine caused it but when I can I prefer to get both in one arm. That way I can still use my right hand and sleep comfortably on my side. All of my COVID vaccines so far have been mRNA vaccines Pfizer and Moderna but I plan to get the vaccine next month just in time for good holiday coverage because it targets a more recent variant JN.1 than the most recent mRNA vaccines do. Definitely check in with whoever treats your MCAS though because sometimes they recommend premedication or they want us to treat side effects in a certain way. And they can let you know if they have a preferred schedule of vaccination for you.
3430,Response when asked if HPV vaccine should be taken.: Exactly. Men can carry HPV strains that because cervical cancer in women but are asymptomatic to men. I had a scare cleared it thank god even though I had gotten Gardasil as a teen and had no partners until my husband. I did everything right as they say but because my husband had previous partners and did not get vaccinated it became my problem yet did not affect him. It was not a great time and I would not wish that anxiety and stress on anyone. It did because some resentment I had to work through. I am fortunate to have cleared it but that is not the case for a lot of folks. Also it seems like some people assume HPV  cervical cancer and think it is just a risk for women. Men can get cancers from HPV too. Everyone that can should get vaccinated.
3436,Should I 21F be worried?: Did you have a combined pap with HPV combo ? If you have access to the results then try pulling them up. This should be possible if labcorp ran the test. It will tell you if HPV was performed or not. I had LSIL and HPV at 26. But it went away on its own. I tested negative for HPV up until 34 my current age. I also had the vaccine original gardasil as a teen. I plan to begin gardasil 9 tomorrow. Both versions can prevent infection from some of the 14 strains but not all of them. While it can also prevent infection it does not mean you will not ever get them. It just helps lower the chances. Overall there are things you can do to help your immune system fight. They usually do not want people under 30 to worry because your immune system is likely strong at your age. Even so. There is still the anxiety and fear which is valid. Dm me if you want and we can talk it through. Or respond here. Either way. You are not alone.
3440,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles starting at my backbone and following a rib ending at my sternum it felt like there was a brass barbecue cleaning brush scraping my nerves really hard indescribably painful glad I caught it early
3445,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: Niece got it a little older than your daughter. Went totally off the rails with mental health. Self harm. suicide attempts. The whole nine yards. Is this something that just happens to teenage girls or does a medication with a huge dose of neurotoxins help that along also?
3446,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: I just got back from a four hour round trip to get my daughter her covid shot now that she is old enough my county does not have them available anywhere for under 3s. They asked if I wanted to also give her the flu shot. I said Heck yes
3447,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Um. He is wrong. The facepalm is you believing him.
3449,"I got rid of shingles in a week (smaller case): 9 days ago I a rash began to appear on my forehead and 3 days after the pain started to begin and it felt like a bunch of tiny hot needles were poking at my forehead. My migraine was terrible and I started to develop a fever and it felt like Covid times 3 (from my past Covid experiences) When the bumps started getting bigger and the pain continued, I went to the doctor who told me I had shingles and prescribed me both Doxycycline (more so for acne) and Valacyclovir to help speed up the recovery process. I only washed my face with lukewarm water and gently cleaned the parts of my face not effected by the shingles then would clean the shingles section very gently. I noticed after my showers the itchiness was much more aggressive so my mother told me to put aloe Vera on it. I hesitated since I read that you should allow it to try out rather than hydrate it but the aloe Vera first gives it a hydrating feeling then dries it out. I did this every morning and night after rinsing the effected section with lukewarm water. The aloe Vera did wonders for my shingles, both in taking away itchiness and in bringing down my bumps and helping with the scarring faze. Now after 10 days the scar is barely noticeable and I've began using a very gentle non-sunscreen lotion to hydrate that area. I've still been avoiding the sun as much as possible but the amount of progress my shingles has made in such a short period of time is incredible, as I read it usually lasts 2-4+ weeks."
3450,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had the shingles Jan 2023 I was 35 and it was the most traumatizing thing I Have experienced. I have CKD so I had a bad reaction to the antivirals I was given. Since my kidneys do not work properly the antivirals built up in my system and I went into an altered mental state which landed me in the hospital. I finished the regime at a lower dose under the supervision of doctors but at some point I thought I was schizophrenic. It was crazy. I obsessively documented my rash since I first spotted it was so bad that I looked like a burn victim. Most scars have faded but I still have a huge one down my neck. I do not wish shingles on anyone but I hope anyone who gets it has a smooth recovery.
3452,HPV vaccine og mundhulekrft: Jeg fik vaccinen og jeg er autist i dag brormand
3456,Because of shingles other than stress?: I do not really know if there is a connection but my last bout of shingles came on about 12 weeks after my husband had Covid in JulyAugust. I never got Covid even sharing home space with him but I did start feeling super run down after he was sick and broke with shingles I also have a kid in prekkindergarten and we were sick sooo much over the last year I think my immune system just bottomed out. No other big stress in life though and I was told to try and reduce my stress lol
3458,Has anyone under 60 been able to receive the RSV vaccine?: I got it but it took a year of trying and three hospital admissions and I had to tell my doctor I would be willing to pay out of pocket if insurance denied it they did not. My asthma is also significantly worse than yours sounds and I had to get it in my doctor's office.
3461,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Just wrote up above the at I got them this year at 47. It was not the worst but it was bad enough. I struggled through work without missing for the most part did pull some WFH which was pretty slack.
3462,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Thank you for getting TDAP. The whooping cough outbreaks suck for adults. I Am old had the shot as a kid and somehow ended up with no immunity. I thought Id be coughing for the rest of my life. It took about 8 months to feel normal again. I was a teacher so I was exposed to everything
3464,Shingles and other Vaccines: I do not know if this is true but I once heard that if you have a bad reaction to a vaccine it means you would have had an even worse reaction to the actual disease. As a child I got very sick from my small pox vaccination and the doctor told my parents I would probably have died if I actually got small pox. Maybe not true but I keep that in mind when I feel like crap after any vaccination. And shingles suck.
3466,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Huh. I too experienced shingles in my early 30s which my doctor at the time said was pretty rare. I only had it diagnosed when I returned home from a Japan trip and had itchy bumps around my chest where my bag was causing friction. Several days prior however I was very sick and basically stayed on a couch in Osaka unable to do much of anything but up until now I assumed those events were unrelated.
3470,Its my first time having shingles and honestly I Am quite concerned as its my 3rd day after being diagnosed by a clinic. It started out on the right side of my back at my shoulder blades but as the days pass I noticed it spreading to my armpit area and there are even few spots on my chest and arms. Will it continue to spread if so is there a timeline till it stop spreading? Will it be worse after the next few days? There Is so much on my mind right now its causing me to have anxiety as I keep overthink the situation. I was also prescribed ACYCLOVIR to help clear up the virus according to the doctor and I Have been taking it diligently but it does not seem to help the spreading
3471,I had CIN2 and I cleared the virus in 4 years. I Am 32F. I had GARDASIL 9 vaccine and I used Papilocare gels I Am from Europe for 15 years Before I tested positive for HPV 58. This is the progression 2020 ASCUS I did nothing 2021  LSIL i did nothing 2022 CIN1CIN 2 started papilocare  got the vaccine 2023  ASCUS continued papilocare 2024  nothing Have to do the next test in 3 years Wooho
3474,Shingles vaccine experience: I got the shingles vaccine a few years back with only minor aches in my arm. Yes some people have a strong reaction to a vaccine. Better than the disease.
3477,Anybody feel the spot where you had shingles flare up after the Pfizer vaccine?: It does not seem like a new case of shingles but the are probably got inflamed and causing slight discomfort where the shingles used to be.
3478,2 months vaccine . Both or one at a time?: My daughters got their two month vaccines today actually. They got two shots and the oral rotovirus vaccine. They previously received their rsv vaccine two weeks ago it is not a part of the normal two month vaccines but you could probably request it I would. I would just get both together very rarely do babies react to these vaccines and it is just better to get it out of the way rather than go back to the doctors another time. My girls are doing great and have had no reactions Good luck It stinks to see them cry after the shots but they settle quickly
3479,41 and got Shingles: My brother got it in December at 40. According to the team treating him it was one of the worst cases they have seen. He was hospitalized for quite some time and hes still not over it 7 months later. Hes a tough dude and said it was by far the worst thing hes ever experienced.
3481,Shingles vaccine: Absolutely  shingles are no fun. I had it running down my sciatic nerve in my right leg.
3483,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had chickenpox at about 7 years old in a time where parents took their kids to be infected because it was better to have it as a child. I also watched my mother have it when I was 13. She was hospitalised and I contracted shingles all at the same time as my little 1 year old brother got chickenpox. I was lucky because the rash just developed under my arm. My cousin got shingles all over his back. The only treatment back then was some sort of ear ointment. And I still have the scar. If anyone had purposely infected my babies with chickenpox when there is a vaccine available I might actually have spent time in jail. And that is coming from someone who has had the MMR vaccine 5 times and still is not immune to rubella.
3484,Zoster sine herpete Hello Since October 2023 I have been dealing with a pins and needles feeling intermittent a stiff neck and a burning pain sensation in my left shoulder C8Th1 dermatome. My brain MRI is normal so no MS my spine MRI is normal so no root compressionherniated disk. A lumbar puncture is scheduled to rule out neuroborreliosis. My neurologist thinks I had shingles and am having a postherpetic neuralgia. The problem is I never noticed having shingles. I may have noticed a few pimples on my upper back but I am 21 and have facial acne so this did not surprise me. Definitely no rash. Neuro says I can have had something called zoster sine herpete. Does this reasoning make sense? And if yes what the fuck do I do? This pain is horrible and the pins and needles are even worse its like my shoulder is asleep and someone is slightly burning it at the same time.

3486,My son aged 1 has developed a chest infection. I assume it might be from his vaccines he had last week and his immune system was not great and has developed it. But regardless we needed to go see a doctor as I suspect he may need antibiotics. Anyone in England knows how bad waiting times are at the walkin center. It is horrific. Almost 3 hours in a waiting room to see a doctor after triage. My son 1 started walking 2 months ago and ever since then you cannot get him to sit still. He wants to be on the move all the time. Seating areas are boring for kids. I needed to take him on a walk. So off we went he held my hand at time but mostly I was throwing off his balance so he walks the drunk baby walk and I am slowly 2 steps behind. We walk down corridors left and right. I was just following him I let him lead the way. On our walk we came across a woman who was also in a seating area but she has glass panels around her. I did not know why at the time. Almost like in a box but it has no doors there was a gap to walk right in and out. She sees my son walking past and she is smiling ear to ear I assume thinking how adorable he is. She says hello to him and he carries on walking. We walked past many people at the time. He stopped to look at a few and some he carried on his walking mission. We looped around and walked back and forth many times. We walk past the woman again and this time my son decides to walk in the open gap to go inside. I did not know why she was in there like that so I said is it ok that he comes in? She says in a really polite way I am isolating I said oh I am sorry and I pick him up. I then said I have just washed his hands if that is any consolation I do not know why I said this in hindsight just wanted to say we are germ free I guess. she says it is not a problem it is just that she has shingles so cannot touch him. I said oh I see. And off he went. So I said bye before rushing back to my position behind him as we walk. At one pointanother lap in our journey he came to the glass box where the lady was and he pressed his face and hands against the glass. She could probably see his squished nose from her POV. She laughed. The next lap we did she was not there. And I was quite sad if I am honest. She could not touch him but she sure did appreciate seeing him she smiled every single time. A bit later it just so happened that as I was walking down another corridor with my son again the same lady was walking out of a consultation room with a doctor. She was headed towards the exit. I saw her as she was leaving and almost like that 6th sense thing it was like she knew I was looking at her from behind. She turned around and looked straight at us. She smiled and waved. I smiled and waved back.
3487,It is my understanding that if you do not get the vaccine you can get them again. My husband got shingles last June. The face and head kind. He was sick for 3 months and he still has problems. The problems may never go away.
3493,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Thought I was going to be the old guy '80 here. Got chickenpox at age 5 still have noticable scars on my chest and arms. Get questions on them every couple of years. Got it from some kid in my kindergarten class. Had shingles on in? my left arm about 2 years ago. Hurt like dammit. Thought I was having a heart attack it hurt so bad went to the doctor and was told it was shingles. Very little rash on the skin just some mild discoloration on my shoulder. Did not know until I had kids that there is a vaccine for either.
3494,RSV vaccine?: I got mine and it was totally fine. My son was born and was in the nicu for almost a year with respiratory illnesses and consequences of those illnesses led him to be trached and vented to this day. I am not playing with viruses.
3499,Shingles vaccine: I got both shots and the second was a little worse than the first but neither were really that bad for me. Plus I got a Covid shot at the same time but I forget if it was with the first or second shot probably first.
3501,Shingrix for 50yr olds: Dang that is terrible. regular exercise helped my nerve issues when healing. Are you taking antivirals? The antiviral gave me excruciating migraines eye pain. sensitivity to light as soon as I stopped the medicine that went away
3502,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My 87 year old dad got shingles about 6 months after my mom died. At first he thought he was having a heart attack because the pain in his back was unbearable. I think the stress of my mom's illness and death brought it on it was a bad year. Anyway he is vaccinated now and tells anyone over 50 to get it and get it soon. Do not delay. Shingles sucks.
3505,"Have you received your flu shot? Just got mine and had a pretty intense reaction. My arm is so sore, but I know it's worth it to protect myself from the flu this season."
3506,To pregnant woman in NL ask about RSV vaccination: Hi I am a pharmacist. My wife got it a few months ago. The excipients in the vaccine are very basic and not generally considered harmful. The clinical studies are also very successful. Our baby is fine. I recommend you do your own research as the information is public. You can also feed it to chat got to break it down to you.
3507,Shingrex Vaccine: I guarantee you will not get a straight answer. I think in the UK Bells is listed as a possible side effect to the COVID vaccine. I developed a chronic hive condition about 3 months after Bells. I asked the allergist if the 2 could be connected. He could not say for sure but he did say that since COVID we have learned that viruses do some crazy stuff in the body.
3510,"Looking for insights: After receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine a couple of months ago, I (25/M) started experiencing a sharp pain in my chest that comes and goes. My doctor suspects it could be a case of shingles without the typical rash. The idea that a vaccine could potentially lead to shingles has left me feeling confused and hesitant about pursuing any further vaccinations. I value the importance of protecting myself and others from Covid-19, but this unexpected side effect has given me pause. I'm eager to hear if anyone else has encountered similar symptoms after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. Your experiences and advice would be greatly appreciated."
3514,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got it when I was 17. It was the summer between my junior and senior year. I spent most of that summer doped up on painkillers. The spot where I was infected on my back is mostly dead to the touch. Every once in a while I still get a sharp pain in that spot.
3515,First Time w Shingles really struggling: That Is awfully painful try to stay out of the wind because that makes it worse. Hope you are much better soon. I know how bad it can be as I had it down my entire left side of my face I soon learnt to stay away from any sort of breeze. Take care.
3516,Shingles vaccine experience: well done i have had clients with shingles on their face and torsoabsolutely excruciating in their words. got my vaccine at 50 and happy to have evaded it. i do not recall having a terrible second shot just arm soreness and some mild fatigue. considering reupping my pertussis vaccine as that is now spreading like crazy in my area
3519,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: My 8 month old was vaccinated a few weeks ago and my doctor said that the antibodies in the vaccine would start working right away  its not like the flu vaccine where immunity has to build up. So it might be worth asking if it would be beneficial for him to be vaccinated while hes sick to give him an antibody boost. But I totally agree that the communication and roll out of the vaccine has been horrible.
3521,Shingles vaccine second dose: My second dose was much worse than the first but then again I got COVID right after so there is that wearyface
3526,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: The nerve sensitivity and down right pain is still in my scalp after getting shingles 8 months ago. I hope the day is fast arriving when I will not need the gabapentin but right now its still needed. I Am 73 and work full time get the vaccine
3529,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Caught it at 22yo and it was brutal. Get vaccinated kiddos
3530,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles at 25. Fortunately it was just mild but it was awful nonetheless.
3531,Got menopause? You may be due for your shingles vaccine: I know that my family doctor had said that he could try to get an exemption or something from the health insurance because I have MS and it is auto immune  but he sounded a little unsure as to whether they would go for it so I did not try. Looking back I sure wish I had. The shot could be very expensive it is 2 6 months apart. It is crazy how it sounds like SO much money but then you experience the issue in this case Shingles and wish you would just paid the damn money. My mother had shingles about 17 years ago but she got it on her face and is now blind in one eye. She did get it in her early 60s so I thought I had enough time to wait till my 50s to get vaccinated but got shingles at 47 . I did not get it in my face and I do not suffer much now  but that first three weeks was absolute hell and the three weeks after we pretty hard too . I still get some twinges a year or two later but mostly it is gone. I do live in fear of a reoccurrence. I am almost 50 now and will probably get the first shot right after my birthday.
3533,RSV vaccine?: My boy got it yesterday Every baby reacts differently but it made my guy super sleepy so get the shot and get home quick so you can also enjoy a nap while he sleeps like we did
3535,Old lady in the pharmacy last time I was there complaining that the shingles vaccine gave her shingles and all the covid boosters put her in bed for a month. But SHE STILL PLANNED TO TAKE THE NEXT ONE. I just... I do not understand.
3539,New flu vaccine methods show promise against H5N1 bird flu  DW  12192024: more that your immune system encountered something novel so it was all WT cussword?? some people do react more to one vaccine than the other. Moderna at least a first had more antigen active ingredient than the pfizer so that is most likely why many had more side effects. I usually get the moderna because they did use a higher dose giving more protection. I would rather feel like crap for a day or two than be out of operation for weeks if I got the actual illness. I am already disabled and find it hard to do physical basics. by the way i am usually wiped by a basic seasonal flu yet tdap onlyy makes my arm sore the last time shrug. shingles was a kicker but much better than the agony of shingles as reported by people i know who have had shingles.
3542,My 91 yo mum developed shingles almost three weeks ago and has not eaten since. She Is unlikely to pull through. Get the shingles vaccine. shingrix
3544,Shingles vaccine at 27?: Id get it if I were you I got shingles at 20 on my scalp it was a nightmare
3546,Got mine two weeks ago sore arm for a few days. Biggest pain was paying for it as too young to get free but I figured if I got shingles I would sell a kidney to get rid of it.
3548,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: geez that is scary. glad you went in. I feel like I got lucky mine were just on my mid and upper trapezius area and it crept pretty slowly. I thought it was some kind of heat rash at first and when I went in it was more just a due diligence thing because clearly something was going on. I appreciate that my dr did not wait for swab results before she offered me the pills. still took a week or two to clear but it did stop the spread. I did not fully appreciate how serious shingles can be until I started to hear the stories.
3554,I can say the Shingles vaccine can make you feel flu like symptoms for a day. I can also say having Shingles hurt so bad I made my wife take me to the Emergency Room. I could have lost vision in my left eye. If you are 50 get the damn shot on a Friday and take the weekend off.
3555,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I have not had pneumonia shot yet but Shingles was not too bad. Mainly nausea and fatigue.
3559,I Have had it twice also. I was in so much pain for 3 weeks the 1st time I got it. Second time was not OTT pain for about a week. Then I had some pain another time but no rash so not sure if that was shingles again. I keep saying I should get the vaccine but have not done it yet
3565,MILs work has a RSV outbreak do we still go for Christmas ?: I would not go. RSV is no joke despite some people acting like its not a big deal. Many kiddos end up in the hospital hence your MIL dealing with an outbreak. There will be other christmases where your kiddo is older and better able to handle a potential infection. Maybe your pediatrician would be able to get your daughter the RSV shot though? My daughter 2 had the shot and caught RSV last week and it was very mild largely in part to having those existing antibodies already I think.
3568,Put me out of my misery.: I got shingles on my face right now I went to urgent care yesterday and yep its shingles. It is very painful and looks disgusting. I am definitely getting the vaccine so this does not happen again.
3569,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I thought my shingles was something really wrong with my kidney. I went to urgent care but they said all kidneyurine stuff seemed fine. Two days later the rash appeared and eventually moved in a line from my back to my belly button. Your wife should not get the vaccine for at least six months. I think that is what my doctor said. She will have plenty of natural immunity until then.
3570,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Yup. My younger brother had it and it was awful I turn 50 in March and I have already set up my doctor's appointment for my birthday.
3571,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had shingles in my late 20s. Take my word I would not complain about being tired or sore for a couple days. I had shingles reoccurring for a year. Nerve pain and itching from shingles lasts YEARS. You can also have permanent scaring from the lesions. You Are almost guaranteed to get a reoccurrence of shingles if you have had chickenpox. And most of us had chickenpox parties when we were kids.
3574,Shingles and other Vaccines: Thank you kind person. I Am feeling way better today after three days of all kinds of body weirdness
3575,Shingles vaccine experience: I had a neighbor years ago who was in his mid 80s. He had a terrible case of shingles with horrible sores on his back and horrendous pain. When the original vaccine came out I jumped all over it. I NEVER want to experience what my poor neighbor went through. When the improved Shingrix vaccine came out I jumped all over it The second dose did because a couple of days of arm discomfort but Id take a lifetime of that arm discomfort over full blown shingles Just do it.
3578,If you had this reaction to the teeny vaccine dose can you imagine if you did get shingles without the vaccine??
3582,2 Broken ribs plus shingles equals ouch: I do not have suggestions. Just sending air hugs. I have broken 3 ribs at once with some torn muscles and ligaments guessing you have those as well and I have had shingles but it was not at the same time. I cannot imagine how you feel with all of it at once. From experience it will get better but it is going to take time. So sorry that you are in this situation. I wish you the best.
3588,Dear fucktard obviously you do not read like all the other fucktards on this thread. She got the Covid vaccine which is known to because shingles as a side effect. Slow down and read. Or if you are determined to poison yourself with another vaccine I guess no one can stop you.
3594,"Pfizer vaccine, side effects from second dose: How did you react to the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine? Took my second shot yesterday, and initially, I just had a sore arm. But in the middle of the night, I woke up drenched in sweat with a pounding headache and muscle aches all over. The fever spiked, and I felt like I was hit by a truck. Took some painkillers and managed to get some rest. Today, the fever has subsided, but I still feel exhausted and a bit dizzy. Hoping these side effects don't linger for too long. Anyone else had a rough time with the Pfizer second dose? ???? ---"
3596,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles when I was 25 and it was fucking hell. I got the symptoms for awhile before the rash even started. As a result that confused doctors because it was the symptoms without the rash so they initially did not know how to help or thought it was psychological. Which prolonged the treatment. I was disabled from it for awhile because the pain is immense and even moving was excruciating. I hope I never get it again.
3597,Shingles vaccine experience: Had shingles on my lower back and the pain was excruciating. When I turned 65 I got the vaccine free at 65 and have never experienced side effects or shingles again. So worth it
3601,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles in my mid 20s on my face. Thankfully I caught it early but was still super painful. The nerve pain even after my skin healed would stop me in my tracks
3602,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: I have not had the shingles shot yet however about 10 years ago I had my spleen removed and prior to that it was required that I have a Flu Pneumonia and Meningitis shot. I walked out of that office with 2 sore arms and a sore butt cheek. Could Not do much for a few days after.
3603,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born 81 was sent next door to wish the neighbor kid 'get well soon.' My mother made sure that we hugged him and about a day later I was itchy and covered in sores. My oldest child born in 00 went for his vaccinations and they asked if I wanted to give him the chicken pox vaccine. Yes absolutely no kid needs to go through having chicken pox. It was awful.
3605,Shingles vaccine: I did not get the full blown rash but it was painful. I went to a concert got sick and then got shingles. In the ER twice in 24 hours.
3607,Shingles shot?: You do not want shingles. I have had it twice and it was super unpleasant both times.
3611,"Just got my second dose of the shingles vaccine and let me tell you, it's kicking my butt! The side effects are no joke - fever, chills, body aches, you name it. But hey, I'd take a few rough days over getting shingles any day. Stay strong, fellow vaccine warriors!"
3612,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I am living it right now. I have been trying to find an immunosuppressant that works for me and I woke up Friday with shingles all over my face and scalp. At first I thought it was bug bites. Then I thought hives so I got an antihistamine. I went to my rheumatologist today and they put me on antivirals and painkillers and I was lucky to get an appt at an opthalmologist right after to make sure my eye is ok. The worst part is i have a 7mo old who cannot take the chickenpox vaccine yet and I cannot hold him without a huge risk of him getting chicken pox. Plus I work in sales and no one is buying from someone with open wounds on their face.
3615,23F. Currently dealing with ringworm on my hip however am on oral antifungals for that for 2 weeks and this appeared just a few days ago. Itchy when I run against it but I do not notice it otherwise. My boyfriend just had shingles so I have been on the lookout for chickenpox could it look like this? I was vaccinated against it and had my latest booster at 17. Never had chickenpox. Kind Of stuck at what this could be only affecting my left side. Not sure if this is related but I also have issues with body numbnesstingling and pain on the left side of my body too which has been going on for a few months now. History of leukaemia 20042007 undiagnosed upper body rash 20192020 ringworm that comes back every few months 2020present scarlet fever tonsillitis in April 2024. I also have IBS.
3620,New RSV mRNA trial recruiting babies for investigational vaccines: No fooking way. My best friends 2 year old healthy baby dies 24 hours after jab . Died in her grandpas arms on way to hospital. No
3621,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Like other people have said from what I understand its antibodies not a vaccine. Both my girls got the shot before they left the NICU they are thriving. I Am happy they have some protection against RSV. The ER where I live is full of RSV and flu cases.
3622,Shingles vaccine: My insurance would not pay for the vaccine because I am under 50 years old. But at an increased risk due to being immunosuppressed due to meds. Unfortunately I did get shingles and then insurance gave approval for me to get the vaccines. I did get ill from the first vaccine but not from the second. Speaking from personal experience the ill effects of the vaccine were nothing compared to the pain from actual shingles. Good luck .
3623,It is auto immune shingles as a result of you are BS vaccine you fkers
3624,Information female age 21 take vyvanse for ADHD but no other medications. I developed 4 painful blisters near my eye which caused a lot of inflammation as well. I went to the doctor and she tested for herpes and a spider bite I live in Australia lol. She assumed it was herpes simplex but it came back as herpes zoster. I thought shingles came up on the back and you would have more than one shingle. I Have never had chickenpox but been vaccinated against it as a child I believe? The doctor said it could have been a false positive or something and says it could still be herpes simplex. I have never had any other symptoms of herpes no cold sores anywhere.
3625,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Hey shingles is no joke. I got it on october 5 2023 and I was born in 1986. It was on my left arm. My left hand was swollen. I could not close my tumb and forefinger together. Random shots of pain cursing thru pain scale 610. Little bumps freak me out now.
3626,Shingles Vaccine worsened symptoms: I no longer get any vaccine vaccines. Had too many crap reactions to too many different ones and not all bowel related. Never again
3632,"Seeking advice from the community: I (40/F) recently got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and have been experiencing some unusual symptoms. About a week after my shot, I developed a persistent burning sensation on my scalp, which my doctor thinks could be a sign of shingles. I never imagined that a vaccine could potentially lead to shingles, but the more I research, the more I see the connections. It's concerning to think that something meant to protect me could have triggered this condition. While I am grateful for the protection the vaccine offers against Covid-19, I can't help but feel hesitant about receiving any additional doses. Has anyone else encountered a similar situation after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?"
3633,41 and got Shingles: Yes and mine was pretty mild that being said it was still very uncomfortable and Id highly recommend anyone that can get the vaccine to get it.
3636,I had very painful shingles.. The vaccine shot was a breeze compared to shingles.
3637,Directly lead to me getting Shingles
3638,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I got shingles when I was 39. It started in my earspread up the back of my neck and hairline. My daughter was 8 and my husband was deployed. It was misdiagnosed and I went back the next day and then they told me what it was. I had an awful case of chickenpox when I was in 2nd grade and missed almost 6 weeks of school. For the shingles they gave me oxycodone for the pain. That Is how I found out I was allergic. My tongue swelled upmy heart was racing and I could not move to get my phone to call 911. Stay home and avoid people as much as possible. Hope you feel better soon. I would not wish them on anyone.
3639,We were discharged from nicu on November 4 after baby was born at 32 and 0. I had to stay 247 the last wk of our month long stay because my kids were sick and I did not want to risk not being able to visit the nicu. Then our older son got a cold in mid November and we separated the baby on different floor and he never got it. Fast forward to this wk  we had to separate baby again for 7 days because my son and daughter were sick . But baby still got it. turns out it was RSV. Hes now being admitted to the Childrens hospital despite getting the rsv vaccine in the nicu. The nurse did say it could have been even worse if he did not have it. Hes on hfnc and they are starting an antibiotic because its unclear whether he has pneumonia. I Am just sad. For my poor baby my other kids who were finally getting to feel like mommy was here to stay and for myself and my husband who are so tired of having our family be separated and our toddlers not truly understanding why. Any one have a similar hospitalization? Would love to hear your experiencescourses.
3640,: How to not let myself be terrified of this I do not know. I did not get the vaccine but my parents did and my mum had a mini heart attack last month. What the hell can we do if anything to stop and or reverse any of this ? cryingface
3641,I do not want to discourage anyone from fasting I love it. But some studies show it can temporarily weaken your immune system during fasting. During one of my first fasts I had a breakout of shingles at 23 yo and I had no idea what it was. So if you develop an ouchy rash just be aware shingles lives inside many of us waiting for a time to break out. And you will want to take care of it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Just want to post incase it may help someone avoid potential lifelong owies.
3645,Update from my orginal post on the day I was diagnosed with GW: Yes it is the vaccine. Though i have a wart it is not a cure for them its mainly for the strains that has a potential to because cancerit does not happen often with high risk strains but might as well protect yourself anyway some say taking the vaccine actually helped them get rid of the warts faster. Not sure if its coincidence or not but i got the first shot the day i got diagnosed and my wart has significantly decreased in size along with me using Imiquimodaldara so id think the vaccine helped my body recognize the warts better. Honestly i am not too sure. I guess it is through my insurance. My provider said if you have insurance they cover the 3 shots up until I think age 26. I am not sure where you live but in my state that is what she told me but if you do not there should be programs to help lessen the price of the shot. I would first talk to the pharmacy and see what they recommend as your next step.
3659,I can so relate. Never had any issues with any vaccines till Shingrix. Id compare it to getting hit by a freight train
3660,Rinvoqacneshingles: i got shingles one month after starting Remsima a year and a half ago. it was like helllll. my doctor did not mention anything about a shingles vaccine prior though.
3661,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: I got my second shot about a month ago and have not noticed an increase.
3665,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Did Not hurt my arm much at all. But headachenausea was tough
3669,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Hope she is ok and gets some help
3671,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I developed shingles as an adult and it was horrendous. I still have nerve damage from it. The fact that this is now avoidable which I did not know really boils my parsnips.
3673,Shingles invited itself to my travel: It was so Incredibly painful. It look like a golf ball was under my eye lid. I could do nothing. It lay down in dark room. Try not to move. My ophthalmologist gave me great drugs for the pain. Thankfully I ve been vaccinated now and that should be a thing of past. Twice is two times to many
3675,"Living the life we have to live... sucks: Great advice, I'd also add that the best time for any vaccine type shots is about four months after each infusion. So I had my last infusion in October, I'm going to get any shots I might need in February. I think it has to do with the B cells starting to come back."
3678,Fever and stiffness?: Oh wow that sounds rough. I Have definitely been nauseous but the fever was low and has gone away now. The stiffness mostly resolved too so I think the shingles just hit me weird for a few days.
3679,reading this tweet with a fresh bandaid on my arm from my RSV vaccine and Prozac absolutely coursing through my veins
3680,mRNA future: Been three years since i got the pfizer covid shots. Did Not feel any side effects but after being informed about mrna months later when people were dying i have been scared sometimes about the same happening to me. Did Not get any boosters or flu shots. Done with all shots
3682,Shingles vaccine: Its like two days of discomfort after each of two shots feeling crappy but totally fine to get stuff done. The alternativegetting shinglesis horrible based on family and friends who went through it. Get the vaccine.
3689,Oh no I had the Shingles before very painful . Just got my Shingles shot three weeks ago. Prayers for a fast recovery
3693,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My kid got the vaccine at 2 days old and had no problems with it.
3698,Under 35 with Shingles?: 43 and got it for the first time in Nov during a period of high stress. A month and a half later I got an intense massage in the hopes of relieving the pain in that area and the next day my shingles came back
3702,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: Sending love your way. I understand the frustration. Hope you start getting better. There are treatments that help. Does Not help everyone but I have found my version of help
3703,Ontario expands RSV vaccinations: Funny how they do not tell you the kids who developed respiratory issues after receiving this vaccine.
3704,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Oh you sweet thing. I had it like that on my forehead and into my scalp. It was a ninth off work. Gappabentin worked good but I was not drowsy with it either. Prednisone will help you too. I Am still dealing with my scalp and just give yourself permission to check out of your routine life right now really. Do Not fight it. You Will get back on track but surrender to the shingle thing for now get some prednisone and I took pain killers like crazy. I needed them and I was not sorry for that decision. I Am praying for you really I am.
3706,My mom recently got this sort of itchy rash on the inside of her upper arm and she seems to be getting some little flare ups on her opposite hand and arm. Not sure what it is and she is never had this before and she does not have any allergies. she is in her early 60 s and has her shingles shot shots.
3708,I tell everyone the vaccine is rough but worth it. I Have never been in as much pain as I was when I had Shingles. I Have had a kidney transplant and that was nothing whereas Shingles actually had me doubled over in pain.
3712,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I got shingles early when I was in the 2nd grade back in the 80 s. It appeared on my stomach. I do not remember this but my mom told me that the pain was so bad that I would smash my head against the wall almost to the point of knocking myself out. I had a mild case of it again in my early 20 s. I am pretty sure I cannot get the vaccine but I strongly suggest getting it if any of you can. Hang in there.
3715,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: I think my husband said he got a headache that lasted the day but that was about it.
3716,given my mother took a shingles vaccine to not infect our stepdad and it gave us all shingles i had it at 17 flatlined stepdad 3x had self and sis down for 10 days and could have caused anything from heart damage to encephalitis. from a vaccine she did not need. got herpes cure in me
3720,I pray it does not reactivate EBV in you as it did me 3 years ago. I would do anything to live a day where I feel normal. The vaccine has made it so I cannot get the shingles shot because my body is now attacking itself and that would fuel the fire. It may be good for you. But
3728,Shingles vaccine: Had a light case a few years ago that started on top of my head and was working down my forehead towards my eye. That was a truly horrendous experience I would not wish on anyone.
3730,I actually think its going to turn out to be from the vaccine acute shingles aka internal shingles. covidinjury
3732,I 25 F noticed a rash on my back got it confirmed at doctors office that it is Shingles. After diagnosed I thought I d read up on Shingles. I wish I knew about this when I was diagnosed 2 years ago because UC is an autoimmune disorder you SHOULD get the shingles vaccine to prevent this horrible experience I am going through. A UC flare is absolutely worse but this still isn t fun. My doctor made me aware that I should get the flu shot every year but didn t mention shingles. I hope this helps someone to prevent this happening to them. Goodluck out there colitis kids. We re all root in for each other. link with UC and shingles different UC with shingles study
3734,First time shingles and scared: ? bro this is my back
3736,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I would take shingles alone. Kicked my butt for 2 days. Dreading 2nd one but its still better than having shingles.
3738,About 3 weeks ago I went to doctor for a rash on my left side. I was told it was folliculitis. Got some antibiotics and steroids and off I went. 2 weeks later Still had a rash and the intense pain in my back started. It started radiating down my leg all the way to my toes. Its tender to the touch and totally numb. Pain got so intense I went to ER and was LOOKED at no tests or anything and Dr said I have sciatica. He said the rash was insignificant and it was sciatica causing the pain. Told there is no treatment. Another week of insane pain and a trip to my oncologist for a cancer check up and he says hey you have shingles. Now I Am waiting for a visit with my PCP Thursday to get a 4th opinion. So its been almost 2 months since it started. No real major rash but there are a few spots where it is. Its more PAIN than anything. The last month I have not really left the house or even my bed for that matter its so painfull. So what am I taking Valcyclovere gabapentin acetaminophen oxycodone prednisone and the actual only thing helping with the pain is THC edibles. About 125 mg of thc and it dulls the pain to a lower grade. Still hurts but I can move around at least. 30 days of intense pain has started to make me kind of fucking insane in the membrane I Am ready to be struck by lightning
3743,I Am a 64 year old female. About six weeks ago I broke out in shingles on my chest and back on my left side. I had been having sharp pains internally in exact areas of breakouts. I went to my doctor and she put me on an antiviral and so shingles healed in about 10 days with little discomfort. Once off the antiviral I developed a respiratory infection which quickly turned into serious pneumonia. I went to the ER and they sent me home on two antibiotics. I have never been sicker in my life. I was honestly worried I might die. After a week of antibiotics I was not getting better. I went to my doctor but before I left home I noticed I was breaking out in shingles on the opposite side of my body but also on my chest and back. She sent me to ER so they could admit me to the hospital. Thank goodness I broke out in shingles because that is how they figured out what was going on. Once in the hospital they took me off antibiotics and started intravenous antiviral drug. I started getting better the first day. Shingles went away quickly. I was in the hospital two days and they sent me home with a week of antiviral meds. After that week a chest xray showed the pneumonia was gone. I am still recovering from horrible fatigue and still coughing up phlegm from my lungs which is something I could not do until recently. My diagnosis was Varicella pneumonia which is pneumonia caused by the shingles virus. Apparently it has a pretty significant mortality rate. I was lucky. I plan to get the shingles vaccine once I Am totally recovered.
3745,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I Have had it I went to the dr and paid they gave some cream and antibiotic. I had flu like symptoms forever. Its not that big of a deal.
3748,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I did Pneumonia by itself and it made me feel like crap for a couple days. I have never done shingles but I have hear they are pretty rough. I would suggest timing your shots before a weekend or whatever days you have off and getting one then the other one.
3751,RSV vaccine for infants.: Most likely your doctor is talking about Beyfortus which is not technically a vaccine its a dose of antibodies. For that reason the protection will last only roughly five months. But that is more than enough to last through the rest of RSV season similar to flu season. I got it for my baby as soon as I could RSV is really dangerous for little babies so wanted to feel more comfortable having her around people. That was several months ago now.
3753,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Interesting. One slight correction the vaccine was approvedlicensed for US use in 95 but was used internationally beforehand. I am 29F and just got over a round of shingles. I was born in 95 had the vaccine in 96 allegedly had two round of chicken pox in the early 2000s. I remember being sick with them but I wonder now if it was actually shingles and not varicella since I was vaccinated. I did not know that it was possible to get shingles at 29. I was informed that the biggest red flag is pain at the site before the rash appears. I noticed pain for two days before the singles rash showed up. Also take your antivirals I did not take them quickly enough and the rash spread.
3755,Shingles vaccine?: Get the vaccine. I am 41. Got shingles 3 years ago. Most painful thing I have ever dealt with never had kids so take that as you will. I got the vaccine last year. Do it. My doses were 4 months apart. They said it should be 26 months apart so I split it in the middle.
3759,Put me out of my misery.: Same happened to me both times. That one is nasty. But better then shingles. Mother in law had it painful stuff. Not I did not which it on her. Great lady.
3760,41 and got Shingles: I had it last year at 44. It SUCKED. I only had a very mild case of it and it was incredibly painful. I cannot imagine having a severe case. It also took quite a while to go away I can still see marks where it was. Hope its not too rough for you
3762,I Am miserable its on my face: Op I Am on the tail end of week two started in my eye and affected my sinus rash did not show up till a week ago on my forehead and around the eye Now the rash is scabbing and less painful but my eye is still all messed up. Thankfully the shooting pain in my ear is finally gone Keep up the meds note that due to nerve pain regular OTC painkillers will not do much I had some relief from ice packs Sleep as much as your able to when your able to and hope it runs its course quickly as possible Unfortunately I Have learned that each case is different in regards to how long it lasts
3763,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I had a sore arm and did not feel great the next day but that was much less than when I had shingles many years ago and from what I have read I had a minor case.
3767,Shingles: Thank you for sharing your experience. I am sorry you suffer so often from this. Its insanely painful Can your physician administer the vaccine to you? It seems unreasonable for a pharmacy to refuse you with a script. So frustrating. I am glad to hear the med has not triggered a flare for you. I am quite torn right now on whether or not to continue it. I may wait to fully heal including the internal symptoms and then give it another try. Then again I may never touch it again. This has been far worse than the weight I hoped to lose. I am not obese. I just cannot seem to lose the weight I have gained over the last few years. It just may not be worth it to role the dice again if there is a connection.
3769,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: No increase in tinnitus after my shingles shot. I have had ringing ears since I was small. I was an adult before I found out it was not normal.
3770,I went in for my Covidflu on Friday but decided also to roll with pneumococcal AND shingles a quadshot if you will. Took my body on a journey to say the least. I would not recommend it better to spread out the latter two.
3771,41 and got Shingles: Right here. Had them at about 34. On my head. Felt like someone poking me with a hot icepick. Get the antiviral meds and find the stress in your life and try and eliminate it.
3772,Shingles after Shingrix: I Am under 50. I just put the money aside and went to an independent pharmacy who cut me every discount they could cut me and they cut you a lot and got it early. FYI no doctor waits until they are 50 to get their vaccination. They pay out of pocket. Interesting CVS was not willing to give it to me without a prescription but I suppose there are other pharmacies out there. I am glad doctors do not wait. Honestly I would be lining up for every vaccine I could get if I had to work in healthcare haha
3776,Shingles on my face and scalp: I had shingles on my scalp and face. I would ask your doctor to prescribe you some lidocaine cream. It helped out big time when the bumps became super itchy. Prevented me from causing scarring on my face.
3779,Hi  back in 2018 I was told that I had genital warts. About 3 of themThe dr said it was not a big deal and did not even prescribe anything. Which kind of seemed so weird to me. I used tea tree oil diluted and they went away after a month. In 2021 I had a papsmear that was normal and even received the HPV9 vaccine in 20182019 2020. I Am still unsure if GW can be fully gone. Google says usually after 2 years in women it can be gone forever but always with the disclaimer that it could remain dormant. Its stressing me out now that I am pregnant and thinking it could be dormant. Does anyone have any advice they received from their Dr on if it could really go away forever or do you just live with HPV forever. Also I Have had none since and its approaching 7 years.  also no genital warts on my cervix or inside of the vagina. Only the outside.
3780,shingles with no rash: Good for you I was in agony off and on for months. Doc and family said It was mental health. It was in my head. I needed physical therapy. It is not normal pain. Pushing out a baby is a cakewalk compared to that kind of agony. Yet it was at the high point of the pandemic so going to ER was not a really option. It was not until I stacked a massage a chiropractor and pilates appointment that the shingles finally broke through to the skin. In fact I know the exact moment during the massage that released the kraken. It was so bizarre. The pain went immediately from deep nerve antagonizing to electrical stabbing. I got on antivirals shortly thereafter. But it took months and the nerve damage is long lasting.
3781,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mom was vaccinated and still got shingles. Getting the vaccine does not guarantee you will not get shingles. Unfortunately. I am definitely not suggesting you SHOULD NOT get the vaccine though.
3782,Tysabri Infusion Shingles: I would call the neurologist. I had shingles in 2019 but did not know that is what I had. I had a few spots on my hand. I was in the ER twice in 12 hours for the pain. I went for a follow up and my dr had a physical therapist come in and they noticed the rash on my hand. My pain was in my shoulder and arm. they will get you on an antiviral so I would call the doctor.
3786,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I do not build lasting immunity to it. I had it once as a newborn then again at 5. When I went to college since I was not vaccinated I had to have my titers tested to dorm which resulted in me needing to be vaccinated. Then when I was pregnant with my oldest son they had my titers tested again and it was basically the same as college as if I had never been exposed. Both of my kids were vaccinated as soon as possible. I will eventually encourage them to have their levels tested as teensyoung adults just to make sure it is not a heritable trait. My immune system seems to be normal outside of this. I got all of the vaccines available when I was a kid and never had any of those diseases. My MMR titers came back normal during prenatal testing. My shitty superpower is just getting chickenpox I guess. Luckily I have never developed shingles.
3788,Shingles vaccine: yeah I caught CP at 26 and it is the sickest I have ever been. lumps you could see under my shirt like a pineapple. pretty sure I ended up with pneumonia as a chaser. those childhood diseases are hell on adults for some reason.
3789,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: This reminded me to ask about getting the vaccine. My wife got shingles and what she went through was awful
3790,Had my fourth with flu vaccine couple of months ago shingles about two weeks ago feeling great.
3791,Has anyone under 60 been able to receive the RSV vaccine?: 32F and I got it several weeks ago. I am however pregnant so i do not know if that makes a difference to access but if I was not I would have still asked my doctor because I have severe asthma.
3792,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I was lucky and did not have much reaction to either shot. Maybe you will be lucky with the second one. Fingers crossed for you.
3793,Shingles vaccine experience: My pain was not extreme but I had the selfinflicted experience of getting the first waiting a few years getting actual shingles then going back and getting the series of two. Hopefully by now my body has a good idea of how to fight the fucking virus.
3794,Did Not vote for him but since he won: The additional context was that the doctor just found that it looked like I had what seemed to be the beginningearly stages of shingles it was and they gave me the vaccine in hopes that it was early enough to stop it unfortunately it was not.
3795,Shingles vaccine experience: I had the e shingles vaccine no side effects nor any outbreaks of shingles in the several years after.
3797,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes I had chickenpox when I was about 14 months old. Unfortunately my chickenpox threw me into a febrile coma on oxygen for four weeks and my parents were told I would have brain damage if I survived. I have small holes deep in my side where the pox were that went down to the bone. No medication was helping so my doctor one day went in and busted all the pustules and my fever came down.
3800,Excruciating pain it feels never ending. Is this normal?: Welcome to shingles it normally sucks this much I also had it on my face and it managed to go in my eye a little bit. Pity your doctor sucked and missed getting you on the antivirals within three days. Ask for gabapentin one of the best for the pain but does take days to get in your system and get them to look in your eye soon as it messed up my vision in mine for quite a while and there is a chance of it becoming very serious.
3804,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles when I got Covid at 34 then I was able to get the vaccine because the doctor saw my shingles. CVS pushed back without an order so I got the order for the shot from said doctor and paid out of pocket for it.
3805,If I do not have shingles will the antivirals hurt me?: NAD but I suffer from a bunch of allergies have you considered an allergic reaction? This is the sort of mild hives I get from some of mine. There Is a condition called chronic spontaneous urticaria too which does not show up on an allergy panel.
3806,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I get vaccines and they do not work I NEED all you to get your vaccines so I do not get sick please. I have something called host related vaccine failure. I have had LOTS of vaccines and I have never had any immunities. Edit not the comment I thought would get a downvote today but OK then.
3811,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: Very hard to say sample size of 1 but my 9 month old son got the RSV monoclonal antibody when we was born in march. He is up to date on all his normal vaccines and also got the flu and covid vaccines in november. lol an vaccine person is crying somewhere. We have a kindergartener and have had a cold or stomach bug like every 2 weeks since school started and he is never had it worse than some congestion. Knock on wood
3813,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My Mom tried this. She said it was better to get it when I Am young. I did not end up getting them though. Instead my friends little brother came home from school with the pox while I was over there. I was 20 at the time. It was the worst experience of illness I have ever had. I had blisters in my throat eyelids ears everywhere. My fever was high and lasted a few days. I wanted to die. I cannot say I Am looking forward to shingles.
3816,Daycare does it ever get better??: FTM. This thread is scaring the shit out of me. My baby is 12 weeks and starting daycare next week. I got the RSV and flu shots while pregnant so I Am hoping those antibodies protect him from either all or the most severe of these illnesses. My PPD cannot handle watching him suffer.
3819,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: My doc had me wait two weeks between my last vaccine and start of biologics. The shingles vaccine is a bitch. I was 103 for a day and 102 for two days. BUT I have had three friends with shingles and would take a really bad week for vaccine recovery verse the suffering they had for 3 weeks to three months. One had mouth shingles and lost double digit weight.
3823,Hello everyone. Last year I had a really bad outbreak of shingles in my ear which caused facial palsy. Everything is okay now and I got a recommendation from my doctor to get Shingrix but she only knows one patient under 50 who got it this person has MS which is the reason they got the vaccine. I am otherwise healthy I do not smoke or drink alcohol and my diet is pretty good. Last year I had a lot of stress so that might be the reason why the outbreak happened. My question is if anyone has experience with fertile women getting Shingrix and if it affected later pregnancies in any negative way or if the outbreaks are more common after the vaccine. I tried really hard to look for answers I talked to numerous doctors but there is just no answer because they simply do not know. In the fertility part of the official documents only animals are mentioned. Any information would be helpful. Thanks
3824,Shingles again?: I think your Doc is ill informed as there are several young posters here with the double whammy. I Am so sorry you have to deal with even the anxiety of not knowing let alone the pain. I am just 2 weeks short of my one year anniversary and the PHN nerve pain is still present even debilitating at times. Sleep very difficult. I Am depressed at the thought of living the rest of my life this way. Good luck to you.
3826,"Painful rash on stomach after tetanus shot: Posting for my aunt 45F. She developed a painful rash on her stomach after getting a tetanus shot a week ago. The area is red, swollen, and itchy, but not warm to the touch. She visited her dermatologist who suspected a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine. They prescribed a topical cream and advised her to avoid scratching. She's concerned about the discomfort and wondering if anyone has encountered a similar issue after a tetanus shot."
3829,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick at all either time. My arm was a little sore that is all.
3831,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it as soon as I was 50. You really should be able to get it earlier. The vaccine was rough on me but better than Shingles.
3834,On the bright side I get to choose when I get the flu for a few days. Protip If you can get sick days do not waste your weekend recovering from the shingles vaccine. Edited to add I read the vaccine You do not have to wait to be 50 years old to get it if you have a weakened immune system. Ask your doctor.
3835,Hpv: Yes Just got mine in the past year I had an irregular pap this year which showed precancerous cells. Turns out I havehad HPV which after freaking out and then talking to my best friends 3 of whom are nursesNPs I learned some ridiculously high percentage of people have it have had it or will have it in their lives. So I went ahead with the vaccine because it will protect me from future strains if needed. I probably was not offered it in my 20s or declined it because I was in a long term relationship who I ended up being married to for 15 years so I saw no need at the time. I Am now divorced and have dated a few men and here we are Re the vaccine itself and how it made me feel it was a total nonissue. Other than a sore arm for a short time I felt nothing.
3838,my lil guy is a little over 3 months actual 6 weeks adjusted and we have been just climbing the preemie growth curve. yesterday we went in for the RSV vaccine and when he was weighed hes 10lb 13.5oz. it was not an actual visit w his pediatrician but i asked to speak to her for something else and i asked where he was in the growth curve. hes 76th percentile on the preemie growth curve AND we made it on the 5th percentile for the normal growth curve i wasam so ecstatic for him i know its only 5th but still i am also EBF and i am always worried about him gaining weight and etc and it just made my whole day
3839,Shingles shot Ack: The second shot did not bother me as much as the first if that makes you feel any better.
3840,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Someone told her break a leg
3841,Today I feel like I am in my 70s whatever that is like.. but i am going to this is not something a mid 40s woman should feel. My knees hurt to stand to walk.. they hurt. I have not been able to go to the toilet for over a week without being in a fair bit of pain sweatingI might pass out pain.. My neck hurts more than usual I cannot remember the last time it did not hurt it also means I cannot get comfortable in bed although I suspect my back sleeperantiagedo not squash your face pillow has resulted in this neverending neck issue so that is my own fault... Today my arm hurts like I have had a vaccine a new issue. I just washed my face and realised just how much it hurts to bend over to do it pathetic. I brushed my teeth and they hurt.. last night I had electric shock sensations in a new tooth numerous others were already on my radarthe RCT list something else that never seems to end. I have also had shingles numerous times so from time to time I get nerve pain today is that day all my right upper side is painful to the touch. My wrists are hurting as I type this. I have also got my phone on the biggest font and brightness and I am still struggling to see it.. I could go on but you get the gist. I have been on Hrt just over a month and I am pretty sure I just feel worse... Stay on it and ride this out come off try yet another type.. or come off it altogether and never sleep again Who knows. All I know is I feel shitty. Sorry for moaning.
3843,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I was 38 when I got shingles. Started in my ear was just on the right side of my face. 010 would NOT recommend.
3845,9 condition that would raise the risk of harm from a vaccine they should not be expected to take that risk. For example I am allergic to some component of the shingles vaccine the pharmacist tells me. I would like to have the shot but the pharmacist will not do it I would
3846,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: She does not in fact appear to be dead. However right wing propaganda reported she died. She did suffer a skull fracture and a concussion. She had felt dizzy before the set. Doctors were unable to diagnose an underlying condition and the fainting spell was not tied to vaccination.
3847,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Like other childhood diseases  Shingles is MUCH MORE PAINFUL than Chicken Pox. I once had coxsackie Hand foot and mouth disease that my amazing daughter gave me. Kids get this all the time  especially in daycare. It is nothing for them.....for adults.......MY HANDS AND FEET FELT LIKE THEY WERE ON FIRE. Literally  we were in the process of moving and I had to ask a friend to run the garage sale for me because I did not want to infect anyone but I also could not stand or hold things.
3848,ON got my RSV vaccine: I thought I may have been more tired but it is also the third trimester so...
3849,Hungry after second dose??: Yes I have felt this at times. I think its blood sugar getting lowered with dose and also the less we eat the more our bodies are hungry that is how we lose not eating as much. Yes the medication helps with this but I Have found this to be normal at times.
3850,"Does exhaustion from gabapentin get better?: I had shingles on my back about 5 months ago. I didn't have nerve pain in that area for a while after the rash went away, but this past month I have started having nerve pain in that spot. I got put on 300mg of gabapentin and few days ago. I take it at night since I was told it will make you sleepy and dizzy which it definitely does. But it's making me exhausted and unable to think clearly all day long. I was told I would get used to it and the side effects would lessen eventually. Anyone with experience taking it know when the side affects lessened for them?"
3855,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Ooohhh lol. I did not realize I had to go expose myself to more chickenpox to keep the singles away. Well I got shingles at like 29 and let me tell you it hurt like HELL. I only had a few spots but I do not know if it was because it was right over my hip bone but I woke up yelling in the middle of the night because it felt like someone was stabbing a screwdriver into my hip. Quite a terrible experience. Cannot imagine how terrible it must be to get it over your face or across your chest.
3856,Shingles vaccine: Get it I barely noticed when I got the vaccine I usually react to everything.
3860,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Definitely agree. I got shingles when I was 18 a few months after my mom kicked me out of the house. Now when I get stressed the areas where I had flair ups start to get that burning sensation.
3861,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same It was infinitely worse than Covid for me. I was RUN.OVER.
3862,I Am pretty certain I took my 15yearold daughter to an incompetent doctor yesterday at an urgent care clinic. She bit the inside of her lip at school several days ago and now its turned into this big white ulcer looking thing that is extremely painful. It was so painful she missed two days of school already. I took her to urgent care yesterday and the doctor was beyond odd. He acted extremely annoyed and would not look us in the eye. When my daughter tried to explain to him everything that happened he cut her off and just looked at it for about two seconds and said its a cold sore and prescribed medication. I do not have the name of the medication in front of me but it was a common antiviral. When we got to the pharmacy to pick it up the pharmacist said that he had given her a big dosage that would be more for shingles and that we should call the clinic and make sure this is correct. Long story short when we called he was very defensive at first and said that was correct. Two hours later the pharmacy called me and said that they had called back and changed it to a very short and very different dosage. Now I Am questioning the whole thing because looking back now if she knows for sure if she bit her lip and its turned into his big white ulcer why would that be a cold sore? And I Am looking at cold sore pictures too and I only see cold sores on the outside of the mouth and do not know what they look like on the inside. I Am so confused as to what to do at this point. She Is already had three doses of this medication and its not helped at all. Obviously we can go back up there and get another opinion or whatever but that takes time and she needs to get back to school and get back to her life. Does anyone have any pictures or know what an interior cold sore looks like? And can this happen from biting her lip? It just makes no sense to me.
3863,Shingles vaccine experience: I had both shingles shots and no issues. Like any vaccine in the arm move your arm around every 15 minutes or so for an hour or two after getting the shot. It really helps combat the soreness.
3865,Shingles vaccine?: But yes you should get it. I got shingles years ago and it was awful
3875,No subsidy for shingles vaccine due to high cost MOH: Is it because of the nerve pain?
3880,Neck is sore and stiff after HPV vaccine: Posting for my sister 20F. Her neck is feeling sore and stiff after receiving the HPV vaccine two days ago. She doesn't have a fever and the area is not warm to the touch. She visited her primary care physician who suggested it could be a reaction to the vaccine. They recommended hot compresses and gentle stretching exercises. She's worried about the discomfort and wondering if anyone has had a similar reaction to the HPV vaccine.
3881,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Of course it was not tied to the vaccine lol did cnn tell You that ?
3883,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: Not a doctor but my advice I believe she and wait up to 6 months for the second shot I would do that if I were her.
3887,Shingles vaccine: Its painful for sure takes about 24 hours but I did not skip work for it.
3890,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My husband had diarrhea for a few days after I had a fever for a couple days. It kicks you in the butt But it is better than getting shingles which I have also had.
3891,Put me out of my misery.: I Am not sure what the drug is but there is one you can get if you catch it quick. Like as soon as you think it might be shingles go to the doc. It only works within a specific time frame after it starts. It helps with the severity of the outbreak. I only know this because my husband had it a few years ago. We were out and about running errands one day and he said something to the effect of is there a rash or something on my neck? It burns and itches. I looked at it as were riding down the highway and there was a small area that was really red and sort of blistery looking like just beginning to blister. My sister has been a nurse for over 30 years so I called her. She asked a couple of question and said go straight to a doctor and they will give you a shot that will help control it. So off to the doc we go he got the shot and I Am so glad. It was painful and annoying as it was but never spread very much stayed on the side of his neck never even went as high as his hair. I have not had the vaccine and I Am scared shitless of it even seeing his case and some that were REALLY bad. Got To grow some balls and get it done.
3896,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Implied. One who has had exposure to chicken pox. I was exposed numerous times and never had an external immune response. My shingles manifested itself two times severely.
3897,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Make sure you have a few days off work when you get it. It kicked my ass for 3 days and what is worse is a booster is required six months later. I Am requesting vacation days this time.
3901,It is so odd. None of the COVID shots nor either shingles shot had any effect except a slightly sore arm. And I have never had COVID. Hmmm.
3904,Shingles vaccine: I had the sweats both times for a few hours. Having shingles would be 50 times worse.
3907,RSV vaccine: My wife got the RSV while pregnant to help get protection to the baby prior to birth. We were not informed either way which would be better just told that we could so we did.
3908,"Shingles with an infant?: Thank you, you too! Let's hope for a safe and relaxing weekend ??"
3909,Shingles vaccine: I got the flue shingles and tetanus all at on e. I was a bit wonky but you really want that shingles virus.
3914,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Yep same here. Last year I got the Moderna shot after previously only getting Pfizer and it was the worst yet.
3918,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: This is what I did for the second dose
3920,Has anyone experienced severe food or dye allergies as a result of receiving the COVID Influenza or Shingles vaccines? I can count on both hands the foods I can now eat versus what I cannot prior. I am always in a constant state of hunger. I am a 100 disabled Veteran 33 years served and I am about done with life and all the multiple health issues I am now battling. Thank you for listening thumbsuplightskintone redheart foldedhandslightskintone sleepyface
3921,Help I've been itchy for 3 weeks and my skin is bumpy and red: You can buy a mild hydrocortisone OTC in the US too.
3922,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got chickenpox when I was I think six years old somewhere around there. It was RIGHT before the chickenpox vaccine became more widely available before that my family doctor did not have any available to give me. And when I got chickenpox man I got chickenpox. My poxes had poxes. They were literally layered on top of each other like an itchy bump with an itchy bump on top of it or right alongside it. I did everything I could to not scratch because my mama had told me not to but I was six and inevitably I scratched. It was the worst experience of my lifethey were itchy oozy and absolutely painful. My entire body ached and my mom could not get my fever down for very long. My mom took me to the doctor because she would never seen chickenpox that looked that bad and my doctor even had to do tests to make sure it was actually chickenpox and not some other disease going on. I would not wish anything even close to that on any child. And it was not given to me deliberately either unless you consider the idiot mother who sent her chickenpoxinfected child to school rather than keep them home deliberate infection... But yeah the MIL in this story is absolutely insane. With the availability of vaccines for chickenpox that are safe for the vast majority of children I am not going to say allthere are always outliers there is no excuse to intentionally give a child chickenpox in this day and age especially since we know so much about the complications it can because a kid later on in life. I would not wish shingles on anyoneI had a coworker who came down with shingles and she was in so much pain from thatbut the MIL coming down with shingles afterward is totally deserved.
3923,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Hah. I had the first shot of the twoshot series forgot to follow up when I should THEN got shingles a couple months later. Was barely 50 I thank goodness I would already had half the vaccination because it was not too terrible. I took the antiviral med.
3926,Asked about shingles vaccine: I had shingles in 2019 at 53. I went to a concert in Chicago December 19. I was sick over Christmas with a chest cold. On New Years Eve I was in the ER twice in 12 hours because I was so sick and in so much pain. I did not have the typical rash. I went to see my regular doctor and they brought in a physical therapist because my pain was not making any sense. I had maybe five spots on the palm of my hand that was shingles. All my pain was going down the nerve in my shoulder and arm. I recommend anyone at risk getting the vaccine. I also think I might have had Covid and it just had not really been publicized yet. My immune system sucks.
3928,My son 33 yrs old and my nephew 35 yrs old both got shingles after shot My nephew could have been blinded because it was on his eye
3937,I Have had chrons since 18 currently 31. I take humira once a week. Vegetarian. In November 2023 I had shingles it passed quickly and I had a bit of pain after e.g. pins and needles. In the last 2 weeks I have started to feel more intense pins and needles burning sensations throughout the day everywhere in my body. I had some blood work done this today and I found out I am very low in iron lowest he has ever seen ... low in vitamin D ... but I have good levels of B12. I had been talking oral iron supplements for the past few months but my doctor thinks my body is rejecting them. I am starting IV iron injections soon. Has anyone had this experience before? Did anyone start getting neuropathy style symptoms i.e. pins and needles and found out it was because of low iron? Thanks
3946,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was vaccinated as a child. Ended up catching chicken pox at 19 from my mom who had shingles. Definitely an awful experience.
3947,Yes it got rolled out in the 1st shot I worked in healthcare and saw rashes shingles and herpes no sexual partner. Some worse than others but also saw it after the flu shot
3948,left side above my waist just under my ribcage.....its like i am rolling in jagged glass that is also on fire...quite the sensation for anyone reading this than is on the fence GET THE VACCINE for Shingles...you do NOT want this shit
3949,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles just a few months after my insurance refused to cover the vaccine. I was over 50 but this was when the first vaccine was out and they required you to be over 60. I seriously wanted to do some real harm to whichever bean counter made that decision.
3953,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I Am getting my second shot this month. I had no side effects from the first shot other than a slightly sore arm. I never want shingles.
3957,"Recently got my pneumonia vaccine as recommended by my doctor due to my asthma condition. The side effects were tougher than I expected - I had chills, body aches, and a low-grade fever for a few days after the shot. It was a rough experience, but I know that protecting myself against pneumonia is crucial, especially with my respiratory issues. The temporary discomfort was worth it for the long-term benefits of the vaccine."
3962,First shingles vaccine side effects: Had my second shot last week. The first was far worse for me.
3964,Rsv vaccine: I did not get the vaccine but my twins did at their 4 month visit. Big brother brought home rsv a few weeks later. The twins got it but it was sooo mild I was so happy I got them vaccinated. Mostly just snotty and a little fussyhad some trouble sleeping and they felt warm but never got a fever
3966,I Am sorry for her loss and the departed woman but an 87 year old dying was definitely the vaccine i guess: I know two people that died within 90 days of getting their COVID vaccine One was 83 with a 20 year long cardiac history the other was 90 something years old
3967,My kids work for DOD on military base. My son had it and then was MADE to get shot anyway. He is 34 and got shingles from the shot
3969,Shingles and other Vaccines: First round of shingles KICKED MY BUTT. I had it again about 5 years later and it was much milderI thought Id had some kind of contact dermatitisbut it was still burning pretty bad with my home remedies I do when I have a reactionso I ran to a walkin I use somehe looked at itand saidnopethats shingleslooks like its blistering up. SO GLAD he recognized it because I started the antiviral within 12 hours of the rash showing upit was an uncomfortable inconveniencebut totally bearable. I Am 34 not sure why this page showed up on my feedhad it twice. High stress individual and high stress job herebut I Am working on that to cope with life better.
3971,Naturopathic Clinic?: Yeah I Have had all the tests done. POTS is a diagnosis of exclusive so basically all the tests need to be normal aside from the TTT. High heart rate could be from numerous things but with POTS its specifically postural and when standing so you would not be able to figure it out from the pic you shared unfortunately. The trigger for you seems to be the vaccine just like for me it was the virus. I Am sure you have probably already seen that there have been other cases like yours after the HPV vaccine. It just really sucks that some people have the reaction and nobody knows why. Thank you for the links Ill have a read when I Am a bit less tired CFS is usually diagnosed by having PEM post exertion malaise. So basically whenever I overexert myself the next day Ill feel like I have the flu. LDN has helped a bit.
3972,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: IF I AM LYING ABOUT MY SHOTS MAY I BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
3973,Turned the big 5-0 today and I have questions: Quicksand was one of the big letdowns of our generation.
3975,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My daughter was not a premie but she got the RSV vaccine at 5 days old. It is an antibody shot only lasts a couple of months 3 I believe? I could be wrong since it is an antibody vaccine there really are not any side effects.
3977,Shingles shot: I remember my first one really being pretty bad and the second one being a relative breeze thankfully. But you know what? That is just a distant memory to me now. In the grand scheme of things it was honestly no big deal at all. And totally worth it as far as I am concerned. Shingles is waaaaaaay worse.
3978,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I actually had a bout of Shingles when I was 17 because of something similar to this. I was exposed to chickenpox and then roughly a week later per my mother she took me to get the vaccine. Whoops. Thankfully shingles was not too bad for me. The scabs took FOREVER it seemed to go away but other than that the pain was not as bad as the adults told me it would be.
3979,First Time w Shingles really struggling: My heart goes out to you. You are so pitiful. Yes my doctor gave me a pain pill. I had to use it for 7 days. You will definitely have to get one. Your shingles are very close to your eye so my primary care doctor referred me to an ophthalmologist. You will have to go too. I found ice packs were extremely comforting. My children also got me some Aspercream Lidocaine spray which helped tremendously. My ear and neck were in horrific pain so the cold spray felt so good. My shingles were so bad like you that my primary care doctor referred me to a dermatologist. He helped me so much. He prescribed some ointments which were very comforting. My severe pain lasted until Day 15 and then after Day 16 it went to a severe itching. My doctor then prescribed hydroxyzine which saved me. I took a 2pm and a bedtime pill. Also I was low on Vitamin D so make sure you are supplementing your Vitamin D. I cannot imagine being in Law School with Shingles. You poor girl. Please let us all know if you have any more questions. Praying for you. God is with you.
3984,Got vaccine today: Ah yes. And boy you just have awful luck. Have you had shingles before? I am just glad you recognized it and presumably got on antivirals AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I would let your medical provider know coz that is just really bad luck. The scariest thing is not even realizing it as a possibility. I am young early 30s and when I got it on my face below my eye I thought it was dermatitis or something as I still get pimples and have delicate skinrosacea. I count my lucky stars I work with people with disabilities and personally recently worked with a young guy my age out of work for shingles on his face or I probably would not have gotten immediate treatment potentially much worse prognosis. You stay healthy and safe this virus is brutal
3985,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I got RSV at 34wks. I also got the flu shot and covid booster around that same time like two weeks apart. Just a sore arm. I am so glad I did. Hes been sick a few times he had influenza an and we had ZERO clue until his temp went up a little at daycare and we took him in to the dr as a precaution. He Would been sicker with other things prior. Did not see that coming. His class also had COVID go through it. In hindsight I think he had it at the beginning with the others but his symptoms were sooooo mild. We thought it was just another little cold but until a couple more kids were reported with it. And by then he was already getting better. I normally do not get the flu shot but for him I did. And I Am so glad I did because I am very sure all of it helped him big time.
3990,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Damm it I just got my shingles vaccination 2 shots last year and it was nasty. Now I have got to ask my doctor about doing it again? Dr at.
3991,Side effects from radiation: I have Fibromyalgia and take gabapentin. One problem could be the dosage. 100 mg is commonly given as a starting dose and it likely is not strong enough to calm your nerve pain. It does make you drowsy so I would suggest only taking it when you are at home and are not driving anywhere.
3993,My DIL worked in public health. Did not want us in the house if no flu shot after my granddaughter was born. When Covid hit had to wear a mask and then would not celebrate the holidays with us. My son is a pilot so had the vaccine They had covid multiple times. He is had shingles.
3994,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: Piece of cake compared to TDAP and COVID. Felt totally fine after.
3995,Vaccine for preterm: I had a placental abruption at 30w6d and had literally just gotten my booster at my 30 week appt the morning before. Additionally they gave me the most painful injection into my butt about 20 min before delivery. I would like to believe she received some coverage from both of those as she has not had any chronic lung problems. She qualified for synagis in the nicu and beyfortus post nicu. Both provide great protection for preemies I would inquire with your neo or pediatrician about them. I also had 3 other kids in addition to my preemie so I fully understand the fear. The nicu really helped us to enhance and enforce our hand washing and germ control.
3999,For a 3rd time: If you do not mind me asking what autoimmunity do you have? I have thyroid graves. Shingles for my first time and it horrible pain 3 12 weeks now. Rash has gone but pain is intense. Just wondering if you have thyroid issue as well. I feel for you and anyone dealing with this horrible beast.
4001,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Oh you poor thing. The face and head are the worst places to get shingles. Talk to your Dr about upping your gabapentin you need it 3X a day not once and you need way more than they prescribed. I think I was up to 800 3X a day when I was at my worst my shingles covered approx 2 square feet of skin lower back ass cheek and thigh for reference. I also took ibuprofen and tylenol every six hours. Get to see an ophthalmologist your blisters are close to your eye this is not something you want to take a chance on go as soon as you can. Yesterday would be good. Get some calamine lotion for your blisters it provided so much relief to me it cooled the burn and dried out the blisters. Some people have great results with lidocaine did nothing for me. Ice packs also helped. Of course YMMV. Do not put lotions or creams on your blisters you want them to dry out. Watch what you are eating. You want to avoid eating foods high in arginine. Arginine helps the herpes virus replicate. Eat foods high in lysine and take a lysine supplement lysine stops the virus from replicating. One morning I forgot and had peanut butter on my toast my pain increased a lot for the next couple of days. From then on I ate just yogurt because I did not really care what I ate and yogurt if really high in lysine this went on for about 3 weeks. If you are in the US or UK get yourself some there is some evidence it can shorten the duration of shingles. If you are in Canada you are out of luck we cannot get it here. I hope this helps even a little bit.
4005,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I had shingles 2 12 years ago and after my sores healed I had nerve pain for several months after. I stayed on gabapentin during this time. I tried lidocaine gel it did nothing for me. I could not stand to have fabric touching my skin it felt like I was rubbing my skin with rough sandpaper which made going to work impossible then on this sub someone recommended capsaicin cream it worked perfectly. is the stuff I used but I am in Canada so you may not be able to find the exact same product. I was able to stop using it around the 6 months mark. I still get the occasional zap but it is nothing compared to the beginning. I do not know if it was you who was still eating foods high in arginine so if not ignore this. I was avoiding high arginine foods while I was sick one morning I forgot and had toast with peanut butter. Holy mother of god did my pain ever increase. Like ten times worse than before. Just my experience. And by the way youmanyamile knows her stuff. She created this sub go back and read some of her older posts.
4008,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same for me and my brother. We both got it I have it to him and thankfully aside from one little whoopsie poopsie on my part all we did was lay on the couch for a week and watch TV
4009,It is shingles a known side effect of the Covid shot.
4012,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My wife was 7 months pregnant when she got her first bout. There was actually concern for the baby hes just fine as the doctors did not have too much data to go on. She was miserable. Big belly and sores all over her body.
4016,Shingles and other Vaccines: I Have known people who got shingles even after getting the vaccine so I have not gotten it. Would Not you know I got shingles three months ago. It was awful I would not wish it on anyone but I was able to shorten the duration by using natural supplements. It was maybe three really awful days and it began to subside to where it was annoying and uncomfortable but liveable. I could work take kiddos to school and go about my day. It was scabbed over and pretty much gone in less than two weeks except for the red marks which I still have but they are fading. Not everyone agrees with this approach nothing works for everyone but it worked for me.
4017,It is my 36F first time having shingles and to be honest I think I have got away lightly. First symptom was intense back pain that woke me up at night. I was fine in the day and thought I would trapped a nerve or my mattress needed replacing. The pain was awful but only last 5 nights and was only at night then it went. 2 days later the same area of my back felt itchy. I thought I would irritated it using a hot water bottle to help the back pain that I would been having. The next day a little cluster of blisters appeared. A quick google pointed me towards shingles so I got it checked and confirmed. Started a 7day course of aciclovir that finished on Monday. My rash has dried up but since stopping the meds it feels like it is getting a bit itchy again but no new blisters or anything. I also have some itching on the front of my torso at the same height as the back rash but it is not joined up to the rash. I have been saying to people that I am fine and that I am really lucky to be getting through it without intense pain especially after reading stories on here. But I do feel so tired. I have pretty much carried on with life as normal working from home and keeping up with stuff apart from cancelling some social activities and not going to the gym. I think I am just wondering where I am at like is this hitting me more than I thought it had? I thought after the meds I would be back to normal but I am not. I feel exhausted and keep having little waves of nausea. But no intense pain just some weird burningtingling sensations and the itching is manageable compared to what it was. But the tiredness is worse than what it was last week when I was on the antivirals. So just wondering if I am maybe not giving this virus the respect it deserves and what it is capable of? Or am I being impatient with expecting to feel normal again at this point?
4018,Shingles and other Vaccines: My SO got shingles aside from days of intense pain like her Scalp was on fire it left scars. So yea you are being a baby.
4020,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: I have heard other people say that they got dizziness and tinnitus from the vaccine but most got better. Have you seen an ENT?
4022,Anybody else ridiculously young to have this problem? Genuinely some of the worst pain I Have ever felt. This time 6 months after the first time I had it the exhaustion and brain fog are so much worse. I Am a full time student and work part time I have not been able to go to work or school and I Have barely been able to complete any schoolwork because of the brain fog and fatigue. I Have basically quit my job at this point. I suspect it has something to do with my immune system last year I had pneumonia for 7 months which made me develop asthma and ever since I Have had a string of constant colds. Anyways just looking for support and advice on how to keep going
4023,Thought it was heat rash lol: I am 62 F and I went through shingles without antivirals. By the time I figured out what was happening it was too late for antivirals. The rash was not so bad I kept it covered in calamine lotion. Actually kept it so dry the blisteres never weeped they just dried upbut that lasted 6 weeks. The pain however was a different story it was excruciating from start to finish. Its been 4 months and I still have nerve pain. Praying you have an easy time than I did.
4024,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I never had chicken pox. I thought it was 60? My mom got shingles in her eye. Lasted for over a year. Permanent damage to her eye and vision. The ER sent her away saying she was fine. She showed up to my house and I saw the butterfly rash on her face and I told her she needed to go back immediately and demand to be seen again. Sure enough shingles. Had they caught it earlier and gotten her on antivirals quicker who knows maybe it would not have gotten so bad
4027,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus did not like that joke
4029,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Yeah, the night before is the unpleasant part. They put me to sleep for the procedure and I never felt any discomfort afterwards."
4030,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: Get the vaccine. It is a little jab in your arm. Protection from an unpleasant disease for the price of a small prick and a sore arm for a couple of days is nothing. I had three injections at different times because I got the vaccine while I was at secondary school but depending on how old you are you might only have one or two shots.
4031,Recurring shingles advice: Unfortunately yes twelve times now. Apparently some people just do contrary to most of the medical advice you get. It seems that the little shingles knowledge many doctors have comes from the single paragraph on shingles they read in med school. Fortunately even though my primary would not prescribe antivirals since it cannot be shingles again my ophthalmologist is on it like white on rice I have recurring facescalp shingles and my eye is sometimes involved. From reading Reddit you may think that recurring shingles is common but I believe that folks with the problem just end up here desperate for info and advice inflating the data. Nonetheless I wish the medical community would monitor this sub. I am sorry the antivirals have bad side effects for you for me it is nausea and exhaustion but I urge you to take them anyway. Untreated shingles keeps messing with your nervous system and can because permanent damage. Believe me I know. I got antivirals late the first time I had shingles and had facial nerve damage along with headaches for years. Once the headaches were finally gone I keep getting shingles. I must say your assessment really hits home I am sick of being sick. Well said. I hope you feel better soon.
4032,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I may extend my antivirals as well just because Id rather be safe than sorry and make sure its 100 done. I saw an ophthalmologist the other day eye looks good but I also have a follow up appointment in a week or so. I Am on gabapentin and have been consulting doctors to get a higher more appropriate dose than what I was started on. As for the some of my blisters that have scabbed over a few of the scabs came off in the shower tonight but Ill try to make sure I Am careful with them to prevent scarring. Ill look into the Mederma Thank you for the recommendations
4034,Re the quackery that is not hydrogen peroxide as a cure: I just want to say I had the same reaction on Gabapentin as you I was accused of being a mean drunk at work grocery home... then I laid on the bathroom floor over 10 hrs going through a withdrawal that I hope to never experience again and I had a better understanding of the struggles of drug addicts trying to get clean. I have had chronic shingles for the last 35 yrs and I am 57 with potential that it is hsv2 with MS mimic along with lesions on my spinal cord. I also struggle with the Vacyclovir it leaves me with horrid vertigo nausea and kidney pain. I have been thinking about getting the vaccine but man it will set my whole body off and I DO NOT KNOW that it will do what it says. Did you ever get the vaccine? While I find your experience interesting I do not know if it is for me. Thank You
4035,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I was getting them it felt like an electric shock running up and down my spine. I had shingles on the right side of my face in 2022 in my left ear in 2023 and above my left eye in 2024. I had a stroke a week after this year's shingles. I have not had any brain zaps since then which could be a coincidence. I saw a neurologist today and he was not helpful at all about the ongoing nerve pain I have said to talk to my PCP. He was not very helpful about the stroke either just said maybe I will get better maybe I will not maybe I will have another stroke maybe I will not. He offered surgery to place a stent in my brain but that was not what I wanted.
4038,"Second Shingles Shot: Lol me too! I had a high fever after the first, pain, can't remember what else. I actually told my husband I might have been a little delirious & definitely should not have been at work that day. So I took the day off for #2, and was a nervous wreck leading up to it. What a happy letdown that was - zero side effects, and a day off. Lol"
4039,Long Term Side Effects from Shingrix vaccination. Chronic ear pain dizzyness vertigo.: Sounds like you had a unknown viral infection causing you des equilibrium
4040,I just was diagnosed with shingles around my eye and it spread to my scalp. I was on vacation and had a flare up on the first day. This is the 2nd time I Have had shingles the first time I was 5 and it was down my spine. I only had a few spots but the pain is so intense and the headache is unbearable.
4044,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Also a side effect of the antivirals characterized as feeling weak and tired. That is exhaustion to me.
4045,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: The agonizing itching of chicken pox was when I first really became aware of my genitals because scratching them hit a little differently than the rest of my poxcovered body
4046,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: I had it and barely had any discomfort. Caught it really early on though so antibiotics did their job
4047,"""Have you experienced any unusual reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine?"": Hi everyone. I recently received the COVID-19 vaccine and have been experiencing some unexpected side effects. Despite being informed that the reactions are usually mild, I have been feeling extremely fatigued and dizzy since getting the shot. From what I've read online, these reactions are considered rare, but I can't help but wonder if there are others out there who have had similar experiences. It's a bit unsettling to not know anyone personally who has gone through this. If you've had any unusual reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, I'd love to hear about your experience. Let's support each other through this recovery process. Stay safe and take care, everyone."""
4050,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: I was warned about a potential case of shingles because it was a true piece Of info that went along with the pfizer shot that has been in the fine print since earlier on during vaccine distribution. It was being a reaction that was reported shingles cases. I got My shot almost two years Ago.
4053,Had shingles at 50. vaccine at 60 part one was impactful part 2 not at all. Hope never to have shingles again.
4054,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I actually laughed when MIL came down with shingles because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus that lies dormant at the ends of your nerves. Now you can tell your I hope soon to be ex husband that his daughter is now at risk of shingles as an adult. My FIL lost about 75 of his vision in his right eye because of where his shingles presented. Chickenpox is usually mild but shingles because permanent damage.
4055,Diagnosed today.: Hi My shingles started as a headache that turned into burning skin the next day. Then as that day went on I could feel it moving down my face towards my eye. Around the 1st week it was so bad in my ear and throat I thought I had shingles in my ear and down my throat but the doctor said they were clear it was just the nerve at the ear was so angry it was shooting pain anywhere it could. I did get blisters behind my ear. I only got a rash to my eye but the virus went to the tip of my nose. Day 57 were the worst for me. My face swelled up bad too. Take your eye pain very seriously. Any vision issues go to the ER immediately. I found ice helped the best. Best of luck
4056,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had it this past spring. It affected my right arm and my upper backshoulder. Was painful as fuck even as a mild case. They did give me some Tramodol antiviral pills and 800mg ibuprofen. Took 23 weeks to shake off.
4057,Realworld evidence from over one million COVID19 vaccinations is consistent with reactivation of the varicellazoster virus.  The risk of developing shingles was 0.20 for the vaccinated  0.11 for the unvaccinated. The difference was statistically highly significant P  0.0001.: Happened to me and it was god awful. Some of the worst pain of my life and chronic nerve damage for about a year and a half. I realize it s considered an acceptable risk of vaccines in general but I still had the right to be warned it was something to look out for or for healthcare work to even acknowledge the link after it happened. 2 doctors and 4 nurses and they all had no idea this could be a vaccine reaction yet it s well established and long known
4058,Shingles and influenza: I got shingles alongside Covid in March it was awful and terrifying.
4060,am really low. it will be okay... just need to get through the next 6 days. shingles fucked me up get vaccinated.
4063,I did not have any side effects from the shingles vaccination.
4064,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Can confirm. Got chicken pox as a child casually not at a chicken pox party. Then gave it to my father. I had some itch and light fever. My father almost died ok exaggerating but he had a really bad time and lasted longer.
4065,Shingles shot?: I got shingles at 30it sucked and it was very painful. Shingles appears on the dermatome layer and travels via your nerves. The pain you feel during shingles can be lasting if severe enough. I was recently recommended to get the vaccine even though I have already had the virus once I am 35 now Ill be getting the vaccine
4072,I remember. I am sorry I had forgotten that about you. We have been suffering together yet apart in our Shingles summer. Ugh. I am still numb around my ear but the feeling is slowly coming back. I will never get off my soapbox about Shingles vaccine after this
4077,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got to bite the bullet and get this vaccine Yeah I Have heard it sucks for a day or two after especially the second one. But you know what sucks more? Getting the Shingles especially if it decides to reside on your face. So I just got to decide when I want to feel like shit for a couple days.
4079,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got my first shot a couple hours ago Friyay ugh
4081,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: Getting shingles sucks just fyi it happened to my partner in her 40s and was terrible.
4083,Hi all I first got shingles n my face and body several months ago after my nephew died. Now before I had a chance to get the vaccine I am having a flareup brought on by stress. But I am not sure what phase I am in I did not notice any symptoms until two nights ago when I got weeping spots on my nose indicating the virus was in my ophthalmic nerve. I did have two sores on my face before that but did not recognize them as shingles. Anyway yesterday I got to a doctor then today I started the antivirals and saw an eye doctor who said so far my eye looks ok. Today I am noticing itching and tinglingon my face scalp and my eye feels a little puffy. My question is this. If the sores have already happened where am I at in the progression? Is it as bad as it is going to get already or can it get worse? Is it too late for the medication to help or can the virus affect different areas in waves? I really am hoping for some clarity Thanks.
4088,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I got the series last year after watching my 40 year old friend suffer through it and then end up with the nerve issues for a year. Also Canadian shots were 175 each and not covered and I felt like garbage after each one. Still sounds better than having shingles itself.
4089,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes this was common practice when I get them at age 3. And I got shingles about 3 years ago. Very very painful
4090,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: 33. Exacerbated by a job promotion with a lot more responsibility that totally stressed me out. I got a small patch on my neck my jaw and the tip of my nose. It still hurts like hell even with a very mild case. I am eligible for the vaccine this year too. Will be getting it as soon as possible.
4091,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep I had a roommate years ago that got chickenpox as an adult and it was really bad. He ended up in the hospital with pneumonia because the chicken pox lesions were in his lungs. He had spots literally everywhere on his body. It was crazy. I was super glad at the time that I had it when I was a baby and do not even remember.
4092,"Got my pneumonia vaccine today and I'm already feeling the side effects creeping in. The nurse assured me it would just be a sore arm, but I know my body and I always react poorly to vaccines. I'm bracing myself for the fever, chills, and body aches that are likely on the way. Why can't vaccines just be side effect-free for me? #vaccines #sideeffectssuck #notagain"
4093,I was diagnosed with mild case of shingles 8 months ago just a small rash on my forehead. Why not a full blown case? Because I would gotten the shingles vaccine 18 months earlier. You can still get shingles after the vaccine but in my case it was much milder.
4094,Monkeypox is a coverup for damage done to Immune System by COVID Vaccination resulting in Shingles Autoimmune Blistering Disease Herpes Infection. 1st map is where the Pfizer vaccines are rolled out. 2nd map is where there are cases of monkeypox.
4095,Did Not vote for him but since he won: My mother is 81 and had to pay for her shingles vaccine it was not free
4096,Diagnosed today.: I am experiencing three months worth of the same symptoms. I have what is called postherpetic neuralgia. You do need to see a ophthalmologist to make sure the shingles is not affecting your eyes. The shingles I had affected my cornea and I am on eyedrops for two months. You will need to see an otolaryngologist as well as a neurologist. There is medication for the headaches. My headache was a sharp stabbing pain that lasted for weeks then starts to calm down. Also lightning strikes in my eye and head my lymph node on my right side was also swollen feel free to write to me and I will tell you the doctors and what they said and how things are coming along. I am sorry you are going through this it could be a long time before you feel better. I know the pain is excruciating and it is impossible to function with it at first. Ice packs helps a lot and Tylenol until the doctor gives you another medication.
4098,I had both doses of the shingles vaccine and only experienced a sore arm but was advised that some people do feel ill afterwards
4099,Shingles vaccine: First dose? Bells Palsy. The doctor says it was not connected but it was less than a week after the first dose. I am not planning on a second dose.
4102,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Light case in my early 40s. The rash was not terrible painful but manageable. The exhaustion though was HORRIBLE. It took me 6 weeks to 2 months to feel close to normal energywise.
4104,When I got my Shingles vaccine the pharmacist warned me that is was going to burn going in and hurt like Hell afterward. I was lucky because none of that happened. When I got the Covid vaccine I felt like my arm was going to fall off. I would rather have that pain then Covid
4106,The shingles vaccine is no joke The second shot for me was not as bad as the first one.
4109,Shingles again?: Hullo. Pretty please err on the side of caution. Trust your gut and if you suspect its back then please get the antivirals. I am 43f. Few health issues like endometriosis and IBS late diagnosed ASDADHD still awaiting my diagnosis. Terminally ill Dad. Partner struggling with MH problems and huge financial pressure due to my inability to work. So yeah the struggle to relax and decompress is real. I am burnout and constantly overstimulated and having meltdowns. Anyway I first got shingles in August 2023. V2 dermatone on one side but it has subsequently switched sides. I have now had it 5 times maybe 6? I am Dory these days since then. Literally finished my antivirals yesterday and GP said it had been 10 weeks since last outbreak. It has just gone round and round. I am pretty destroyed and cognition is down along with eye and ear stuff and phn. Occasionally a bad meltdown will make the initial rash area red and inflamed but I have never had a huge area of blisters just the odd few. They clear up immediately with the aciclovir but it is just not happy going back into dormancy in my body. I am doing my best to strengthen my body and boost my immune system but honestly I feel like I need a month of rest and naps. Pfft I have rambled at you. Sorry. Please rest and get your vitamins in extra vitamin D and l lysine too I empathise with you because its not always possible to reduce your life stress. I really hope my burnout is to blame but it is hard to not worry.
4110,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Safe and effective. That was a climate change stroke.
4111,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus said yeah here goes more of my love BOOM
4114,Got my Shingles vaccine: My dad who had received all the Covid boosters available and both shingles shots got both Covid and shingles at the same time like 3 weeks ago. Then took both the Valtrex and Paxlovid together. He was moderately miserable with both still has shingles symptoms now. Poor old guy
4121,I Am wondering if there is anyone who got the rsv vaccine and went into preterm labor? I ask because my baby has a defect and we were denied fetal surgery to repair based on her particular issues because they believe she would benefit more from a full term delivery and the surgery would have risked that. I Am concerned with one of the risks of the RSV vaccine being premature birth and I want her to stay in for as long as possible with her issues. I Am just trying to see how common it might be?
4123,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Ah all those I remember but from reruns as I was too young to watch them in their original run. BY THE WAY got my shingles vaccinations at least 5 years ago. Dad had shingles and he was EXTREMELY uncomfortable to say the least.
4124,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it helps at all to know I never got chicken pox because I was vaccinated but I still got shingles when I was 11.
4126,Shingles second shot update.: I am getting my second one in about 10 days. Was fine after the first. Hoping the second goes the same. Still if I have a bad day after the shot sounds a lot better than getting the shingles.
4128,Shingles vaccine experience: I had no reaction to either the first or second Shingrix shot. No worse than a flut shot.
4133,Baby and me with COVID please help me not panic: We got covid when my son was 7 months old. He was a little whiny and clingy had a mild fever but otherwise fine. I hardly had any symptoms at all mainly just tired. My husband however was sooo sick. He had a fever and the shakes. He did not get out of bed for like 3 days. We both got vaccinated so I guess he just had bad luck. He never had to go to the hospital or anything.
4137,Put me out of my misery.: I was also recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. They recommended I get the Shingles vaccine AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I told them I already did it a couple days after I turned 50. They were happy to hear it. Then told me to get the rest of my current vaccines up to date Covid flu and pneumonia after I ended my Prednisone taper. So I have got 3 more weeks and I will be getting those vaccines updated as well.
4141,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Same. I get horrid flares with just a cold sore. I Am not screwing with possibly getting a shingles outbreak. My doctor recommended that I get vaccinated for shingles because I recall my 3 siblings being covered from head to toe with chicken pox but I only had one itchy red spot on my belly. Which my parents dismissed as a bug bite but my doctor told me not to risk shingles given my issues with cold sores.
4142,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: One of my best friends her job is super toxic short handed constant emails and she got shingles at 38 this fall. It even caused a face palsy that thankfully went away. I feel like the late 90s is when the chicken pox vaccine was a thing. I was born 85 got the pox in 2nd grade. My brothers born in 95 and 00 both got vaccinated. My dad had good benefits schools in NJ and my parents always got us our vaccines and on schedule except flu shots because my mother thinks we have flu immunity in our familyyeah. My brother had unconfirmed chicken pox as a baby in 96. My cousins had it and we saw them in the exposure period I would had it already and he only got like 8 spots.
4144,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Be sure to follow up because I forgot about it and got shingles at about 6 months after my first shot. It was not terrible but I would have preferred not to get it at all.
4147,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I got my shingles shots a couple of years ago and the only symptom I had was a slightly sore arm like with any other vaccine.
4149,Shingles vaccine: Got it. Not a single side effect other than 1 day sore arm. You do NOT want to get shingles EVER.
4150,Hello all I Am in my late 30s and was just diagnosed with shingles on Monday. I started on Valtrax later that day and have now taken full dosages three days in a row. Some things I Have noticed which I did not expect are a loss of appetite very noticeable abdominal bloating and frequent incomplete bowel movements. An important fact to note is that I was diagnosed with Crohns Disease eight years ago. I have not had any real flare ups since then and typically only go once a day so this is definitely abnormal. So with all of that said are GI issues a potential side effect of shingles or does it have more to do with the Valtrax? Maybe both?
4153,Shingles vaccine: I have had it about five years ago and barely noticed. But I generally have very few vaccine reactions.
4154,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My husband just had shingles. I got chicken pox from him despite me avoiding him as much as possible having it twice already and being vaccinated on top of it I work with kids. My daughter got nothing except too much screen time because her parent were useless. I could not imagine willingly putting her through that. Just damn.
4155,Booster issues in vascular surgery: There were 2 physicians in one hospital in GA who awoke the day after the vaccine unable to move. One was a surgeon. He went through weeks of hell trying to regain motor skills and walk.ONLY TO THEN BE DIAGNOSED WITH AGGRESSIVE BRAIN CANCER THAT KILLED HIM VERY QUICKLY The other had to relearn to walk etc. And a 5 year old who developed Guillane Baret syndrome and had to learn how to do basic functions over the course of 6 or more months. DID ANY OF THEM BLAME THE vaccine Not in public they did not. Were any of them reported to VAERS? Nope No one I know including dying young relatives or strokes my husband or any other nightmare symptoms has reported to VAERS. Id like to report my husbands but not without his permission
4156,Shingles vaccine experience: Same here. I had to update some vaccines after chemo and take oral antishingles medication even though I have had both shots. Chemo really messes up your immune system.
4159,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: 51 here got my first dose in September. Thanks for the reminder  I need to schedule my second dose next week. Shingrix vaccine hurts like a bitch but it beats getting shingles.
4162,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yep. That shot takes you out. It did with me too. Get the booster and know you are protected vs having a higher risk of getting shingles.
4164,85yo had shingles dx dermatologist 4 years ago. Physician group repeatedly suggests vaccine as part of Medicare protocol. The outbreak affected arm only with pain and rash limited to arm and shoulder. Rash lasted 18 months but pain gone in 4 days using Valtrex. Needed 6 months PT to use arm normally. Anyone have similar situation and what result?
4165,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: I ve heard having shingles can be ridiculously painful. I d rather feel like I have the flu for a couple days from the shot.
4166,"Just got my second shingrix vaccine last week and have been feeling really sick since then. Nausea, fevers, headache, fatigue, and more. Doctor said it's sinusitis but antibiotics aren't helping. Could this be a reaction to the vaccine? Any similar experiences?"
4167,Shingles vaccine: Getting shingles is much worse. Three weeks of itchy burning nerve pain. Get the vaccine.
4173,i am so sorry our childs chickenpox ruined your plans: Only if the unvaccinated person comes into contact with actual shingles blisters of an infected person. I am not saying that is impossible but it does not travel through air like a cold does. OP I hope your little one feels better quickly For what it is worth when my brother had it he was fine in three days. I on the other hand am immunocompromised and I had it for two solid weeks. I am American and you bet I got my kid vaccinated as soon as he qualified for it
4175,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: I got Covid and shingles vaccine at the same time and Covid and flu vaccines at the same time. No bad reactions for me. I do not think Id do more than 2 at a time but talk to your doctor. Just be warned that the shingles vaccine make you feel like a boxer punched your arm.
4177,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: I was guessing it might be like the Covid vaccine and my own doctor told me to plan to feel like crap for a couple of days.
4182,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I had a really bad case on my trigeminal nerve which got worse because the urgent care told me it was a rash and to put steroid cream on it. I have PHN now and it is pretty much the same. I started on pregabalin which was a miracle drug but now that it is only prescribed by pain clinics and not neurologists I was moved to gabapentin. That plus oxcarbazepine and venlafaxine make it pretty unnoticeable from 95ish and outside of those hours it is just a mildly uncomfortable sensation. Unfortunately the reality of it is that you will have to get used to it. Something that helps me is a saying in zen practice we must live with the pain of regret or the pain of discipline and it is up to you to choose. It might not be 100 applicable but I think the message carries over that you can either suffer from the pain and anger and so on from the misfortune or you can work to overcome this and live your life in spite of it. Best of luck
4186,"Shingles pain years later: I have a really nasty shingles case two years ago spanning two dermatomes (L1 and L2) I was 3 months post Covid vax and 6 weeks post partum. Now it seems anytime I get ""flu like"" sicknesses my pain is in the sale joints. The left side SI joint and hip. I had Covid the past two weeks and the nerve and joint pain is the same exact spots as my shingles were in, this has been my worst symptom. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm taking lysine just in case!"
4189,Any tips on how to make shingrix less painful?: Is it that it is painfully at the time of injection or very sore for days afterward? The soreness afterward is more an inflammatory response to the vaccine which is why the 2nd one is normally worse. Nothing you can do to fix that.
4190,Are you vaccinated against Chicken Pox?: 96 and I got the first dose in 97 and I currently have chickenpox thanks to my husbands shingles. Highly recommend checking to make sure you have had both doses of the vaccine. Chickenpox as an adult is absolutely MISERABLE. really hoping I make it out with as few scars on my face as possible
4193,"Second Shingles Shot: I had very little side effects. I planned for the worst too. Zero reactions to covid, and flu as well."
4195,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: Chronic shingles in my mid 30s. I got the vaccine as soon as I could. Had to pay out of pocket thanks US insurance
4196,Hello I am a 48F 10 days ago I started waking with acoustic pain in my right leg. This is not unusual for me as I have had sciatic pain pretty much my entire adult life. I had a microdiscectomy in my L5 S1 when I was in my mid 20s. Every day it was gradually getting a little bit worse. But then I had a rash showing up on my leg. Time to go to the doctor. She diagnosed me with shingles. She said that it can because some sciatic pain due to its location. The rash is on the front of my calf. Pretty much from the ankle to up to the knee. So I felt relief because I had a name for what was happening and I was put on antivirals which will be finished tomorrow. here is the problem. Every day the sciatic pain has been getting worse. The rash however has not done what shingles normally do and start to blister. The rash has just remained a rash. But the reason I am coming here is because I am literally typing through tears. The agony I woke up in. My leg hurts so bad that it feels like it needs to be amputated. I feel like I am dying. I do not think shingles are supposed to feel like this. I know that the shingles themselves can be painful but they are not at all. My leg from my thigh to my knee literally feels like I have been shot. I want to know if this is normal? There is no pain in the sight of the shingles. it is hurt every day but nothing like this. I mentioned that I have dealt with sciatic and sciatica my entire adult life. But literally it is never felt like this. I do not think I can walk. And now I am scared. I guess I am here asking if this is normal? I had shingles once before on my inner thigh and the only thing that hurt was the shingles themselves. I took some ibuprofen and have been walking around. Like every day I am assuming that this will help the majority of it. Although with the pain level today I am not so sure. When I mentioned to the doc the bad sciatic pain she said because of the location it was normal for me to have bad pain in my leg. but again this is agonizing. I would love to know if anyone else has been through this? Thank you so much for your thoughts in advance.
4203,Hello friends. Looking for some insight my Mom got the shingles vaccine and thinks it s caused her an A I Disease particularly GD. She has burning eyes lips face fast heart rate as in 120 severe anxiety and depression neither of which she ever had and now has at age 70 weight loss were these your first symptoms when realizing you had GD? If not would you mind sharing what prompted you to realize something was wrong and ultimately coming to the conclusion you had GD. Thanks everyone for any help you can provide hope you re all feeling well today
4207,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: What a lot of people do not know is that depending on a child's immune system they CAN get chicken pox more than once actual chicken pox and not shingles. My older daughter went to kindergarten with a girl who had chicken pox 3 times in 2 years. My kids both got chicken pox only a few months before the vaccine came out. My youngest was only 9 months old at the time and has lasting scars. This was at a time where children were being hospitalized in the LA area because their rashes were getting infected with some other opportunistic disease and I was a nervous wreck. Then the youngest had shingles when she was 11. She was miserable and just felt yucky even weeks after the blistering painful rash went away. To this day she suffers from various random rashes that I would bet are related. All this to say that purposely exposing a child to chicken pox is not a harmless act.
4211,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: That Is how I feel right now. Unrelenting stabby pain in my lower back.
4212,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My son got the Beyfortus vaccine I think he was between 46 months old? Born at 32 weeks. No side effects that I could see and so far hes been very healthy Hes now 17 months old and has not even had the sniffles

4216,"5 months after my outbreak, is skin texture ever going to go back to normal?: I had shingles back in July on my forehead, eye and scalp, particularly in my brow area is where the rash was worse. For the longest time I had a very dark spot there but it's gotten significantly lighter however it just seems like the texture on the formerly involved area just can't return to normal. Firstly I'd like to say I definitely have PHN, I still get pain in the involved areas, sometimes it's a spot on my scalp, sometimes it's my forehead, sometimes it's in my eye (I had iritis during the outbreak and it's a stinging sensation in the middle of my eye). The PHN seems like it occurs most often when I'm under a lot of stress which is often. It's not as severe or constant as the pain I experienced during my outbreak but it's enough to be distracting. Gabapentin helps, I take it as needed and have been for years to manage anxiety anyway. I notice my skin texture on the effected area will sometimes be smooth but other times small, colorless and painless bumps (kind of like whiteheads) just seem to pop up in the area often while the rest of my forehead is as smooth as a baby. I'm not sure if this is just my life now or what...."
4218,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: That sucks that you had such a strong reaction. The second shot is statistically the worse one so at least you caught a break.
4221,Flu and shingles shots?: I Have had them both and no issues other than a sore arm.
4222,Rapa and shingles questioning immune system modulation at such a low dose: It is terrible indeed rash is gone....but nerve pain lingers on half my torso. ugh
4224,Shingles vaccine: I had it a year ago. Sore arm no other problems. Have Not gotten shingles but it has not been that long
4226,Developed shingles 1 week after taking ozempic: Ok yes Ozempic can impact your immune system but so do many other drugs. Its not shown to be significant or anything worse than the effects from lack of sleep. It has to do with the antiinflammatory affects of the medication. However I would wager in a side by side comparison diabetes andor obesity has a larger negative effect. Also losing weight from a lower calorie diet can sometimes affect your immune system. I actually got shingles during my last major weight loss now that I think of it. In fact some studies are showing it actually HELPS your immune system by increasing the function of natural killer cells This is just a small study so far but its a good sign in some of the cancer preventive potentials.
4227,sorry to be short in my answer. The longer explanation for this is that my daughter had a bad reaction to the varicella vaccine. I know you did not get the vaccine but getting recurring shingles is similar to some of what she went through and the thing that did the
4229,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got BOTH shingles vaccine and have STILL had shingles three times.
4231,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles are no joke. I remember the pain and fatigue worse than a flu without the cough. Felt like I was walking needles even though it was midsection towards back. Minimal rash but wow.
4233,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shingles vaccine is adjuvanted to elicit a strong immune response that will likely protect you for a lifetime. An unfortunate side effect of a strong immune response is feeling lousy temporarily. But this is far better than shingles. Especially optical shingles. The Covid mRNA vaccines also elicit strong immune responses. Many people experience low grade or short duration fever and chills especially the first few times. I know I did. That Is how I knew i got the real thing instead of placebo during the clinical trial. The boosters were a nothing burger. For me. Everybody is different. Some react strongly to vaccines and others do not seem to be bothered. The important part is getting immunity from the pathogen it targets. Usually the side effects are minor compared to the infection they prevent or amelioriate.
4234,Shingles vaccine: I did not have chickenpox as a child BUT I had it TWICE as an adult. Yes I know you are not supposed to be able to get it twice but I got it twice about five years apart and gave it to me the only child I had the first time I had it and by the time his sister came along I gave it to her So Before the latest greatest shingles vaccine came out I was a good 10 years or so younger than the recommended age for the one that was THE one at the time when I asked my doctor if she thought it would be OK for me to get the shingles vaccine early considering that the virus that causes chickenpox and the virus that causes shingles are related and the damned chickenpox liked me way too much. She agreed but I had to pay for it out of pocket. A few years later when the current two dose vaccine came out they were advising people who would have the earlier vaccine to get the new one which I did. I did end up getting shingles probably more than once but I happen to be in my doctors office for something else when my left wrist was itching that is where it always starts with me and I showed it to her. Without skipping a beach she said that is shingles. She put me on whatever the medication is and eventually went away. I truly believe that my outbreaks have been much milder because I had the vaccines. I say outbreaks as in plural because often on and not at any interval that I can recall I would wake up with my wrist itching and red sort of like chives. I do not recall ever noticing blisters but that day I was in the doctors office there were blisters. I am glad I paid for the original vaccine and I am glad we went through the waiting list and the waiting period between the two doses of the newimproved vaccine
4235,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I get what you are thinking but that is not true. She was used as propaganda by the anti vaccine idiots they even put her in a film where they showed it and claimed she died etc . But she fainted she felt bad before she went on but she forced herself to do it because it was the first gig since covid and her family and friends were all watching. She fractured her skull when she fell it was not a gag. She is deliberately anti political but the fact she is fully vaccine up and open about it and she made a joke about god has led her to be targeted by the right. I could not find any evidence of her associating with them all the time got a source for that? That Is mine.
4238,My mother got shingles was in agony for 23 wks. She almost lost sight in 1 eye. It is a nerve infection?. They swell causing continuous pain . Get the vaccination even if need to pay.
4240,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: I have not got the vaccine for several reasons. Anyway since I got shingles I take 1000 mg lys in e daily. I had one spell this summer when I thought I was getting shingles again. The symptoms were identical to what I experienced the first time. Of course I totally freaked out and begged my doctor for antivirals and I upped my lys in e dose to 3000 mg a day for 34 days. The symptoms passed with no outbreak. I know this is not proof that lys in e work and the pain I was experiencing was not shingles for certain but I am sticking to my plan.
4241,"Recently got the HPV vaccine and now my friends and I have been experiencing some strange symptoms. One friend developed a rash, another had a sore throat, and I've been feeling unusually fatigued. Is it just a coincidence or could it be related to the vaccine? Has anyone else had similar reactions after getting the HPV vaccine?"
4242,Registered Nurses working bedside with MS on Rituximab infusions?: Hello I Am a bedside RIGHT NOW with MS and I Have been on Rituxan for the last six years. Aside from my first covid infection which was exceptionally terrible I do not get sick any more often than before. Your neuro can and should be arranging for you to get all sorts of vaccines in advance of your first infusion regardless of your age. Shingles pneumococcal a covid booster etc. Your ability to seroconvert after your infusion will be basically nil so get them AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I have not stopped masking at work or in crowded public places like airports or on airplanes. I make sure to keep up with my fit tests and I keep a few good N95s in my locker in case I have a covid pt or whenever I Am in a room with a trauma. Masks work. Hand hygiene works. I Have had covid twice and neither time was because of an exposure at work.
4243,Shingrix experiences?: How do you normally react to other vaccines? I have a hard time with all vaccines wrecking my body and shingrix was no exception. I do have many of my friends who have had it who had barely any reaction though. Most people have a reaction to one of the two doses and not the other. I would wait until the break if I were in your position. Fwiw I did not have chicken pox as a child but had the vaccine as a teenager. When i was pregnant with my kiddo about decade after the vaccine I was tested for antibodies and had none. My rheumatologist wants me to get the second dose and I am being a big baby about it.
4244,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I just got my second shot on Sunday. I did not have any negative reaction to either shot.
4252,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Came here to say that I Have never had the vaccine but my husband got shingles and it was not a good time It spread all across his chest and abdomen and you could see that it was following nerve pathways. It looked SO BAD. He had wounds. It also affected his bladder
4253,Shingles vaccine experience: I Am so sorry. 10 years ago one of my best friends had shingles. Over one week they spread up his neck his face and finally one eye. The pain was extraordinary sowas put in a medically induced coma for 10 days. They started subsidizing slowly. He basically had to relearn to walk could not drive for 2 months. He looked like a burn victim so awful Over the following six months of intense PT and dermatology treatment he was back to being able to live a normal life and only has some faint scarring. He came very close to dying. So yes my husband and I got the vaccines. He had zero side effects I had a sore arm. So worth it
4254,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: This is actually my second time with shingles. The first time I started an antiviral and broke out in a whole body rash. Dermatologist said I should only take it for very serious viral infections in the future due to the reaction so this time I am just going without.
4258,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: The procedure really isn't too bad. Honestly, the prep wasn't terrible either. Do, however, use a bit of caution with your first meal after the procedure. I would now advise against the shrimp enchiladas."
4259,Please help This is the first time i got shingles 41F Day 0 I had the usual very painful headache throbbing  its on the back of my head and left ear. Day 4  I went to the doctor she prescribed me 5 days of antibiotics as lymph node was swollen Day 5  Saw some blisters form behind the ear  googled and webmeded got some aciclovir from the overthecounter pharmacy  started a low dose of 400mg since i was not sure about self medicating Day 6  Went to another doctor confirmed it was shingles and was prescribed 1000mg valacyclovir 3x a day started taking it immediately Day 7 today  I have an allergic reaction all over my body like hives  went to the doctor again and was advised to stop all antivirals and was put on some antihistamines and told to just ride out the shingles. Questions are  Could i be allergic to valacylovir but not aciclovir? Since the rash should come quite quickly but it only started after the valacyclovir  Could i potentially take famciclovir? The doctor said he recommends that i just ride it out so he does not feel like i need any shingle meds anymore.  Is it ok to stop midtreatment? Would it make the shingles worse?
4260,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I also went to a chickenpox party as a kid abroad new employer in the US says they require proof of varicella vaccine so I had to get the damn shot. Worst vaccine reaction I have ever had having worked globally and had just about every vaccine available. But man I do not want shingles my grandpa had itand it was horrible I helped change his dressings and would not wish that on an enemy
4265,Shingles vaccine: I only had a slight sore arm. I had more of a reaction with the flu and covid shots.
4266,I had shingles on my face. Think on that vaccine
4267,Had the second shingles shot: My Dad died suddenly and got shingles from the stress. It was horrendous. Started round my heart and felt like I was having a heart attack which freaked me out because my Dad had just died of a heart attack. In addition to the grief I had to just lay around in pain and pray it did not get up to my face and eyes. Took 3 months to get back to normal.
4268,Second Covid infection halted my recovery: I have had COVID 7 times for certain with the first one in March 2020 perhaps twice more when the COVID test came back negative. I have had LC twice from March 2020 to December 2020 and again from March 2023 to October 2023 with two more infections in late October 2023 and again in December 2023. I have been fully vaccine and boosted the whole time but alas I live with a K6 school teacher that accidentally brings home everything viral. The last two times I got COVID I did indeed goes through all of the LC symptoms the worst these last two times were orthostatic hypotension pericarditis burning lungs unstable heart rate nausea chronic headache brain fog and high anxiety ... but none of my previous LC symptoms that included POTS post exertional malaise burning feet fibromyalgia difficulty breathing and a dramatic drop in VO2 Max. I also only had this shorter list of LC symptoms for about 3 weeks endtoend from the onset of primary COVID symptoms. The big difference between the previous COVID infections and these last two was the interventions I took. For the low T cell count issue I took H1 and H2 agonists Claratin and Pepcid. To quickly dissolve the COVID spike protein I took the combo of Bromelain and NAcetyl Cysteine. To stop the microblood clots I took nattokinase and serrapeptase. There is new research showing that these microblood clots also plaster themselves on muscle cells preventing them from getting oxygen and nutrients For the mitochondrial malfunction I took curcumin phytosome. For the COVID autoimmune issue I took Omega3. There are peer reviewed research articles on all of these that you can find on the NIH.govhttpNIH.gov website. The insights from ongoing research continues to provide me with optimism. I would be super happy if virologists found a durable curevaccine for COVID. I hope that you recover quickly this time around
4270,I Am 362 with twins so any day now. I Have had no complications so far but I am physically super uncomfortable. I woke up this morning congested and with a sore throat like I slept with my mouth open. No big deal. Husband and I went out for breakfast and the sore throat got worse and worse. My entire lower body got stiff I cannot fully bend at my hipsbackkneesankles. My ankles and knees have been swollen over the past few weeks because of retained fluid and the weight I gained but it was physically painful to get my shoes on today. Getting on and off the couch is a Herculean effort. I felt a little chilly so I took my temp 99.8. I tried a hot shower and a nap and felt the same after both. I called my OB office and got no guidance other than if I Am really in pain go to the ER. Babies are still moving but my belly is hard as a rock. I did get the vaccines for flu TDAP and RSV. My care team did not recommend I get the Covid shot. Is this labor or am I just sick?
4273,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I lost some vision in my eye too from permanent scarring I Am so sorry you had it I Have never been more pro vaccination than after I got the ocular Shingles lol. I told all the old people in my life to please get the vaccine.
4275,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I got them at 41. 4 years later I still have dead nerves from where they were lower back sound my hip to my thigh.
4277,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I got treated for Shingles at 3014 years ago. High stress job was the reason givenI also had ulcers also attributed to work stress just a couple years earlier. I taught myself to be more positive and to deprioritize work after the second episode. I guess I should note my boss had ulcers at the same time I did. I also had two peers who got shingles young within a couple years of my diagnosis. Shit was busy
4279,Shingles for the second time at 20: I Am so sorry that you are dealing with this I would imagine that the colds that you have been getting knocked your immune system down and allowed the shingles to develop. I got my case of shingles after a very mild Covid infection. I wish I had something that I could tell you that would help I have heard good things about iv vit c I did one treatment. It was ridiculously expensive And I Am not sure if it helped I was oddly fatigued with shingles too A lot of the fatigue was from the Valtrex and once that was out of my system I did start to feel better My dad had it in his twenties and has been fine ever since I am praying that this is your last time with shingles Just try to look at this time as recovery Rest and eat well You could look into supplements that may help strengthen your immune system or protect against shingles. Here Is a list of things I tooktake Lysineits a cheap amino acid that may suppress viruses B12i took a B complex. B12 is supposed to help with nerves Lions Manemushroom that is supposed to help with nerves Vit Dmay strengthen immune system Vit Cmay strengthen immune system Definitely talk to your doctor but these or other supplements may help you heal from shingles and hopefully prevent future outbreaks
4281,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: Got them on my hand at 45. Unimaginable pain. I laid on my kitchen floor with shades drawn drunk for two weeks.
4282,Da li je neko imao zoster? Kakva su vam iskustva?: Polako.. bice gore.. Imao ja pre mesec i po dana 42M. Porazno mi je bilo sto sam negde procitao kao da najcesce oboljevaju 60 ljudi.. Ako si citao ista znas da zahvati zivac zapravo krene iz nerva virus se probudi.. mene je prvo bolela ruka you ramenu kao da me je neko udario pa se spustilo par dana niz ruku. Bolelo je tako jako da me je budilo nocu. Onda mi je trecicetvrti dan izasao osip na vratu i na ledjima. Mislio sam da jedno sa drugim veze nemaju. Ali posto je osip poceo da silazi niz ruku otisao sam kod doktora koji je dao dijagnozu. Dobio sam antivirusnu kremu i lekove tipa 10 tableta dnevno rekao mi je to je pola doze inace se pije 20 tableta dnevno ko tiktak jbte.. Rekao mi je za bolove da pijem po potrebi. Mislio sam ma nije nista prezivecu kakvi lekovi za bolove.. Osip je prosao relativno brzo 7 dana mozda ali ostao je bol. Bol je konstantan i bas obeshrabrujuc. Koza boli kao kad izgoris na suncu pa kad se poceses pa ono 12 sekunda i onda bol jak. Tako isto. A zivac i bol you ruci me je nocu budio i dalje ili ono ne odapavam celu noc. Tu negde posle 1015 dana tako smoris se. Mislio sam nece nikad proci. I boli jednako i sve vreme dan i noc. Ne mogu da se namestim nocu da spavam. Jer nije do polozaja boli zivac.. A koza boli na dodir bezao sam od bilo kog ko hoce da me pipne ljudi kad se pozdravljaju osim od cerkice male koja mi se okaci na ledja pa trpim.. sta cu.. Ali posle jedno mesec da a polako je pocelo da prestaje oko 567 dana svaki dan malo bolje. Sad me skoro vise ne boli.. malo samo.. Sve sam prosao bez lekova za bolove bilo mi zao bubrega i jetre pa sam trpeo. Srecno. Nije drama ali nije ni samo tako. Pretpostavicu da zavisi sta i koji zivac je zahvacen..
4284,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: I hope your little one feels better My two younger sons both got rsv in November my 15month old needed a inhaler as needed and then my two week old at the time caught it and was hospitalized for four days. I was worried and noticed him having some distress. He is a month old now and it is cleared up but I was scared he even had the vaccine because he got it on the 8th after he was born it helped a lot. When we were in hospital he had xray and a few oxygen treatments and was on feeding tube and IV for two days due to him being unable to breath and eat. He is gaining weight again and follow up he was clear. I am too paranoid to go out unless necessary with how some people think it is okay to just approach and get close to coo at little babies.
4286,Moderna Shuts Down mRNA RSV Vaccine Trial in Babies After Shots Linked to Severe Side Effects FDA Document Reveals: It spreads easily and leads to coldlike symptoms such as a runny nose and cough. I gave my infant a severe side effect so that they would not get a runny nose because I wanted to show the world I am not an vaccine
4288,"First Pfizer dose today!: Update: it's been a week since my first Pfizer shot, I had 2 days of mind splitting headaches, then I finally broke down and took acetaminophen, the headaches resolved by day 4. I also had really dry eyes for a couple days. Looking forward to my second shot- 2 weeks! Got my first dose about 4 hours ago- Pfizer- am super happy. I'm having no side effects yet whatsoever-my arm isn't even hurting yet. I was worried because I did have a reaction to my shingles vaccine 3 weeks ago, and that made me think I was just gonna react to everything. Will update if things change, but so far so good! good luck everyone, it feels great to finally be getting some protection! EDIT: In preparation for the shot I took a lot of the advice here. I super hydrated yesterday, overnight and am still doing that today. This morning I took my usual supplements: vitamins B12, C, D3 (liquid, 3000UI), Zinc Quercetin, potassium, magnesium, a multivitamin, and my allergy meds. I did not take any NSAIDS today at all."
4289,Vaccinations?: I did not get any vaccines growing up crazy anti vaccine mom and started meds for AS before I was independent enough to get vaccines myself. I have since been able to get vaccines for shingles pneumonia and yearly high dose flu shot while taking methotrexate and humira now take enbrel. Insurance has only recently been covering shingles vaccines for people under 50 with conditions like ours but I highly recommend it. I had shingles three times and it was horrifically painful no flare ups since receiving the vaccine.
4290,Shingles vaccine experience: Yeah your mileage may vary. Personally I had next to nothing as a reaction both shots. But that is pretty typical for me vaccinations are easy. I will take that bit of good luck.
4292,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember this too. I got shingles at 26 years of age. It was not as bad as they advertised in the commercials. It felt like I had contact with poison oak on the left side of my body.
4293,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: This might be on my second account lol so the name might be different but its still me the 21 F lol. To be completelyyyyyy honest the nerve pain was a killer especially at night I would be on the verge of tears because of how uncomfortable and painful it felt. I will say though compared to some period cramps it was kind of like that but on my arm. Like that shooting a hole cramp we get sometimes is worse but also kind of similar. The blister pain was really only a burningstinging sensation. Depending on your pain tolerance it varies as well as I only had it on my arm which I would consider lucky as there are worse spots to get it. But still pretty annoying and painful. I still have some pains in my arm like 6weeks later but the rash is all healed. When my dad had it his pain lasted up to 2 months his was on his waist and was diagnosed later than me. I would recommend taking Tylenol to help with the pain and using ice packs I was using heat to help it but read that it make a it worse so Id stay with the cold compress. Feel better It will take a while to feel normal again I Am still on and off some days so do not worry if you think its taking forever because sadly it does take like forever You got this though Take the pills and apply the cream If the dr prescribed it stay strong and do not stress
4294,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had it in my eye and face took 3 weeks for it to subside and 3 months for my face not to look like I was in a car accident. I would have paid 20K to avoid the pain and suffering. It was sooo terrible.
4295,First Time w Shingles really struggling: That Is how gabapentin made me feel I Have never heard this. Why does it do that? I had a paradoxical reaction I call it. Caused me massive anxiety. Was a horrible experience
4297,me it is not routine in the uk when i was growing up people would have pox parties so their kids could get it over done with replies um NO that is just you because you are uneducated vaccine scum. my parents loved me enough to get me vaccinated. have fun getting shingles
4298,here is to ya bastards my loyal crew Taking Shingrix having had GuillainBarre I bid you adieu See ya on the other side: I had Shingles once. It was mind boggling how painful it is. So when I had a chance to get Shin gri x. I took it not wanting to ever go through that much pain again. I got GB S from the C covid vaccine the Shin gri x shots I had several years ago.
4301,Hundreds of teenage girls in Colombia struck by mystery illness All the girls were injected in recent months with the HPV vaccine Gardasil leading desperate parents to point the finger at authorities and the drug's American manufacturer Merck. THE CANADIAN PRESSAP Daily Free Press Charles Buchanan 2014 BOGOTA Colombia A mystery illness has overwhelmed a small town in northern Colombia as scores of teenage girls have been hospitalized with symptoms that parents fear could be an adverse reaction to a popular vaccine against cervical cancer. Authorities say they still do not know what caused more than 200 girls in El Carmen de Bolivar to come down with symptoms ranging from fainting to numbness in the hands and headaches. Some have hinted that the town of 95000 near Colombias Caribbean coast could be experiencing a rare case of mass hysteria. Parents are on edge however because all the girls ranging in ages from 9 to 16 were injected in recent months with the vaccine Gardasil. On Wednesday residents marched peacefully to demand a thorough investigation. Francisco Vega the towns mayor and a trained physician told The Associated Press that illnesses first appeared at the end of May and have been steadily increasing since. Over the weekend 120 girls were rushed to hospitals collapsing the towns limited medical facilities. None of their symptoms were lifethreatening and all have since been released he said. Echoing the assurances of national health and toxicology experts who have travelled to the town to collect blood samples and investigate possible environmental hazards he said there is no evidence the vaccine which has undergone extensive testing and regulation globally is to blame. Meanwhile Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria is criticizing hyped coverage by the media for stirring panic saying concerns about their vaccine which has been applied to 2.9 million women in Colombia are baseless. On one side we have the weight of scientific evidence and on the other are opinions and moral prejudices he told W Radio on Wednesday adding the cervical cancer claims the lives of more than 3000 women every year in Colombia. Veronica Trulin head of communications in Latin America for Merck said all lots of the vaccine including the ones sent to Colombia meet all required quality and safety standards. We do not comment on speculation about our products she said in an email.
4302,I Have had eczema on my neck for a lot of part of my life but eczema has been fine for awhile until couple months ago when itchy rough bumps have been popping up on my neck like crazy When I had initial bump I applied mild steroid cream which calmed it down and then it came back a week or two later. But when I applied the same steroid cream again it did not work So dermatologist proscribed me with stronger steroids cream and it worked But weeks later it came back so i applied it again and the same cream did not work anymore. My dermatologist did skin biopsy but nothing came out of it we suspected folliculitus at first. Nothing is working now and the bumps seem to be getting worse and worse. Dermatologist think it might be just eczema but I have hard time believing since I Have never had eczema like this before in my life. We also did skin patch testing to rule out product related allergic reaction. Anybody have a clue what this is? Could it be just eczema? Or something like molluscum contagiosum I used to do jiu jitsu til skin got crazy couple months agoor shingle? Any potential solution for it? Appreciate all the help
4307,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Like others said get to an ophthalmologist AS SOON AS POSSIBLE No joke I had shingles by my right eye and while I am very fortunate compared to others it DID permanently affect my vision.
4308,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: I had shingles on my waist when I was like 25. It was like someone stabbed me with a screwdriver and was twisting it into my pelvis. I will look into shin gri x
4309,Got my Shingles vaccine: I had zero side effects from either dose.
4310,Shingles vaccine experience: I had both vaccinations about 8 years ago. This summer I had ONE shingle. Just itchy. Nothing to complain about. Vaccine for the win.
4314,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: Our baby was fine with rotavirus at 2 months Just some extra poopy diapers. As a precaution we were told no one should change her diaper that is immunocompromised since its a live virus she would pass through stool. She also got dTap I think? and one other I cannot remember off the top of my head without pulling out her growth charts from the pediatrician. She never ran a fever did not really act fussy and we never had to give Tylenol She was a champ. When we got home from shots we immediately gave her a soothing bath and a warm bottle and she napped the rest of the day Goood luck
4315,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Have had shingles pretty bad twice and it sucks. not even counting the actual pain I just got run down for weeks and just generally just felt kind of dirtygross and off..
4318,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I sent a picture of the rash to my doctor with a note that it seemed to be some kind of contact dermatitis but I had no idea what I had touched. It was near the top of my forehead. She correctly diagnosed it right away and had me on antivirals by the end of the day. Probably saved my eye. Get the vaccine
4321,41 and got Shingles: I got them at 37 I Am 40 now. At first I thought it was a pulled muscle in my back but muscle relaxers were not working. Then on the fifth day I started convulsing from the pain. I went to the ER and they were treating me like a junkie trying to score some pain pills until my wife told the nurse that I was developing a rash where the pain was. Everyone Is attitude immediately changed and within 5 minutes I had a scrip for valtrex and a handful of hydros. I called my twin brother and told him to go get the vaccine AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
4323,Shingles vaccine: I had no reaction to the Covid or the shingles vaccine.
4324,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I got shingles in my optic nerve and it nearly blinded me. Get the vaccine.
4327,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 1991. Traumatized by the vaccine I remember being held down screaming for my mom. Then got chicken pox BAD within 2 years of the vaccine. Then got shingles by 32.
4328,Anyone experienced something like this?: Mine looked like that at the beginning yours look like they have not completely blistered. I also did not have any treatment for a long time. Once they blister that is when intense pain begins. Shingles are slow to erupt and slow to heal. Be glad it is on your arm and you can hide it. For me at that stage it just felt tight. I thought I had psoriasis
4331,your check-up check list at 50: I'm scheduling my long list of things to have done at 50 for November. I was told I do not need an annual pap since I was there for one last year and we now go every 3 years if all is normal. So: - basic physical - cologuard test - mammo due this year - skin cancer screening w derm - shingles vax - I am asking for an ultrasound - prob a t/v one to get a look at my ovaries as well since I am still having regular periods and still having O pain (always have always check out fine but I want a look) - what else? I did genetic testing/screening 3 years ago and my pap a year ago plus labs - my annual physical includes fasting blood sugar/a1c/ iron/ferritin and thyroid basic panel
4335,Shingles at 35: I got them in my hip at 39 during the height of lockdown and it took a couple visits to the ER to get diagnosed. Not sure if I missed my window with the meds but it was the most painful experience of my life. It hurt to move my leg so I stopped drinking water so I would not have to go to the bathroom so I got kidney stones along with it. I was off my feet and away from work for almost 6 weeks. I had to do distance physiotherapy thanks to Covid to relearn how to walk again. Used crutches a cane for months after and still have nerve pain years later. Got vaccinated against shingles at my own expense the first instant I could. 1000010 would not recommend.
4338,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: Ugh. I was relatively lucky got it as an older teen they say it is worse the older you are. Also on my trunk a nerve with endings all round my belly button and wrapping around my ribs to speckle up and down my spine. I would already watched my Momsufferwithitacoupleyears before and she did get it on her face. Said it was worse than going into full labor and she seriously considered cutting part of her face and forehead with a knife when the pain was so bad she got delusional and hallucinations. Even though mine could not have been as bad as hers since she was late 40s and I was 19 I thought often of her words and seriously wonderedif I could be really careful and barely cut into some of the nerve endings just enough so they could not transmit pain signals anymore. When the hot lightning feeling would build up from theintense throbbing pain oh man it was very hard to do nothing. Thankfully we were able to get me some of the medicine much more quickly than my mom got it and the pain calmed down. I have heard you can get shingles again in the same or a different area if you got it young. So at 50 I am definitely getting the vacc. The risk of me getting it again is higher than the risk of having the vacc aggravate my tinnitus. I like that math.
4339,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember the practice but my mom was not really interested either way. If I got it i got it. If I did not I did not. No big fanfare. Supposedly I had it but it was really mild. Maybe 1 or 2 itchy spots. I am still not sure but I definitely got shingles in my late twenties. The worst pain in my life and I have had children. Started with a sore stomach and back and thought I overdid it at the gym. Soreness turned into rash. Rash got worse went to the doctor and I remember them completely backing away from me. Said I definitely had shingles and the worst case they would seen. It is was on my back and traveled on the right side to my stomach. Took literal months to fully heal. Hurt to have clothes on. Hurt to move. Only good part. I am military and work with mainly older civilians. They were scared to death to have me in the office. It was bout 4 yrs prior to covid so the work from home was not an option. So I got to chill at home. Granted n pain because i could not lay down but still enjoyed the time off. Tried to get the vaccine after that just in case but docs said highly unlikely I would get it again.
4340,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Oh my god I Have never seen anyone else who had ocular shingles It was fucking AWFUL. My eye was so swollen and red any moderately bright lights were painful. Going outside in the sun was torture. Driving at night was difficult because all street or headlights had a halo. I ended up losing some vision in that eye due to the scarring. I Am so glad there is a vaccine now. I would not wish shingles on anyone especially in the eye.
4341,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My younger brother born in 89 got the vaccine.
4342,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My grandpa got it in his mid 80s he was in excellent health before but shingles and the lingering pain set off a cascade of other health issues that led to his death a few years later. Still a long good life but his quality of life in his final 5 years would have been so much better without shingles. So yeah I got my shot as soon after turning 50 as possible. And I bullied my younger brother into getting it once I realized he was 50.5 years old and had not done it yet.
4343,Shingrix?: I was just curious since FDA put an additional black box warning on the Shingrix vaccine stating that it has a potential for causing Guillain Barre syndrome an intense form of neuropathy. I am far from that class of indication but I have gotten autonomic neuropathy symptoms none the less.
4344,FluCovid vaccines: I had flu pneumonia and shingles vaccines this Tuesday and the COVID shot today in preparation of the start of chemo in 10 days. I also had a PET scan and an MRI scan this week. I am feeling like I went through the wringer at the moment my arms and one buttock are like swiss cheese... but it is worth it if it protects me from getting sick. My doctor strongly recommended getting them before chemo so I understand the hesitation about getting them in the middle of treatment. Still better to get them and feel a bit beaten down than to risk getting the real deal.
4345,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Following day 3 of possible early shingles burning from L groin to L butt cheek.
4348,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: My mum and grandma signed up for shingles jab at our GP after two relatives got it. One of them was hit really badly could not see was constantly in pain and bedridden from it she is in her 70s.
4349,"Flu jab area swells again 10 later. Should I be concerned?: Female, 30. Non-smoker, no drug use, light drinker, not on any current medication Yeah so on Oct 24,2022 I had a friend give me the flu shot (yes, she's a licensed doctor) and 1 round of varicella (1 shot per arm). I had no reaction either of them 1-2 days later except for some minor swelling on the day of and it went away as normal. Now, last night I felt some body ache similar to when I have a fever but I didn't have one and I brushed it off as maybe just being tired from the day. Today, I was fine but now that it's night time I'm having a mild case of the chills but no aches and I felt a little soreness on my right arm then when I rubbed it I discovered the jab area has swelled up again. No pain if I press/squeeze the swelling but there is a very small spot that feels like a bruise which I assume is the actual jab spot. I highly doubt my friend would deliberately try to hurt me but should I be concerned about the late reaction?"
4351,Last year I got a case of severe shingles. And I still have lasting nerve damage the post herpetic neuralgia. I unfortunately had the Pfizer vaccine.
4352,Shingles vaccine experience: Yep that shit hurts. Later my wife said you were not kidding
4353,"Shingles Pain: Hello. 42F diagnosed with Shingles Thursday. I am taking an anti-viral and the rash finally stopped spreading but it's about a 2.5"" band under my right breast around my back. The rash itself hurts but I've noticed I also have some strange sensations/pain in other places like from my hip to down my thigh and also a spot from my hand up my arm. Is this pain caused by the shingles too? Is the rash trying to spread to these places? It hurts to have anything rub up against these areas but there is nothing there. If it is Shingles related, will it go away once the rash does? My rash seems to be fading slightly but it never did develop actual pus filled blisters."
4355,Paroxysms of burning pain: I have had shingles several times and the first time I was on gabapentin. I did not have any painful side effects from the gabapentin I was on it for pain but it muddled my ability to think so profoundly that I came off of it after three months. Plus it did not subdue the headaches' intensity much so I decided I was better off without it. The burning pain attacks you described happened to me during one of my shingles relapses and a friend who also has had shingles described the same thing happening to himwhile he was driving. Yikes. So while you are not alone those intermittent attacks are not something you can easily demonstrate to a doctor. And man do they hurt. Neither of us was on gabapentin when we experienced this. I immediately went on valacyclovir and those symptoms subsided. I seriously doubt they are a phase of healing mine presented at the beginning of a shingles relapse. Also to note gabapentin did not touch the scalp itching for me. The only thing that helped is antihistamines which I have stayed on for ten years now. And if I miss a dose the itching is back. I stay religious about taking those after seeing internet pictures of people who have scratched until they have bald spots on their heads after shingles. I am glad you are improving and applaud your search for answers. Take care of yourself.
4359,Shingles vaccine: I got it and felt crummy for a day. Shingles is absolutely horrific and can do some serious damage like blindness. I am not taking any chances.
4360,41 and got Shingles: I got diagnosed with shingles the day lesions appeared. The stabbing burning pain lasted 6 weeks. I cannot imagine how bad it would have been had I not realized what was happening and gone to urgent care immediately. I still cannot handle some textures of clothing touching that area of my skin and I had it in 2020.
4361,I got my flu and covid booster. Not sure on others too. The shingles one know few had bad reaction to that one. It is two injections. Spaced few weeks apart
4362,Pregnancy vaccines: Surprisingly no The flu shot gave me the most soreness of the three. RSV I almost did not even notice because the soreness was so minimal. TDAP did not hurt going in or much in terms of soreness after which really surprised me
4366,At my most recent OB appointment I got my vaccines and we talked about the RSV vaccine as wellthis was new to me as I did not know this type of vaccine was an option. My OB let me know I have a couple options I can either get it between 3436 weeks and give baby antibodies through placenta or baby can get a shot once she is born. My OB also discussed with me that it is possible to because preterm birth and possible hypertension symptoms. Again I Am okay with that compared to the cons so I opted to get it instead of my little cutie having to get another shot on top of the ones she already needs at birth. My question is has anyone experienced preterm birth that also had this shot? From the research I can find the percentage is very low but I Am just curious about personal experiences. OB also said we are in a safe gestation stage where if baby were born preterm it would not put her at a risk for an extensive NICU stay. That did ease my mind quite a bit but my curiosity has gotten the best of me. Thanks for sharing any experiences I appreciate the feedback 3
4374,That Was It??: Hi Zep users. I started in April 2024 on 2.5 for two months and have been on 5 for the last month. I am doing well slow looser and feel great. Today I did my 4th round shot of 5 and the plunger worked and I felt a tiny sting. Nothing painful at all. The weird thing was that there was a drop of fluid on my thigh when I moved the pen away. is this normal? Does that mean that not all the medicine went into my system. It was a tiny drop I am just concerned because it has not happened before.
4375,Shingles vaccine experience: Same experience for me but I am a guy. It started at my armpit and spread across my chest. I had really deep and painful wounds for weeks. I never want to experience that again.
4379,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: A few friends have reported vaccine side effects like feeling as if they have the flu after the flu shot
4383,30 year old Female 55 180 pounds 8 weeks PP. I started off feeling really under the weather sensitive to the light sore throat swollen lymph nodes in my left groin and a red hot rash in between my butt cheeks thigh perineum. My family doctor quickly looked and prescribed me keflex QID for 7 days with no real diagnosis sent me on my way. Flash forward a few days and I Am really unwell. The rash is now blisters and I am now having a panic attack thinking the trauma from my birth has caused an hsv outbreak. I go to the womens clinic and she is thinking that it could be So she swabs me and sends me on my way with a prescription for valtrex two tablets BID. I am feeling worse and worse at this point. She calls me back in to tell me the PCR test confirmed I have shingles not hsv 1 or 2 and ups my valtrex dose. I am still feeling really run down and now just woke up to swollen lymph nodes on the right side of my body in my Armpit. Could this be related to the shingles infection or something more? Can it be coming out in another area? Or could there be another reason why I Am having such a weakened immune system beyond being pp having a lot of stress.
4387,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Yes this. If the common theme here is vaccines always make me sick so STOP for a moment. Think critically When I was a child there were 12 required vaccines now there are 75? Something is not adding up folks Medicine advances. Pharmacy and medical companies have gotten greedy. There are studies out there showing damage from vaccines including SIDS among other things. Most people carry shingles because we had chicken pox. We are at risk for it. Yes doctors tell us it will be worse without vaccines. Really? How docyou measure it? I personally will take my chance but I am grateful I have that choice. I do not want to argue or debate here. We are all suffering with a great deal of daily pain. Do you ever wonder why? Where did it come from? What about the sudden increase in autoimmune diseases ADHD autism? Could it have anything to do with what is in our food or pharmaceuticals? Is it possible that doctors keep us sick so we keep coming back? I know I sound absolutely crazy. However just pause and think about this Why has there been cancer research for 75 years and no cure? Well well there is no money in a cure. But biologics and chemotherapy are great money makers and they keep the patients sick enough to keep coming back for more Regarding covid.... I have always supported vaccines and what doctors say but I had a weird gut feeling about this Very weird It happened sosuddenly with no studies etc. Look up Event 201 on the internet it was a pandemic planning meeting that took place prior to the pandemic with Bill Gates and many world leaders. It is mindboggling I watched this all unfold. I never got the vaccine I begged my husband not to but he chose to because of employment. He worked for a large group of medical clinics. He ended up getting 2 doses. Well he ended up having a mild heart attack at age 52. This is MY family that was vaccinated My stepmother is paralyzed from the neck down and in a care center no explanation why except it started with blood clots in her lungs. My nephew passed in his sleep at age 39 of heart related injury. My brother in law had 2 heart attacks at age 59. These are all personal accounts not secondhand stories or neighbors. I can share many other stories but these are just my family. So I personally think vaccines because more harm than good. Start doing research but do not look it up on a Google web search browser. Try safari or duck go. I do not want to debate. I very much respect others' opinions. I just wanted to put this out there.
4388,I Have never had a bad reaction to a vaccine either and I Have had so many international travel. Shingles vaccine was no different than the others. Sorry you had a bad experience
4391,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles last year. On my face. Around my eyes. It was HORRIBLE. HELL ON EARTH. Get the vaccine.
4394,Oh good for you for adding in the shingles vaccine We had ours a couple of years ago right after my son had a horrid case of shingles at age 41. I was pretty stiff when I got up this morning but it is worked itself out. I do ok with vaccines thankfully.
4395,Second Shingles Shot: I am getting my first one tomorrow and am nervous I am going to feel like crap. Really hoping it turns out like it did for you OP.
4400,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles and the pain was indescribable I did not even sleep for the first week because I was physically unable to sit or lay down. It was like electric shocks through my back every few minutes. I got told I have to wait 12 months for the vaccine now but I figure as long as the side effects are not as bad as actual shingles it is worth the risk.
4402,I had a similar reaction to both Shingrix injections but I have had shingles several years ago21 days of intense misery so I am grateful to try to prevent it again. Just schedule yourself a few days R after each vaccine.
4403,Booster issues in vascular surgery: I lost friends and family over this shot. I want investigations. Now
4404,"Under 50 Shingles Vaccine Question: Does anyone know of anything that says you cannot get the shingles vaccine if you're under 50 and your immune system is not compromised? I'm 37 years old and do not have any diagnosis that says my immune system is compromised. I've had shingles twice in the last four months. At my doctor's appointment last week, I asked if the shingles vaccine could help me prevent getting shingles again. My doctor said it absolutely could help me and that she would send a prescription in to my local Walmart pharmacy for me to get it. I went to Walmart last night and the pharmacist flat out refused to give me the vaccine because I'm not over 50 and I don't have a compromised immune system. Everything I've read online (taken with a grain of salt) says the vaccine is recommended for people over 50, not that people under 50 can't get it. So I guess I'm trying to see what exactly is preventing them from giving me the vaccine, especially since my doctor prescribed it for me."
4406,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Do anything you can to avoid shingles. I had it last year 43M and it was the single most painful thing I have experienced physically. It was not even on my radar before it happened. I had traveled internationally the week before and thought I was maybe exposed to a chemical. I had issues getting diagnosed as well the first urgent care I went to thought it was an allergic reaction. Had I know this was a possibility I would definitely have looked into an earlier vaccination especially after learning members of my family had it.
4407,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Chicken pox is easier the younger you are when you get it. I got it in my early 20s and it was hell. I was down for about a week. Massive fever. Pain everywhere. I did not get itchy it just burned like hell everywhere. Full days I do not even remember because I was so out of it. It was awful.
4408,Shingles? Rinvoq?: Thanks so much for your reply. I thought Id update you as I tried to update post but cannot seem to manage it and it may help in the event of shingles. Because I have spondyloarthritis so I suffer from costochondritis but ribs on the other side enthisitis in knees ankles etc. and sacriolliac and spine problems I had four discs removed As I Have experienced shooting nerve pain before I initially thought it was thoracic nerve irritation after booster but Id never had it in that location before. Luckily because rheumatologist had warned me and I had valtrex in the house for cold sore after I checked CDC Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins website I took 1gm of Valtrex that night I posted and again during the nightearly morning when I woke with stabbing pain in the same detmatone area left flank The next morning I took another 1mg because I got the pain again. I contacted my doctor and she prescribed a 7 day dose of Valtrex. After 2 days of valtrex the shooting pain seems to be gone. Interestingly whilst researching if shooting pain can occur before shingles rash which it can I stumbled upon research that showed that herpes virus including hhv6 is significantly more prevalent in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and its thought that herpes viruses are involved in arthritis inflammation so a course of valtrex antiviral might be good overall
4409,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: Based on how my parents are, they would probably relish getting rid of it now, while they were alive. My parents somehow never used their wedding china until recently because my mom said that the manufacturer discontinued the pattern before they had finished purchasing it. I guess my mom decided that keeping it in a cupboard was wasteful, so just use a half finished set. Still, their set isn't dishwasher safe (which I guess 53 years ago people were more willing to deal with that,) and I told my parents to just toss it in the dishwasher now, who cares? If the glaze wears off, whatever."
4410,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Got it from my sister. 1987 Also in 2018 I got shingles on my face and ended up hospitalized
4412,Some Singapore doctors see more patients with shingles over past 2 years: Wife got shingles during pregnancy which affected her eye. Literally screamed out in the middle of the night nothing we could do to ease the stinging pain. Doctors tend to recommend not getting the vaccine while you are still young cos its damn costly. But fk it if you can afford it go get the vaccine. They should allow us to use Medisave for this.
4417,Title explains it. We have a 15 y.o. mattress. I got a fairly decent mattress topper like 4 years ago which helped extend the life of the mattress wo actually buying a whole new one but frankly as bad as my pain is generally 4.56 during the day the WORST is when I wake up is more in the 6.57.0 range... and I have to function because I take care of my mother snd my husband's father almost every morning wearyface Partially I know it is so bad in the am because I am wo pain meds during the night sure I am on a low dose opioid which is not quite adequate to handle my pain especially since I have been on it for a decade and have definitely developed a tolerance but I manage. There are people in worse pain frankly I had Shingles a year ago so pain that I used to think was like an 88.5 I now realize is really just not as bad by comparison facewithspiraleyes facescreaminginfear explodinghead pleadingface . And yes I have tried more than once to do without opioids I know to a degree they are absolutely evil AND I hate the hoop jumping I have to endure to get them including having a PM doctor who does not believe medical MJ can help so I literally cannot even try it wo potentially being booted from his care. And while I technically can make do wo opioids my quality of life is so poor that as a result I can hardly function at all not in a detox way but in a literally only can complete basic functions like drink eat go to the bathroom but that is IT. I have MS Fibro and have not had a painfree day even w meds for well over a decade. I have tried a decent chiropractor which I would hesitate to recommend because some are complete quacks but this guy is good PT warm baths every morning big help stretching walking yoga etc. However I always feel my absolute worst first thing in the morning like I am a piata that is been hit w a stick all night and I am desperate... especially now that I have started having hip pain in the past 2 years seems to be piriformislike though it is not a running injury for sure I am a side sometimes back sleeper though and my hips HURT badly enough that it wakes me up lately which interrupts my sleep makes everything more painful explodinghead facewithspiraleyes Wondering if getting a new mattress may have made a significant impactimprovement in managing pain for anyone here? Any thoughts or insight would be appreciated Thanks
4424,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: That is it I am getting the vaccination. I got shingles when I was 19. It was a tiny patch on my foot but it hurt so bad. I also had chicken pox twice when I was a kid. So I am kind of silly for not getting it.
4426,Shingles vaccine: Thanks for the concern. I Am in Canada so I Am not sure they how they report. I did have multiple techs looking at my doctor and a few heart specialists and although concerned they gave me meds and said to wait it out. I do not think it was the pacemaker itself although it did move a bit from the initial placing. Personally I think the doctor or maybe the leads before they settled in nicked my heart or the or the sac around it when placing it and they would not own up to it. I Am all good now and going harder on the cardio than ever before but it was concerning for a while.
4427,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have tried this but unfortunately they have said I do not qualify. I have autoimmune issues so I am actually the opposite of immunocompromised. I am high risk for stuff like covid but because my immune system is dangerously OVERactive not underactive. I just seem to be unusually vulnerable to herpes viruses as I also got reactivated EpsteinBarr which is rare and it gave me MECFS. And shingles in 5th grade is very unusual. But that is not enough for them to approve it I have always gotten sick easily but I have had a ton of immunology testing and they could never identify an immunodeficiency so it is probably just due to chronic stress from my EDSautonomic dysfunction. Maybe they will change their minds in the future but for now I keep being told I cannot get it. My mom finally was able to get the shingles vaccine when Shingrix came out she was 57 so she did not qualify for vaccine yet and she is still had outbreaks since but not as many. It is still better than nothing.
4430,No pain yet and the blisters are only slightly itchy but its very early on at this point 5 days. I was pretty shocked to hear from the doctor I had given I am only 29 years but coming here I can see its much more common in younger people than I thought. While there is no pain it creeps me to no end knowing there is a virus blowing up my neuron cells as I type this. I would be fine if it was skin or even muscle cells but nerves? That shit is me bro. Those guys should be off limits Fuck you nature
4433,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yep. The double shingles series of shots was worse than Covid vaccines. I like to say they prepared me for the pandemic vaccine
4434,Shingles vaccine: I had a fever and felt sick for 36 hours but let me tell you it was better than shingles. I had it in my eye and it was a nightmare
4438,Shingles vaccine: It was painful but so worth it I have been getting shingles outbreaks since my immune system failed in 2012 I was 36 so they would not give me the vaccine even though it should have reduced the number of yearly outbreaks and the severity of them. Which just a single dose so far has done.
4446,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I remember feeling notsoprettydamngood after mine. You will be OK after a few months.
4448,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had similar. A mark on my forehead that spread and then I woke with a puffy sack under that eye so went to walk in just to make sure everything was ok only because of the proximity to my eye. I was shocked she said it was shingles because I did not feel anything. It did however itch only slightly as it healed
4450,What vaccines were you offered before starting a bcell depleter?: I delayed my first infusion so I could do Shingles and Pneumonia vaccines. The nurses were confused why a 35 year old was getting them. I wish Id done RSV but it was not on my radar at the time and was not offered. Shingles hurt like hell. But also Id rather do it and not get Shingles. Yikes.
4451,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Really? Cancer is better than shingles? The first signs of shingles can be a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin a headache or feeling generally unwell Typically a blistering rash may appear a few days later on one side of the body only The shingles rash most commonly appears on the chest or abdomen but can appear anywhere on the body including the face It can take up to 4 weeks for the rash to heal. Usually symptoms improve within weeks however some patients suffer prolonged pain or other complications To be honest what you are describing sounds almost as bad as shingles.
4458,Shingles vaccine: I had my 2nd on Monday. Arms still a bit tender but overall no side effects. Get your shots kids.
4460,Anyone gets these regularly who did not get gardasil younger?: I tested positive for HPV after the first dose as well I hear this mentioned more and more now...then pap smears after were normal but still i feel like this vaccine in particular is just problematic
4462,I Am provaccination no secret. I had a friend who had a terrible 3day reaction to the Shingrix shot and I put it off for ages. Finally cowgirled up and got it. Sore arm like tetanus. Felt icky the day after but not outrageously. Relieved to have protection from shingles
4464,Shingles Sucks: Had shingles at 18 in the eighties Felt like a lit cigarette pressed on my back and ribs all over at the same time. Fortunately doctors back then were allowed to prescribe actual narcotics for pain.
4468,Lichen planus? Hello everyone so I am here to see if anyone else has experience something similar to what has happened to me since i cannot find much information on it. By The Way I am seeing a dermatologist. I started on the 2.5mg for a month then went up to 5mg about 6 weeks in on 5mg around 1011 weeks total since starting MJ i started experiencing some burning sensation on some parts of my body almost like a sun burn. I also started experiencing more nerve pain on my back where i had shingles almost 8 years ago. The burning pain left but the nerve pain stay and that part of my body started becoming itchy as well. After all that next thing i can remember is was this tickling sensation on my lip thought i was getting a cold sore but i did not then i started getting the same sensation on my palms then the soles of my feet. Then my palms and soles started itching a lot Next thing i notice was i started getting these pink dots on my soles then this big oval pink spotrash on my palm. And after that it all went down hill. I started getting all types of different rashes bumps blisters all over my body. I honestly did not think it was from the shot. I thought at first i was getting bit by something then i thought it was eczema. I went to the urgent center which thought was hand foot and mouth. Fast forward went to a dermatologist at this point i was covered in these things they did two biopsies. And after 2 weeks it came back as a possible drug eruption. Doctor says it has to be the Mounjaro. And she called these spots or whatever they are Lichen. I googled and found lichen planus and some of the rashes do look very similar to it some do not. I was advice to stop MJ for now as they check me for some autoimmune diseases which came back high and positive. And i am currently on Prednisone for 10 days. I also have to follow up with my Endo. That was the one to prescribe it. Inam waiting for further testings and seeing what went wrong especially after 1011 weeks of already being on it. Also want to add that i ended up going up to 7.5mg beginning of December which probably made the situation worse. Now my question is has anyone experience anything similar to this? If so what did you do? What did the doctor do? What was the diagnosis if anything? the dermatologist said i might be able to try something else but if the blood work came back positive for an autoimmune disease i might not be able to do any of the injections. Which i am sad because my A1c is at the lowest it has been since I can remember and I Have also lost 30lbs since starting.
4472,Shingles: After my first ER where I experienced total fertilization failure I got shingles due to stress this was about a week or 2 before I was to start stims for ER 2 and my clinic was fine to proceed. That ER was successful and neither the shingles or the antivirals I was on impacted my results Wishing you all the best shingles really was awful
4473,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: Finally I wish this was a thing before. Randomly developed shingles at 27 in 2020. I assume it was high stress levels dampening my immune system but it was NOT fun.
4474,First shingles vaccine side effects: This was me. Tetanus and shingles same day same arm.
4477,RSV vaccine?: I would. I did all the recommended shots except my son got RSV this last summer a month before he got his vaccine. I got the vaccine when I was pregnant so he was good for his 1st year. He was 17 months old. The doctors were all shocked he got out of season and subsequently everyone else around him except for me got sick. He never had to be hospitalized because his oxygen was good but he was coughing for 8 weeks. We did everything we could have done. He was still too little for anything like Mucinex and it is not exactly easy to teach a kiddo that age to cough up mucus in their lungs. He got sick from a friend who is antivaccine with a lot of small kids and they did not let us know their children were sick. The child who was sick was 5 months old at the time and I believe he is still coughing periodically. My mom and my husband got it and were miserable as well. It is a nasty virus. We got unlucky that it went through our household out of season. I would vaccinate for all the other viruses too especially the rotavirus. My little brother and sister got it in the 90s and I honestly think they both get sick more often as adults because of it. They both had to be hospitalized were spewing out of both ends fevers nausea and could not even keep water down. My little brother was almost 1 and my little sister was almost 3. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you can prevent your child from being sick Id do it. Caring for sick kids is heartbreaking miserable tiring and scary especially when they are still so young.
4483,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got both shingles vaccine as soon as they came out. I got shingles twice anyway but they were nowhere near as bad as my first bout in 1977 scrstched my way through Star Wars. Get the vaccine Get both of them. Shingles is NO JOKE.
4485,Shingles vaccine experience: Can confirm. We caught it early thank you paranoid hypochondriac wife and got treated quick and it was still a week of absolute misery. Everyone should vaccine up IMHO. 
4486,I was 1 of the dumbass's that waited then got shingles the single most painful thing I have ever experienced. Do not put off getting this vaccine or you will regret that decision for sure.
4494,Shingles vaccine: I had a friend in grad school that got shingles on his face...he was only 26. Absolutely the worst pain he ever had. The vaccine left my arm pretty sore for a day or two as did the booster. It is definitely up there sorenesswise with tetanus boosters. BUT you do NOT want to get shingles...it is literally the chicken pox virus growing in your nerves.
4500,A word of warning: I just had shingles and am still dealing with the nerve pain. Am pretty new to fasting too. Fuck.
4505,I went for my yearly check up with my Internist. They offered me the shingles and dTPA vaccine diphtheria tetanus pertussis. I doubt it for a moment but they insisted. I gave in and should not have. They gave me the dTPA shot and guess what? Been sick for 2weeks with Pertussis.
4510,Varivax vaccines: I am a 30 yo female no preexisting conditions who was recently five days ago vaccinated with Varivax due to getting hired at a hospital they checked my titers and chicken pox (as always) came in very low. It's been 5 days since I had the shot and am experiencing sore arm and itchy rashes. I have had shots in the past for varicella and I don't think I have ever gotten a rash like this and I had it when I was small can anyone explain if this is due to the vaccine.
4511,RSV vaccine: Mine got hers at the end of October when she was 6 12 weeks old and she did not have any after effects. Really glad she was able to get it before the holidays
4512,Shingles vaccine: Its temporary. Happened to me for both my shots.
4514,One doctor told us bed bugs but no one else has bites and no sign of them in our house. Another doctor said mosquito bites which is not it. Another doctor said hot tub rash. To me it looks like shingles but I do not know. It is only on him and it is only localized to his left thigh. He was vaccinated against chicken pox at 15 months.
4517,Shingles and other Vaccines: So is craving pizza after the vaccine. Its rare buts
4519,I am genuinely scared of covid now.: It can be extremely difficult when most of Media is bent on still gaslighting people that C19 is not anything to worry about. The responses here make my heart ache for those going through it. You are not insane you are not crazy you are living in a world where a BSL3 level pathogen has been allowed to run without any real consequences. We desperately need a sterilizing vaccine and until that happens it is a crapshoot as to how people will fare. I was one of the OG infected March of 2020. It put me into ICU. I now have three NDEs from it and I still have Long Covid from my original infection. I was asked by the ICU Nurse in her spacesuit Who do you want to say goodbye to if your liver and kidneys keep failing. My urine was the color of black tea my O2 saturation went down to 89. Shingles popped up as my Immune system was so worn down fighting off Covid and I had bilateral pneumonia to the point they could not see my ribs. I left the hospital not knowing that they did not expect me to survive. A month later after discharge my PCP had me come in one of the admitting nurses stopped by. Hey You are alive We did not think you were going to make it she said. I came all the way over here just to see you For an encore a year later LC gave me a DVT in my left calf that moved and turned into a fullblown Pulmonary Embolism in my right lung. Survived that as well. So you can imagine how much I am hellbent on never catching this thing ever again. Here is a few tips and tricks from someone who almost died three times from it and is still feeling the effects 1 Reduce exposure. If you do not have to be there do not be there. Keeping yourself out of places of infection eliminates the chances of getting it. You would not show up to a battlefield or walk into a housefire do not subject yourself to unnecessary risk. 2 MASK. If you have to go to places where there is potential infection and unfortunately that is everywhere you want the VERY BEST protection you can afford. N95s at the very least. I became a fan of halfface elastomeric respirators with P100 cartridges. Full face if I know I am going to be superexposed like on a plane which I do my best never to get on now. No surgical masks no cloth masks. N95s at the minimum. 2a FIT TEST. You need to make sure your mask is properly protecting you and not allowing unfiltered air into your lungs. Most manufacturers including 3M will have videos showing you how to fit test. 3 EYES. Eyeballs also have ACE receptors so you need to wear something to stop aerosols from getting into your eyes. Glasses Stoggles Safety Goggles all work fine. 4 Consider a CHG based Surgical Soap. The great thing about CHG soap is that it continues to kill bacteria and viruses on contact with your skin for up to 8 hours. Now remember that C19 is mostly aerosol based and not really Fomic that said I am trying to do my best to cut down on all avenues of infection and with my reduced T and B cells from C19 I do not need any other opportunistic infection trying to get going. 5 Do not be pressganged or gaslit into dropping caution. Yeah I would love to eat out love to go to a club act like none of this is around us but I never ever want to be that sick again in my life. I do not want to add to more LC symptoms and I am not risking my life for anyone. None of the people pushing you to hang out at the bar or telling you You have got to live your life will pay your ongoing medical bills or will even come visit you in Hospital if and when the shit hits the fan. 6 DO use things like Curbside delivery to reduce exposure. Not having to go into the Supermarket or other Infectoriums is worth its weight in gold. COVID is a living hell that I would not wish on anyone. I never knew I could feel the way I did and do I did not know a person could get so sick. I did not know sensory experience could possible get so very bad. I documented my entire 220 experience including tips and tricks I hope this helps Hang in there you are not alone. Best Z
4520,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Wait you can get it more than once?? I am quaking in my boots right now. I got shingles in my 20s and it was absolutely awful. I do not want to get it again
4522,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Both doses were rougher for me than the first Covid shot. Nit easy but way better than getting shingles
4523,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Listen, your odds of getting colon cancer are 1 in 20, and if you want to further increase your odds, by all means shit in a box. You can also do your own breast exam, but getting a mammogram is better. Wanna play those odds? Go ahead and free up the appointments for this rest of us. Thanks for your empathy"
4524,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had my shots as soon as I turned 50. Did Not bother me at all. Sounds like i was lucky.
4526,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: My dad did not get the vaccine and he got varicella zoster encephalitis. This started his dementia and ultimately his demise. Burying him tomorrow. Please get the vaccine and encourage those you love to do the same
4528,No Way. I am in health care got 12 the shot rhen got shingles and heart damage
4529,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I got shingles on the right side of my face and in my ear. It was like having hot knitting needles stabbing me in the jaw for days and no pain medication could even dull it. I ended up having slight hearing loss because the shingles affected my eat drum. I was denied the vaccine 8 months prior because I was too young and only taking sulphasalazine. 100 recommend getting the vaccine. Shingles can also get in your eyes if they appear on your face. It is not fun.
4534,Second Shingles Shot: Why do I always have to be the 1 when it comes to stuff like this? lol Vaccines scare me but I get them anyway. Why do they scare me? I got the measles from the vaccine when I was a little kid. My Dr. said to my mom well she must have got a live one. As I recall it was a very mild case and the only consequence it had was that we had to delay our trip to Kings Island that summer by a week or two.
4535,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Even with the vaccine my now 23yearold got shingles a couple of years ago. None of us could believe it at first but it was confirmed by 2 Drs. She was miserable. Wish you a speedy recovery.
4543,I have had shingles to. I am glad I got the vaccine now
4547,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: You can check to see if your country has opted for a different stance on recommendations for additional doses I am in the US. You may not be charged directly for doses but they are not free. Somebody is paying for them. The risk should be minimal similar to the initial series or any other routine vaccine. Usually soreness and redness at the injection site and possibly some fatigue or low grade fever for a day or so that is due to your immune system kicking in are the most common side effects with vaccines.
4548,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Oh God your face? I feel for you so much on this. Lucky it did not affect your eye on that side right? 17 or so years ago at age 40 I had them on the right back side of my head. Yep. Weeks of unreal pain. It is not the worst pain I have ever felt in my life I mean the worst pains of my life were awful but then it receded eventuallymostly. But the shingles pain was not only bad it was constant. I literally stomped my own toes to refer the pain somewhere else did not work. And I still feel it to this day if that area gets even lightly hit or poked like while getting my hair cut or something. The rest of the thread that is saying anything is better than the shingles ... they speak truth. If anyone's on the fence about the vaccine trust us and do not be on the fence. Endure the couple or three days of fatigue to spare you the shingles. You do not want the shingles.
4554,NO I would better not get this. I want to get a vaccine shot but am still struggling with bad S.E.'s from a shingles vaccine I am waiting for this to subside.
4555,Shingles vaccine experience: I am 47 and had shingles last year. That was the worst pain I have ever felt...those commercials do not lie I had it on the underside of my right arm up into my armpit and then down the side of my chest. Horrible. My parents got their shingles vaccine a while back...before I got shingles. They did not experience anything more than a sore arm with both shots. So...definitely get that shingles vaccine I usually have a decent tolerance for pain but shingles was no joke.
4557,RSV Vaccine: Definitely the shot. Being sickgetting a shot that causes your immune system to ramp up will throw off your blood sugar.
4564,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am genuinely shocked at this I Have never heard of chicken pox party also I did not know the vaccine was that new. I remember when I got my chicken pox shot my mom was super scared for me and my pediatrician pulled her to the side to explain the shot. I have never seen my mom look like that before she was stressed she gave in and I was vaccinated. In hindsight I wish she had let me to a pox party for her sake.
4565,Male recently had a penile biopsy that identified HPV16 infection I Have had unexplained symptoms of pain burning and fatigue for over 3 years. However for countless STI tests unfortunately this was not picked up to my surprise as now I know HPV is not done on a standard STI test What are the best tips to she wouldclear the infection? I was not vaccinated until I got the news I Have recently had one gardasil vaccine that has made a slight improvement AHCC worth taking? Doctors seem to say there is nothing we can do however online says there is immuno cell therapy research but this looks hard if not impossible to access without connections Anything else assist in the recovery process?
4568,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: I just felt tired and achy for a couple of days. Plan a light weekend and do it on a Friday. Remember, the symptoms are your body making antibodies - not from shingles itself. 2 days feeling off for single's protection is worth it to me. My mom had it horribly."
4569,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: how bad was your shingles? 20F here and am in the same exact situation. I had the vaccine and everything. the doctor said it should not last long but i am curious how bad your pain was and how long it lasted?
4572,Shingles vaccine: My wife has had shingles and also gotten the vaccine. Shingles is worse.
4573,Me. Gave me the shingles shot back in 2016 or 15 few weeks I got worse loss of balance weakness could not walk or stand for long. Doctors ruled out MS and a brain tumor I slowly got better. Now the shingles shot has the warning for GuillanneBarre syndrome.
4575,Finally free of genital warts. My history: No side effects al all from the vaccine 2 months and a half with no recurrence. I have had sex again
4578,Shingles vaccine: Please expand on hungover. Did it include nausea?Head pounding? Just super tired?
4579,Shingles vaccine?: I got the vaccine. It hurt at the injection site for a few days but better than getting shingles. I did not have any reactions though.
4580,Booster issues in vascular surgery: My MIL got shingles post shot. My FIL is in cancer relapse post shot. She is a nurse so it was challenge to oppose her opinions back then. I have never been a disobedient type until this issue either.
4588,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had my first case around that time. My second case of it was when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and I managed to give to over half the school since I had already had it mild but I had it and for almost a week I only had one spot on my chin looked more like a pimple than anything and a mild fever. Then in the 15 minutes between the nurse checking me in and the doctor coming in to take a look at the weird mark I broke out from head to toe. My mom narrowly avoid the doctor's wrath the nurse backed my mom up and was flabbergasted by the change. Turns out I had been contagious for that entire week. We kept very quiet about that since there were a lot of pissed of parents. In our defense everyone knew you could not get chicken pox twice and it was such an odd onset too. This was before the vaccine obviously. And I have already arranged with my doctor to get the shingles vaccine in my early mid 40s due to having gotten chicken pox twice iirc I am more likely to develop shingles earlier from that
4589,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: For those of us that only had mild chicken pox shingles can present with very little rash. Sounds great right? NO If you get shingles and do not get treatment for it the chances of postherpetic neuralgia is increased. Then all of a sudden you start having stabbing electric shock like pain for what seems No Reason At All Remember when you would test a 9 volt battery on your tongue as a kid. That full battery level on your skin. And it does not really ever go away. Get the shingles shot. Both doses.
4590,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I was one of the first kids to get the vaccine so hopefully I Am good but then again my sister 2 years younger also got the vaccine but ended up with shingles
4591,I avoided the shingles vaccine until I saw my spouse endure the agonizing pain of shingles. As soon as her case subsided several weeks of strong topical antiviral cream sleepless nights I got mine. The disease itself is fatal far worse
4594,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am pretty sure I was one of the first years of babies to get the chickenpox vaccine. I got chicken pox at 26. I Am curious to see in coming years how many other people like me still get it just way later.
4595,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: tldr  I have Shingles and it presented without the rash or pustules. If you have weird severe nerve pain  see a doc Jokes on me. I scheduled my vaccine and then got the flu and they would not give it to me while I still had a fever. Then 7 days later I go to the doc for some weird crazy relentless nerve pain in one localized spot continuing fatigue and a thumping headache that just would not go away. The nerve pain was firing every 15 to 20 mins and lasting 3 to 7 seconds. On a pain scale of 1low to 10high it is a fking 20 Contractions were not that bad No exaggeration. She said she was 99.99 I had Shingles. She gave me a full and careful once over looking for the rash or pustules and found none. Doc said it was rare but not unheard of. Put me on an antibiotic for Shingles. Have had 3 full days worth of doses and today is a very mild day. I have had maybe 4 zaps since waking. Here is hoping that tomorrow it is even less. You do not want this It hurts like a MoFo Get the vaccine
4597,Dementia. Shingles vaccine. I got the old one. Tough vaccine to take because of side effects. Increases inflammation thru the roof short term. I will keep thinking about the new one for now.
4598,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1996 cusp baby but def feel like a millennial gosh plz do not group me with gen z Vaccinated but still got it I got shingles when I was like 5. Ef that. I did not give the shot to my kids and I Am waiting until I find out people have it so I can throat a chicken pox party like the old generation
4599,I have an vaccine of any kind friend who refused the Shingles vaccine. She ended up getting Shingles so bad she was hospitalized for over a month on morphine drips. She now suffers vision loss because of the rashes proximity to her eyes and Postherpetic neuralgia.
4601,Valayclovir: Yeah I got the vaccine last year and the case I have right now is super mild compared to the last two times I had it.
4606,Hi I have had a rash on lower back and other areas on and off since the first round of TC. They switched me to Abraxane for round 4 and I finished my weekly doses last Monday. However I still have a rash. It itches like heck. I do not have any more chemo thank goodness but wondering if anyone else found something that brought relief to a persistent rash? I am taking Zyrtec and Pepcid x 2 daily. I am beginning to wonder if this is shingles that just will not go away or something. The rash spot on my leg hurts and if I put cream on the rash it burns. Any suggestions? Thanks for any input
4607,Second Shingles Shot: Same here. I was worried about the second but I had no issues.
4608,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I know two that had the shingles blisters inside their vaginas. Not a chance I Am willing to take.
4609,Second Shingles Shot: I had absolutely no side effects to both shots other than a sore arm. There has been a lot of fear mongering about various vaccines. Good to see the other side of it
4612,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got a weird itchy rash a month or so after my 2nd bout with covid. Turns out it was shingles. Luckily it was only a palm size itchy af rash. Went away in a few weeks was very mild for me.
4613,Shingles vaccine experience: Got mine as soon as I could. My reaction was worse than any flu or covid vaccine that I have had. Actual shingles on the other hand... Dad got shingles. Said the pain was unbearable and worse than he ever felt. A little context on his pain tolerance. Since i can remember this man put an axe through his boot taped it up and drove himself to the hospital. He had a kidney stone bigger than a peach pit surgically removed in the 1970s and rode in the front seat of the ambulance an hour to the trauma center. He avulsed 6 of skin from his shin and waited until I was off my overnight shift on the ambulance to go because the ambulance was for really bad stuff. 12 staples. Semi amputated two fingers with a table saw and waited for me to get there to put bandaids on. Yup it is a hospital trip and he still feels it 20 years later. So there is that.
4619,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Be glad you did. My wife got shingles and it was on her face near her eye the doctor told her if got into her eye it could have caused vision loss or even blindness.
4622,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: Omg I had shingles above my eyebrows in October and had a seizure. This migraine will not go away. But again I fell from standing and gave myself a TBI. Had 1 dose of shingrex and was scheduled for my next the following week. Did Not end up getting the second one because I was so sick I did not want to make it worse.
4629,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I was 32 at the time I had my case. I would just started a new job that was significantly stressing me out and I think it lowered my immune system enough to give it space to break out on me. My mom was older but had a similarly stressful financial event that preceded her case of Shingles too. It is opportunistic Another reason to manage stress in a healthy way whenever possible.
4633,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had shingles during my first pregnancy at 28 and it was terrible 010 do not recommend
4634,Shingles vaccine?: My husband had the vaccine. I unfortunately got Shingles before I could receive mine. I had to stop my meds HCQ and Humira for a month. It was hell. Get the vaccine.
4635,My daughter forced to get shot for job not only has gotten Covid multiple times but SHINGLES too menstral problems and picks up every respiratory bug going around.
4637,Shingles vaccine: I did not feel sick with either of those vaccines including the SHINGREX booster months later. My arm hurt but my arm always hurts.
4639,How long did you wait to take your newborn out? I Am more so asking about baby staying in carrier or baby wearing while you walk around a store or visit family. Not big social events or crowded areas. I Have seen a lot of people basically shutting out the outside world and Id like to know if anyone had a baby during coldflu season and continued their life while taking standard precautions and everything turned out okay. Just for extra info baby is breastfed mom was vaccinated for RSV while pregnant and vaccinated for flu and covid after birth.
4645,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Trish sucks so much. Its so much better to get the vaccine than chicken poxyou only get shingles after getting chicken pox. I know someone who was born right before the chicken pox vaccine and a few years ago his life was super derailed from meningitis caused by shingles the initial meningitis caused months of extreme brain fogfatigue he had to quit his job etc
4646,Its just awful. And not to scare you but the 2nd dose is 10x worse. I was taking 800 mg of ibuprofen and was still rocking back and forth in bed for 18 hours with the muscle pain. Shingrix is still a whole lot better than getting shingles though. I got it when I was 47.
4647,Baby RSV Shot: My baby just got rotavirus vaccine an hour ago OMG Yikes
4649,Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: Just remembered that when the nurses were taking my vitals before the mastectomy my temp was slightly elevated. I said maybe it's a hot flash. They chuckled and said it's not internal.
4652,I grew up wan autoimmune disorder which I still have. I had mild shingles 20 yrs ago. I had the 2 dose shingles vacc 5 yrs ago. 3 yrs ago I woke up wa severe rash on my right eye. Sent a photo to my GP. Confirmed shingles again. I now have post herpetic neuralgia.
4657,Oh man I never want to go through what you arehave been through so I went and had the new shingles vac. The pain for the last 3 days has been awful and a rash from shoulder to elbow. I console myself with your story. Thanks for sharing.
4660,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: My story is so similar. The chickenpox vaccine came out when my daughter was a toddler. My pediatrician did not believe me when I asked if I should also get it since I had never had it. He referred me to my own dr. They did the test which confirmed I did not have the antibodies. They gave me the chickenpox vaccine and told me to expect some malaise. I sure know that feeling now. I got shingles 20 years later. Made sense to me as a possibility since the vaccine was made from live attenuated virus. At some point later a dermatologist told me that was impossible. I did not believe him and now it has been shown that it can happen. I have actually had it again and my dr recommended getting the shingles vaccine. They used to say one could only get shingles once but that has been found to be untrue. It is thought that the shingles vaccine can prevent or reduce the intensity of further outbreaks.
4661,"Has anyone noticed their arm feeling achy in the spot where they had a tetanus shot years ago after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? It's not a full-blown tetanus infection, but the area is a bit tender and causing some discomfort reminiscent of the old vaccination site."
4662,My wife has had a TN flare up lasting now about three weeks. Excruciating Level 10 tear inducing and debilitating pain. She as diagnosed with TN about six years ago. ER doctor suggested stress related cold sores that coincided with flare up may indicate Zoster virus irritating the Trigeminal ganglion. Prescribed antivirals brought a couple days of relief but flare up since returned. Gabapentin and Tegretol no longer affective in managing pain. I read one medical account of TN patient getting relief from shingles vaccination as it addresses the herpetic zoster virus. TN symptoms were manageable after that. Anyone here hear of or experience relief treating shingles virus that could because TN symptoms? Bless you all for your courage enduring this TN hell.
4663,Postshingles neuropathy on my face is driving me insane 36: I get the leaving work. I did the same thing. I just felt ikky. Body pain headaches and extreme fatigue. I also want to get the shingrix. But my insurance said I am too young. I am trying to find a way to get around that. Plus I am scared the shot is going to make me sick again. Did it make you sick?
4664,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got shingles in my late 30s on my scalp it was the worst pain I Have ever had every time I get a twinge on the back of my head I panic that its shingles coming back. I did get the vaccine when I turned 50 but I still worry about a recurrence.
4669,has anyone tried getting another kind of vaccine like Tetanus shots T dap Shingles that helped LC. I know that flu shots have helped it short term for me.: I got LC from the vaccine I had to rent several noncovid vaccines to travel out of the country. It did not improve my symptoms but there was no worsening of symptoms either in my case.
4670,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I have one on my shoulder that never went away. lol
4671,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My brotherinlaw is in the same situation. I am so sorry Shingles seems truly awful.
4672,Shingles on my face and scalp: I did get checked out and I Am on antivirals and steroid eye drops. The headache made me think my head was going to explode. I am on day 3 of antivirals but about a week or so went by before I saw a doctor. I thought Id start feeling better but I feel even worse. When did you start noticing some relief?
4673,Shingles vaccine experience: Got both doses a couple of years ago. Uneventful then but 9 months later had what felt like a migraine for a month. Terrible pain on my left forehead area which is not a typical place for them when I had migraines in the past. The pain was constant cold compresses helped. I used them so much that when that part of my forehead went numb I figured I would damaged something. Then realized I could not move that eyebrow and my eyelid was drooping. No one could figure out what happened until I saw an occupational therapist months later big scheduling fiasco. He put the pieces together and the headache was really shingles attacking the nerves above that eye. I had chicken pox as a teen and have a scar right by the same eyebrow. He suggested that the virus attacked the same area as chicken pox. There was even a single red bump near the area that I thought was acne. Fortunately the OT has really helped. I still have some numbness there but can move the eyebrow some and the drooping is gone. Glad I got the shots  was inspired by a colleague who had shingles bad  but I believe it is possible to have a reaction up to 9 months later.
4675,Not always. My very healthy son got COVID early as a LEO. Now has Long COVID. He is unable to work has had thyroid surgery shingles mono and chronic fatigue among other things. My brother in law died. I have had every vac on time still got it was sick 3 weeks. COVID kills.
4681,BATTLE OF THE QUILTING SUBSCRIPTION BOXES Sew Sampler April 2024: I would not get the shingles shot. I have permanent tinnitus from it. I got very sick. There is a fb group dedicated to it and what happens. I got it because my late mom got encephalitis from shingles and I took care of her. I wish I never got the shot. I have logged an adverse reaction event with the government agency but I hate the ringing in my ears. Call the dr office and ask specific about baby. I am. It sure if it makes you she would the virus
4683,Valacyclovir Dosage?: Yes I would call the doctor I was subscribed that and I had an allergic reaction toit. Ending up at the er with a real bad reaction.Also I had the shingles really bad . Very itchy and painful lost of nerve pain.
4686,Recurring shingles on face and eye.: I also had it in my faceeye last November. I got the my 1st shot in January then March.
4687,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Yeah I do wonder if docs can write a letter for authorization to insurance about it for folks like us when so often we have such issues with bouncing back from illnesses and keeping a healthy immune system. I got mine after I would completed a round of antibiotics rare for me for a completely unrelated issue while also recovering from a cold. Feels more than coincidence...I suspect my blood cells were decimated and shingles was like I am out baby
4689,"My IIH meds are making me crazy - need advice please?: Hi everyone! I'm on day 4 of the medicine and I feel like Im losing my mind. I need some advice because the doctor that told me I have IIH is difficult to reach and wasn't very transparent about the side effects of the medication. Just as background, I'm in Egypt, where I work, so the medication names and types are different. I'm 30y female at 123 pounds/5f4in and was diagnosed as having IIH after the MRI/MRV came back normal. I thought originally that the headaches were regular migraines and the pain in my eyes were from possible nerve damage from herpes zoster (shingles in the eye) 2 years ago but the past month has been unbearable so I went to the eye doctor and from there ended up being diagnosed with IIH. The neurologist I saw suspects I got it after taking an antifungal antibiotic I was prescribed in early March. I was prescribed by the neurologist: cidamex and a diuretic for 2 weeks (plus another medication that is supposed to aid digestion with the medicine) and two shots of steroids given 2 days a part. The side effects on the box I can deal with: I have no appetite at all and occasionally my hands and feet tingle. My eyes are sunken in and I look a but scary. I feel very lethargic but I can deal with that. My problem is that the skin on my face, particularly around my eyes and mouth, keeps twitching and practically jumping. On day 1 I thought it was going to pass but it happens on and off and sometimes is very severe. When I look in the mirror my eyelids are visibly vibrating. I am unable to focus. My mental state has deteriorated and it's not even that I feel depressed. I feel conscious but unaware and unable to focus on anything. My doctor didnt say I should take off work but I work as an editor and need to be able to focus. I'm suffering at work, as I'm sure all of you do. The way my mind mentally feels is worse than any of the headaches I've had this past month. And the twitching of my skin constantly is adding to the madness. I counted the hours this time and my eyelids have been vibrating for four hours. Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be concerned? Many thanks."
4690,I had shingles earlier this year can verify you do not want that pain Got the first half of the vaccine last week getting the other half in 2 or 3 months. Then I am set never have to get it again.
4691,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: she falls as if gravity suddenly got like 3x stronger
4693,Shingles vaccine: No problems here. Only noticeable side effect onset was a sudden impulse to collect naked pictures of Earnest Borgnine. But other than that you are good.
4694,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: Yep When I had it on my face I got brain zaps. It lasted 34 weeks and was horrible but lessened over time and faded away.
4702,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Anyone have lingering injection site pain?
4709,I Have had my shingles vaccination. Dr at urgent care thought it was only an allergy. My regular dr today thinks it could be connected with my NASH liver disease
4710,two years before covid my father also got shingles days after the shingles vaccine. it took awhile before he admit yeah he got it from the shot it was not just dumb luck. shingles can be permanent too. the only way this ends is if all shot are banned. ALL of them. forever.
4712,I did fine with the shingles vaccine but I know quite a few people who felt awful for a couple of days especially after the second shot. My husband had shingles so I jumped at the chance to get the vaccine.
4714,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: If you are on day 3 the pain will probably get a little worse for a few more days then a little relief day by day before it gets better and if you scratch the blisters and they pop you will experience more pain than you could imagine they usually do not let you get the vaccine until you are 6 months shingles free so try to avoid all those foods and stuff high in arginine and caffeine and keep taking vitamins and try to avoid high stress till you can get the vaccines I hope they work for you if you have any questions ask away I have been dealing with shingles for almost 20 years I get them on my right side back and elbow and leftside upper back leg and once after an extremely stressful day I woke up with them in all those spots plus across my chest but still not as bad as yours but ooh that pain is no joke no matter what the size of the rash is some people do not even get a rash and some get internal shingles...ouch I also avoid hot showers jacuzzis the sun heat seams to activate them too
4715,Shingles vaccine experience: I did not have any reaction to either shingles vaccine. But I also did not have a reaction to any flu or Covid vaccine either. This year and last year I did flu and Covid together and I felt fine after.
4718,Experts urge vaccination as RSV and 'whole bunch of viruses' circulate across the country: It would be great if this vaccination was made free for infants but also the elderly. My parents were strongly advised to get the RSV vaccine as they both have conditions that might make an infection dangerous for them. They got them on Monday. It cost them 640 combined because it is only available on private prescription right now. I am glad they both have some protection now but that is unaffordable for so many.
4719,Shingles vaccine experience: My sister had shingles  I was not sure she would survive it. I had the original one time vaccine before they said you needed 2. I went back for the two after she scared me
4720,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Haha He was in a traumatic accident as a child that caused severe injuries to his head. Eventually one eye ended up shriveling and dying so they had to remove it and put a prosthetic in place.
4722,Has anyone who has had the RSV vaccine come out with a painful bump afterward? It is itchy and hot too
4729,The shingles vaccine sucks.: From my experience shingrix vaccine case of shingles
4730,I got my second dose last week. I never had any reaction to any vaccines except for the shingles vaccine But its still better than getting shingles. I got shingles twice several years ago and its very painful and lost days of work so I Am happy I got the vaccine.
4731,all shingles vaccine up fuck that sht 2nd dose had it before no fun 29 yrs old
4732,Hello I have not found anything related online and wonder if any users here know something about it or can make sense of this below. I am 45 and recently developed shingles which is a sign that the immune system got weaker I had experienced high stress. Now I wonder if there is a link to this outbreak to NMN or CaAKG two supplements I have taken. I am aware it just can be a coincidence and not related. Still I wonder if any of these has had an effect on my immune system or on my stress levels 1. i have been taking NMN at a dose of 500700 mg every day. For quite some months. It has boosted my energy. I had also taken TMG 2 g. Then I went on a twoweeks holidays and did not want to take the NMN powder with me therefore I stopped. At the start of my holidays I developed the first signs of shingles. Which then got worse and now two weeks later got confirmed by my doctor 2. for this holiday I also started to take CaAKG 1 g. As it also supposed to boost energy and help with longevity. I stopped CaAKG now and been taking NMN again. The doctor also prescribed some medication against the virus load. Hopefully it heals soon As said it might have nothing to do with each other but if you have some reflections on it is there a link possible? this would be appreciated. Thanks
4734,I Am a girl mom of 2. My oldest was born in October 2022 at 406 was a vacuum assist and had pretty bad jaundice. My water did not break I just started having back labor pains and my water was broken in the hospital. 27 hours of labor 6 hours of pushing. Second degree tearing and very traumatic for me. She was a strong eater right away and I feel did not sleep as much as my second does. My second was born on Wednesday at 384 I wonder if the RSV vaccine contributed to the early delivery. 14 hours of labor with 1 hour of pushing. My water broke early Wednesday morning and I had my baby by Wednesday afternoon. No tearing and an easier process. My second baby definitely sleeps more than my first did at the same age and is kind of lazy at points with nursing although she has a lot of wet diapers. She Is basically eating sleeping or pooping. She Is already trying to hold her head up and roll over and is very resistant to diaper changes
4735,Shingles vaccine: Felt mildly unwell for 24 hours after the second dose but that is it. By contrast have heard many horror stories about shingles. Months of severe pain concerns about losing eyesight etc.
4738,Had my flu jab last week. Unable to have my covid jab yet as I had covid 3 weeks ago. But the shingles vaccine made me poorly
4742,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Me too on the Covid vaccine. Doctors have lined up my first break outs with the vaccinations and boosters. After that it was like I had no immune system. And doctors have told me its rare but real. I take lots of supplements now. I Have had Covid four times despite being vaccinated for each strain. I am so sorry for our collective frustration and pain but its comforting to know that while it is rare I am not alone.
4744,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got vaccinated. Wanted no part of that
4747,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I really need to do this. I am waiting for some down time at work because I have talked to a few people who told me the first shot knocked them on their asses for a few days. One bad enough that she never went back for the second one.
4750,"Second occurrence of shingles following first Pfizer shot: I had my first bout of shingles in October 2019, and it was excruciating. The pain was unbearable, and I couldn't even eat properly due to the discomfort around my jaw. It was a terrible experience that kept me off work for a month. Fast forward to now, I am facing my second episode of shingles, which has appeared about 10 days after receiving my initial Pfizer jab. This time, the outbreak is located around my jaw and cheek area, with fewer spots, and surprisingly, I am experiencing minimal pain. Working from home has been a blessing as I don't have to worry about others seeing my scabby face. My doctor confirmed it as shingles during a Zoom consultation, and I have reported it to the Yellow Card system. Given that it's uncommon to have shingles multiple times, I am curious if anyone fully vaccinated has experienced it after each vaccination. Since this episode is relatively mild, I am hopeful that any potential future occurrences would also be less severe. Just intrigued by the situation and wondering about others' experiences. Edit: I'm not complaining, as dealing with shingles is definitely preferable to contracting COVID-19. ---"
4753,Second Shingles Shot: I get my flu shots pretty regularly but shingles was not available when I got it years ago. I Have had shingles 2xs in my 40s the first time I caught it early went to an ER in the middle of the night because I had a little thumbprint size of a couple blisters and it was at the edge of my tshirt. I first thought it may be acid that I had been working with wearing gloves and accidentally touched my skin. But upon reading the internet I had the low stabbing nerve pain up my arm a couple days already. There I sat in a big isolation room at the ER alonefeeling rediculousbut Dr came in and looked and said yep that is shingles starting. The sooner you get on antivirals the better and possibly keep permanent nerve pain away. It worked The second time I had a tingling feeling up my arm to the same place as before but no mark yet. I def realized it was the same pain and just went to pcp took antivirals again and it did not break out and pain went away. For about 16 yrs I do not think I Have had another event but it did happen at extremely stressful times. Best wishes to you all. Its good to know the symptoms and higher risks as we age.
4758,Shingles vaccine: have not had the shingles vaccine yet but I find any vaccine I get I run high for a few days after which makes sense when you figure the vaccine is making you sick to make you less sick later.
4763,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I got several different opinions from my doctors. I finally spoke with a nurse who had also had shingles. She suggested I have my blood tested to see if it was still active in my system. I went for blood tests every three months. The fifth time I went in it was cleared from my blood. That is when I went for the shingles vaccine. It has been four years now so far so good no recurrences. I do not ever want to have to deal with shingles again.It was absolutely horrific.
4764,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I did. Need another. It hurts worse than any vaccine ever. They usually do not bother me at all Other than that no side effects. I have heard others have side effects with the second one. My husband and cousin both had shingles and I do not want them...
4766,Baby RSV Shot: We got ours a week after his 4 month shots. He barely cried after getting it which has not been the case for his other shots hes received.
4768,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the chickenpox vaccine as a child and still gotget shingles I have had it four times since I was fourteen too. There is a study that shows it may be a sign I am developing MS.
4773,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: My LO got hers at her first appointment 6 days old no reaction whatsoever.
4774,Under 35 with Shingles?: My neck and shoulder. It is causing pain and discomfort. It is also getting VERY itchy.
4778,Shingles shot kicked my ass but its not Shingles and that will be 10000 times worse than any vaccine.
4779,I had no reaction to either shot. Have never had with any shot. I know people who had shingles it is debilitating. One was off work for months.
4781,Put me out of my misery.: Yup. Both shots sucks. What sucks even more is getting shingles.
4783,Shingles vaccine second dose: I did not have any significant effects from either other than a sort shoulder. I still called in sick after the 2nd one tho bc totally believable
4784,Hey everyone My 5 year old daughter had a scratch looking like thing on her back first noticed august 5. August 8 it was swollen and irritated we thought maybe it was a reaction to a band aid. I went out of town and asked her grandparents to keep an eye on it. Came home august 15 th to a massive spread weepy vestibules scabs spread all over her back neck arms and nose. Took her to urgent care they prescribed ce ph alex in and swabbed. I ve asked many healthcare professionals. Ideas that have been floated are Impetigo except the way it started on her back before spreading to her nose is weird Breakthrough shingles chicken pox but she has two dose of the vaccine. She has had no fever. Maybe a change in appetite I haven t been home but according to grandparents she hasn t eaten much. We are currently located in the Bay Area of California. No poison ivy or oak around. I m curious to hear your thoughts Pictures linked here
4786,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My premie received it and I do not recall him having any side effects I believe its just antibodies and not an actual vaccine that causes an immune response per se. I could be completely wrong though
4789,Vaccines: I found a current CDC article that says it is okay to take NSAIDs Tylenol and other overthecounter pain relievers when you have had a vaccine and that it will NOT interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. I used to feel terrible after many vaccines and it worked for me. That said Shingles especially round 2 is infamous. I would never shun a vaccine due to a day or two of discomfort though.
4792,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: We were actually exposed multiple times because my mom wanted us to get it naturally and never caught it... eventually my mom and pediatrician just shrugged and we got the vaccine
4794,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: My husband was that age too. And he also got Ramsay Hunt Syndrome from it. Fortunately he made a full recovery. Some people only recover partially or not at all. Needless to say I got vaccinated when I was old enough.
4795,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: It itches but it feels weird like it is on fire or something lol. Not like a pimple. Actually probably just like a herpes blister considering this is a variant of herpes. I have had people explain that to me and it just clicked they probably feel similar on the skin. The nerve damage is the bad part about shingles holy fuck do not wait. Med Valacyclovir 1GM Tablets 12 pill 2x a day for 5 days. This was my most recent script Info
4798,The shingles vaccine sucks.: A coworker of mine developed shingles last week. Even with getting to the doctor quickly and getting an antiviral she still had stabbing pain in her ear for a week and knows it could have been worse. Although the side effects of the vaccine seem to suck I Am not qualified to get it until I turn 50 later this year they seem less sucky than shingles for sure.
4799,neither work but 1 can kill you. MIL just came down with shingles despite being vaccinated.
4800,Suffering so much already with severe insomnia long COVID CFS . Now I get hit with shingles Did Not even know what it was till the rash started developing blisters its on my back shoulder blade area and patch on my spine and patch on my chest it feels like sun burn and prickly heat it is not severely painful though of what I Have read people have it like.. Luckily its not on my face Here in the uk I spoke to doctor today she said I Have probably gone over 72 hours for antivirals and it does not seem like its severe seen as I Have had it for a week already she said she can still prescribe them though Not sure if I should just wait it out? I react so bad even to antibiotics and any med causes such awful adrenaline insomnia nausea dizziness I do not know what to do Anyone been in this situation?
4801,I got shingles. My whole summer was ruined I am still feeling after effects could last months to rest of life. Get the vaccine folks. You will feel like shit for a couple days but the alternative is truly terrible.
4802,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Mine started very differently from a rash FYI everyone if a side of your face starts to hurt and swells up it can be shingles. The doctor examined me carefully and found a pinhead size lesion near my eye but it was almost invisible. It would likely have damaged my eye if I had not been super lucky to take the antiviral on time. Doc thinks I was less than 24h away from the antiviral not being able to help anymore. Any doubt RUN to a clinic.
4803,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Side note rehingles They suck. I got a fucking infection on my back and shoulder. Fucking crystals growing out of my skin. They hurt. Not like skin hurts like deep injury type nerve pain. get that shit early
4806,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: People go on about how awful the side effects are from the vaccines. I got the shots right before COVID started messed up timing on my second shot a bit but its fine and yeah the side effects were a bit rough for a day. But you know what really sucks? Shingles. I know people who have had it and it was awful to watch them go through it.
4809,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1965. Vaccinated before I could go to kindergarten for mumps measles and chicken pox. Caught all of them at school with other vaccinated children. And the vaccines did not lessen the symptoms. As an adult I have had shingles twice and I even get the shingles vaccine every year. I am not getting anymore vaccines. I no longer trust the CDC because they admit that they lied about the Covid vaccine slowing transmission of the disease. I am in no way an anti vaccine I just have lost faith after so many lies.
4812,Shingles after Shingrix: I know That is why I wanted to share my story since I am sure it was the vaccine that spared me all that pain. I am over 50 so my doctor prescribed it for me but they should let everyone get it. If my experience is at all common for people who get shingles after being vaccinated then there is no excuse for withholding it.
4816,41 and got Shingles: I tried to move a dresser at 38 felt my back pop and immediately broke out in itchy splotches. Went to the doctor and got the meds for it. Not fun.
4817,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Make sure you do get it when you are 50 I cannot stress this enough. My father passed away last month due to sepsis caused by shingles. I would have never guessed this was possible.
4820,"Turned the big 5-0 today and I have questions : Where are my jetpack, flying car, and hoverboard? Why do my joints hurt? What's the best remedy for a sore throat from yelling at all those kids to get off my lawn?"
4821,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got a kidney transplant when I was 36 and insurance would not cover the shingles vaccine before the surgery due to my age. Less than a year after my transplant I got shingles and now I Am immune suppressed and cannot get the vaccine. Stupid.
4823,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do remember the chicken pox parties. Me and my two brothers all got it at the same time. Youngest brother got vaccinatedlucky. I Have had shingles twice now. First time as a 22 year old in college second time in my late 30s when I also got Covid for the first time. That one was really fun. It was along my chest armpits and back. THE MOST INTENSE BACK PAIN FOR WEEKS. I did not sleep. I would get up in the night to rub my back on whatever I could find like a freaking bear in the woods. I wanted to get the vaccine and the doctor said I would have to pay out of pocket because I Am not old enough. This is BS. People my age had full exposure to chicken pox it makes zero sense.
4825,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I Have already had my two shots. I was fine both times with no issues. Some people it will knock them out. Some will have issues at the injection site. Some like me will not have any issues at all.
4826,After having chicken pox 3 times vaccinated my daughter got shingles at 18 years old She Is 33 now and has had several outbreaks which she described as the worst pain imaginable
4827,RSVImpfung sterreich: Wenn du das Geld hast dann mach es zum Schutz deines Kindes. RSV Infektionen haben eine weite Bandbreite vom einfachen Schnupfen bis zum Aufenthalt in der Intensivstation. Das ist ein Lotterie an der du nicht teilnehmen willst. Klare Impfempfehlung von meiner Seite. Meine Tochter hatte das Glck dieser Impfung leider nicht. War eine schlimme und dramatische Woche
4836,Okay so the last two weeks have sucked so bad... We loosened our restrictions in going out to public spaces and social stuff. Following county health department information Influenza Covid and RSV have been below threshold. We decided that we would try to get back to some normalcy. And yes I got vaccinated for all three of those as well. My husband started getting sick something in his sinuses. okay... well do our best... but well we live together so you know.. best efforts to prevent germ spreading failed. about 2 days following I started to feel similarly. First night had a fever woke up middle of the night full on body aches.. Is this flu? Took some IBP got into a bath... well how bad could it really get? Next day.. husband develops conjunctivitis and he is scheduled for Jury Duty that week... I am telling him we need to go to urgent care... I am getting a sore throat no major congestion just this very thin post nasal drip. inflammation in sinuses for sure. I am feeling pressure in my ears... IBP at least seems to help. We take home COVID test negative. Okay well I want to go to urgent care because I have an infusion scheduled that week and I do not know what to do if I am sick. So he finally relents and we go to urgent care and when there I tell them we are both being seen. We get seen.... he gets drops for his eyes because yeah it is gross and also a note from doc he is not going to jury duty because infectious. Doc looks at me... I tell her about the upcoming infusion... she says okay we will do an actual test for flu and covid for you but she tells us this is going around and tests are coming up negative and such so get the nasal swab they test... Get results next morning... both negative. Checks ears yup fluid in there but no signs of infection. Chest clear. Yup throat looks irritated. Lymph nodes swollen. For the most of the week yeah I feel like shit but overall I am functional. Maybe I got it easy? I call infusion clinic they move the appointment to the following week. Cool. I am still of course taking my Imuran and HCQ at home I am doing IBP... I am drinking tea with lemon and honey... gargling with salt water... all that jazz. Friday comes along and I AM HIT LIKE A FUCKING BRICK HOUSE no fever... but the most severe sore throat I have had in a long time... my throat is RED. I am of course worried about secondary infections but we do not see any striping or pustules to indicate as such. Just a whole lot of swelling. Alright time to add in some NyQuil Chloraseptic spray and sore throat drops. I AM MISERABLE. I am starting to bruise again... and here come the first time in my life I have ever had conjunctivitis. I get drops right away... Sunday... voice is gone.. I have laryngitis... I call back to infusion clinic and tell them I am still sick.. we push appointment again. They ask if I am being seen I say yes... it is viral... there is not much to be done other than get through it. Time to pick up throat coat tea get that slipper elm... the evenings are the worst.. I can manage during the day very minor symptoms but evening comes and it is a little rough. I start feeling exhausted... It is getting better.. the conjunctivitis has resolved I am on the last day of drops. throat is still sore but part of the problem is the irritation is giving me a dry cough... again I am not congested... there is nothing to cough up. I coughed so hard I lost my dinner last night. BUT have not coughed since then... got good sleep last night woke up feeling a bit better.. still sore throat but it is healing. I am pretty sure at this point it is post viral. I told my spouse last night I am super concerned that this has caused my platelets to drop again. yes I am taking the Imuran etc... but while these symptoms of this infection were not life threatening.. I think it really did a number on my immune system and fucked up any stability I had from treatment. I need to go get blood work done and I should probably get it done this week... I am somewhat apprehensions about it and I know I should not be because we should know where I am CBC wise but the anxiety of it just absolutely crushes me. I do not know why I have this emotional feeling like if my blood work comes back abnormal it is my fault. What prompted me to write all this out? I ate a few banana chips while making myself some tea... noticed a lump on the inside of my cheek... i did not notice it before now... went to check in the mirror and it is a blood blister... just another sign that my platelets may be low again. I do not know what this viral infection is going around but fuck it put me through the ringer for 2 weeks... I am hoping I can get my infusion next week as planned... also had to reschedule my thyroid biopsy as well. I really do not want to have to go back onto prednisone again.
4838,"Rashes on body after seeing girlfriend: You definitely need to go to your GP, as a start. They might refer you to dermatology. Does this only seem to happen after sleeping/laying in your girlfriend's bed? Ever had a sore on your penis that went away?"
4842,Has your infant received the RSV antibodies?: My baby got the RSV antibodies and hes doing great. The RSV antibody injection is not new. It seems new because they extended the age at which babies can receive it up to 8 months and therefore it got a new name as well Beyfortus. Data says beyfortus is about 90 effective in preventing infant hospitalization from RSV. I think your worry is entirely valid because you care about your baby and you do not want to harm them but I think in this case you did a logical and healthy thing by getting your baby these antibodies. Source
4843,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Yeah I know someone who has permanent neuropathy in their arms from it. Awful. I am going to get the shots. Just working through the anxiety.
4845,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: Ironic the vaccine temporarily weakened your immune system that caused the shingles to reactivate this occurs with covid vaccine too.
4847,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: So what kicked her ass to the ground the double vaccine or the boost. Maybe Jesus got tired of that joke and knocked her the fk out.
4851,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in 1991. I both got vaccinated for chicken pox and contracted it roughly 12 years after being vaccinated. No chicken pox party.
4852,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I went to a chicken pox party and got it a second time that same year. I also got shingles that manifested as liver pain for a couple weeks before presenting as a rash so I had no idea what the fuck was going on. 110 would not recommend to fellow Yelpers but they do get one star for free refills and all you eat.
4853,Shingles and other Vaccines: Keep an eye out for GuillainBarr with the shingles vaccine I have known two people now who have had that reaction triggered.
4855,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles at 37 and it was god awful. It was on my side along my bra line and under my breast. I did not think it was anything more than a rash until it started getting the crusty pustules and i could hardly walk. I was literally leaning on a shoping cart in the grocery store to hold myself up. I almost missed the window to start treatment for it. I was in my couch for 3 days afterwards on prescription pain meds because I could not walk. Get your vaccine as soon as you are able to.
4856,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 35 weeker got it the day he was discharged. Its different than a regular vaccine like others have said. I asked the NICU doc for a lot of info because I too was worried. She said its an injection of antibodies not a live virus. We had no issues and felt so much more at ease knowing if he did get it his little lungs would be okay. We did not have any issues after getting it. He was still discharged that day and came home with no issues. Good luck to your little one
4862,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not think its anybodys fault. Some people will get it and some people will not. I Have been exposed. I went to chickenpox parties more than once. I never got chickenpox. I Have gotten the vaccine multiple times. I never show any titers. I Have gotten the shingles vaccine I got a strong response hopefully I will not ever get shingles or chickenpox. I do not know if I have titers for shingles its possible I do not make them either. My sisterinlaw in who is mid 30s got shingles twice. Its a crap shoot.
4867,RSV Vaccine: I am also due March and live in Sydney. It is a new vaccine I think you can either get it when you are pregnant OR they give it to the baby post birth but it is some sort of antibody not an actual vaccine? Anyway the info I have been hearing is unclear about if baby can access it post birth so I just got it myself a few weeks ago at a GP in Brisbane. Its free in QLD but unclear when it will become free in NSW. I got it done at about 29 weeks and vaccine was fine with few if any noticeable side effects I mean I was tired and felt unwell the next day but that is also just pregnancy lol
4871,If she really had shingles why the fuck has not she had the loser meth head take her to a doctor or hospital for treatment then? Same thing with her autism.: I am not vouching for her but I just had shingles but I was on meds and no one around me got it. But I highly doubt she got shingles again this fast
4873,Shingles vaccine: I got it with COVID vaccine 1st one ok. booster with another COVID vaccine was not fun. no other COVID vaccine reactions but still much better than shingles
4878,Lichen planus? Hello everyone so I am here to see if anyone else has experience something similar to what has happened to me since i cannot find much information on it. By The Way I am seeing a dermatologist. I started on the 2.5mg for a month then went up to 5mg about 6 weeks in on 5mg around 1011 weeks total since starting MJ i started experiencing some burning sensation on some parts of my body almost like a sun burn. I also started experiencing more nerve pain on my back where i had shingles almost 8 years ago. The burning pain left but the nerve pain stay and that part of my body started becoming itchy as well. After all that next thing i can remember is was this tickling sensation on my lip thought i was getting a cold sore but i did not then i started getting the same sensation on my palms then the soles of my feet. Then my palms and soles started itching a lot Next thing i notice was i started getting these pink dots on my soles then this big oval pink spotrash on my palm. And after that it all went down hill. I started getting all types of different rashes bumps blisters all over my body. I honestly did not think it was from the shot. I thought at first i was getting bit by something then i thought it was eczema. I went to the urgent center which thought was hand foot and mouth. Fast forward went to a dermatologist at this point i was covered in these things they did two biopsies. And after 2 weeks it came back as a possible drug eruption. Doctor says it has to be the Mounjaro. And she called these spots or whatever they are Lichen. I googled and found lichen planus and some of the rashes do look very similar to it some do not. I was advice to stop MJ for now as they check me for some autoimmune diseases which came back high and positive. And i am currently on Prednisone for 10 days. I also have to follow up with my Endo. That was the one to prescribe it. Inam waiting for further testings and seeing what went wrong especially after 1011 weeks of already being on it. Also want to add that i ended up going up to 7.5mg beginning of December which probably made the situation worse. Now my question is has anyone experience anything similar to this? If so what did you do? What did the doctor do? What was the diagnosis if anything? the dermatologist said i might be able to try something else but if the blood work came back positive for an autoimmune disease i might not be able to do any of the injections. Which i am sad because my A1c is at the lowest it has been since I can remember and I Have also lost 30lbs since starting.
4880,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I have not gotten the shingles vaccine but I always get severe reactions to vaccines so I avoid them if possible.
4882,I just picked up a script at CVS was told I was due for RSV Shingles Flu Pneumonia Covid vaccine I said No Thanks Got the Shingles one got Shingles got flu one got flu Got pneumonia one got pneumonia never got the RSV or Covid vaccine never got RSV or Covid.
4883,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: No chickenpox party but I got it from my sister. Shingles at 32 after I attempted to get the vaccine at 30. I can only be thankful I only had two spots and not many symptoms. My friend who is younger than me had a horrible rash with the nerve pain
4888,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Your reaction to vaccinations in general should be your guide. I Am pretty lucky in that I very rarely have reactions so the shingles shots were not bad.
4892,Heads up that shingles shot may kick your ass for a day or two. Still better than getting shingles.
4895,Has anyone under 60 been able to receive the RSV vaccine?: I do not have any antibodies to the pneumonia vaccine. I was on antibiotics 8 times last year and there was a fear amongst my doctors that I was one infection away from something that could be antibiotics resistant. Since I got the RSV vaccine a year ago I have been diagnosed with subclass IGG deficiency. Edit It was approved by the FDA in October for those 1849.
4898,Shingles: I got shingles twice on biologics. I had to ask my rheumatologist to put in a request to get the vaccine because otherwise insurance would not cover it I am only 33 and you need to be 55 or something to get it without approval. Have not gotten it since I got the vaccine. You just need to tell your rheumatologist you want it .
4899,Shingles vaccine: The shingles vaccine is worse than flu or Covid however its nothing like getting the real thing. The pain is unbearable even from something as simple as getting brushed by a bed sheet or even a moderate gust of wind. I lost 100 hearing in one ear after my bout wshingles. Get the vaccine
4901,I am unvaccinated but when I hug some vaccinated people I break out in shingles the very next day.
4908,RSV Abrysvo vaccine QLD: I am paying 300 to get it in Victoria next week. I had RSV after my first was born and I thought I was going to die  have never been so sick in my life.
4913,2nd shot was even worse for me. But glad I did it. Know several people a bit older than me who have had shingles. DO NOT WANT.
4920,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I am a week in with shingles and did not have the vaccine. Our friend went into atrial fibrillation 24 hours after vaccination. I chose not to do it because of that.
4922,Questions about vaccinations.: Check with your doctor for sure. I have had two transplants and after 14 years my second one is losing functioning. I Am at stage 3a46. I just got my flu vaccine for the year and am about to get another Covid booster. I just got over my second bout of shingles and will be getting that vaccine soon. I Am up to date on pneumonia and tetanus.
4925,I Am a fit and healthy 54 yo woman. I do not take any medications and do not need to since I do not eat the Standard American diet. I never got the Covid vaccine but recently decided to get the shingles vaccine. Big mistake A month later and I Am lethargic and sick still. vaccines
4931,Shingles vaccine: yeah almost forgot about the fatigue.. I was just so glad when the painburning stopped. I took pain meds for a week for that and it barely helped.
4932,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got shingles on my god damned face this summer. It was BRUTAL. Too late for antivirals. Some people get PHN post herpetic neuralgia  longterm pain and yes you can get shingles more than one. It fucking SUCKED. Ended up in the ER because the headaches were so bad.
4936,41 and got Shingles: I got it at 37 I think. Definitely stress triggered. I got it pretty mild thankfully on my upper torso and it hurt like a bad sunburn or fresh tattoo. But still cannot get the vaccine until I Am 50
4938,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: I am in the UK and so wish we could get the RSV vaccine for our babies but it is not licensed here yet. I know how you feel though I am very provaccine and our LO will have the BCG next week and I am freaking out a bit.
4940,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: Oh my That Is awful I Have done so much research since I got shingles and so many people even young people are dealing with horrible symptoms Why are we as a community not talking about this more?? Its almost like there is a stigma issue or something. When I bring it up most people seem uncomfortable? Oh well I Am telling my story if even one person listens then its worth it Hope you get better soon
4942,Shingles shot Ack: Glad you got the shot though My husband got shingles he almost lost an eye It was brutal. Nothing knocks that dude down but man shingles did
4943,: yup happened to my 41 yr old nephew. clots to heart and lungs heart stopped 5 x on the way to the hospital. death certificate natural causes mandated vaccine we will never forgive or forget. myself and 3 children never fell for this BS. thank you for all you do
4946,Shingles vaccine: My first vaccine was much worse than my second.
4948,Shingles and other Vaccines: I do not usually react much but shingles was rough for me.
4949,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Same. I got shingles and months of fighting staph infections. I think it had to do with vaccines but what do I know.
4951,Just got the HPV vaccine and feeling a bit off. Has anyone else had any side effects after getting this vaccine? How long did they last for you?
4952,Shingles vaccine: You should be able to get the shot your insurance probably just will not cover it source used to work at a clinic We used to just make people under 50 sign a waiver that they understood they would be billed for it. Maybe do some more checking around if you are really interested in it. I had it once and my case was super mild so I lucked out. I have an autoimmune disease and my dr signed off that I should have it so I was able to get my shot covered.
4957,Shingles after Shingrix: I had shingles when I was 35. Took antiviral meds it cleared up. No lasting pain. This is typical for younger people who get shingles there is a small spike in shingles cases at the late 20s to mid 30s age range. I Am over 50 now and just got the vaccine because I Am at the age where there is a significant change of longterm neuropathy that can be debilitating. You should chill and wait until your 50 for the vaccine.
4960,33 year old female. I thought I could have WHIM Syndrome Warts hypogammaglobulinemia immunodeficiency myelokathexis but I do not have neutropenia. I have been immunocompromised since childhood and am looking for anyone who can help diagnose me. Viruses I got chicken pox Varicella Zoster Virus when I was 4 and got VERY sick. My siblings got it at the same time and only had a few spots. My mom said I had thousands and had to see a doctor. My dad got chicken pox twice the second time as an adult and almost died. When I was 11 I got shingles on my back. I got diagnosed with severe warts Human Papilloma Virus on my hands and feet when I was 12 numerous on every finger have not been able to get rid of them for over 20 years. I was vaccinated against Hepatitis B as scheduled but when my antibody titres came back it said my body did not respond to the vaccine and I would need to be vaccinated again. I had Rubella German Measles Virus despite being vaccinated against it. I always get the COVID and flu vaccines but still get them both whenever they circulate. I have had confirmed cases of Norovirus Norwalk on several occasions as well as numerous gastrointestinal viruses. ParasiticFungalBacterial Infections I contracted Ascaris lumbricoides a parasitic round worm infection after traveling in SE Asia. No other person in my group was infected as far as I know. I developed Clostridium Difficile after antibiotics in my 20s. Had numerous cases of athletes foot and a bacterial infection called pitted keratolysis to my feet. Developed impetigo as an adult as well. I have clubbing on several of my fingernails. I work in medicine am from a middle class family and my hygiene is great. So I really think my immune system is not fully functioning. Please someone help me
4961,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I got shingles in 2010 after chemo for breast cancer. It was on the left side of my back and around to the front of my torso. Pure hell. I got the vaccine a year ago.
4962,Shingles vaccine experience: I highly recommend thinking about which shoulder to get the shot in but definitely get both the first and second doses of the shingles vaccine. Do Not be a dummy like me and at a single visit get both the shingles and Covid booster in the same arm that you sleep on. That was a very long sleepless and achy night Still better than getting shingles.
4963,Sleeping with shingles: My pain has been not near as bad the last few days. I am 2 weeks in tomorrow with the blisters. they have mostly dried up and scabbed over. Does the nerve pain come back or linger around ?
4970,I just got my results and it says I have HPV 59: Thank you so much for this I already had 2 shots in my home country and now I Am planning to get the 3rd one here. I really hope this goes away coz its driving me crazy
4975,I Am 45F and about a week in with shingles breaking out around my hipbuttabdomen and I want to die. I Am used to being in some pain most days shot through the hand 8 years ago but this is unbearable. I Have never had shingles nor been around anyone who has. I tried to get up and go to work this morning but without the pain meds I could barely get out of bed. Is this normal? I cannot afford to keep missing work but I do not think I can push through the pain without the meds. This is hell.
4977,Shingles vaccine: I rarely have any reaction to vaccinations other than a little soreness at the injection site. Even so I do not get a vaccination if I have something significant planned the next day. Given your history of reactions I suggest avoiding disruption on Thanksgiving by getting the shot on Friday. That gives you a solid two days so that if you are still feeling off when you go back to work it may be at the tail end of that reaction. Just my 2.
4979,This is FICTION not fact: I have had a few mild outbreaks of shingles. Since the vaccine only one. Since the second improved vaccine NONE.
4981,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Or if you have a compromised immune system.
4983,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I got shingles last year. On my SCALP Seriously. The pain The blisters started going down my head until I got one in my eyebrow. I now have a small patch of possibly permanent alopecia a little circular bald spot asymmetrically at the front of my hairline I know you already know I know everyone says it. But seriously. Go get your jabs
4986,Shingles vaccine: My arm was hella sore after but I remember watching my grandma suffer with shingles. No regrets here.
4987,I had shingles I suspect after a asymptomatic Covid my father also had shingles. Just got vaccinated for shingles just in case. My shingles was not to bad. My father the worse.
4997,: Wow this is becoming very real as I am a very fit 36 year old fully vaccine job required it and I have been experiencing heart and chest pain for a while now. Never had anything like it before.
5008,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I have had both the big ones but only once have I had both at the same time. And then there is tetanus. That one has a huge reputation to be one of the worst for arm pain and I had none. Covid shots not all of them have given me the worst arm pain. But all of those were way better than the illness
5010,I felt worse after the shingles vaccine than any I have ever taken...but from what I have been told from people who have had shingles the vaccine is well worth it.
5012,41 and got Shingles: What? I am 43 and I got it same time I got my first COVID shot. I still got Shingles but apparently they were not too bad because other people's descriptions sound awful. ETA just found out I could get it because I am immune compromised.
5014,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles and it was the worst nerve pain I ever had. An 8 out of 10 for several weeks. I had to wait a year to get the vaccine because my case was so severe. No issues with the vaccine except the sore arm. My suggestion is to get 3 lb weights and use them after the vaccine. It helped me a lot. I used them for about an hour after the second vaccine and did not have any pain. Do not get the vaccine with any others. More side effects are possible.
5015,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I thought if you get the chickenpox vaccine as a child preventing a case of chickenpox that you will never get shingles yep exactly but my understanding is that with kids now getting the chickenpox vaccine adults are not getting those little micro boosts in natural immunity so younger adults are getting shingles now. It used to be mainly older people but it is rising dramatically for those of us in our 30s and 40s who are too old to have gotten the chickenpox vaccine and old enough that the natural immunity is starting to wane. I have no idea why I got the shingles I actually thought it was a rash from my bathing suit from being in a hot tub a day previous although there was nothing visible but it felt like I would gotten a mild burn or something. I said to myself it almost feels like nerve pain and that set off the lightbulb. Yes there are antivirals you can get that will reduce the symptoms the earlier you take them and you can get them prescribed by a pharmacist I did this and my symptoms were mild enough that it did not affect my daytoday life more than a sunburn would. Funnily my dad had shingles at the same age 33. I am in Canada so the vaccine I assume would be free but I do not believe it is approved for people under a certain age edit unless you are immune compromised which I am. But I have a new doctor now so maybe I will pester him about it.
5017,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: I have not had the vaccine yet. But I have had shingles. Mine was a very small area on my nose. But if your side effects are typical for the vaccine I would take them any day over actual shingles. It was bad and I cannot even imagine how bad a typical case with much larger distribution would be.
5019,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles last year at 36 and did not catch it early enough. Had it on half of my face and it was hell. I Am all cleared up and have no scars but I have permanent nerve damage. I cannot feel half my forehead down to the tip of my nose and it itches like hell still a year later everyday. I asked about the vaccine and they would not allow me to have it under 50.
5020,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep same thing happened to me a couple years ago. Went to a couple chickenpox parties in my youth but never had a breakout. Was at my parents place a couple summers ago and after a day swimming in the lake had a severe itch on my stomach as we drive home the next day I started to get an itch on my back in the same spot as the front. By the third day it felt like an arrow through my torso went to the urgent care and the doc immediately diagnosed it as shingles. Its really awful and mine was not even severe I can hardly imagine how painful a full blown breakout of shingles would be.
5021,Shingles Is NO Joke: I also had it on my face doc told me if it had gone an inch further towards my eye nerves I could have gone blind. Pain is unreal from it.
5022,Could be an mcas rxn allergy to one of the nova ingredients perhaps? I Am precovid mecfs ok with nova but cannot take any more mRNA in PEM for 10 then 17 then 26 days the 3 I Have had. And permanent decline after Shingrix. Its a mess.
5023,THE 39TRIPLEDEMIC39... Should Parents be Worried? RSVFluCovid Dr. Paul Retired Pediatrician: We got influenza A in the New Year and it was bust. Fevers up to 105 body aches fatigue weakness the whole drill. I kept praying and mediating imaginingdirecting my white blood cells to kill the flu virus. Luckily for me I got over the worst of it after 2 days I told my husband that I felt like my body had been in a huge fight. I have never felt that way before even after COVID and I am 39. It was bizarre to feel the aftermath of my body taking care of the illness. I was in awe and so proud of my immune system lol
5024,Got vaccinated last year with the correctly timed booster. Thought I was in the clear. Every 6 to 22 seconds I am reminded that vaccines do not always work. Update Got a dr's appointment for this morning in about an hour. We will see if I can get any relief today. Update 2 Valacyclovir 1gm tablets  huge horse pills 3 per day PredniSONE 10mg tablets course  6 on day 1 5 on day 2 etc... She told me the pain can start 25 days before the rash shows up. Hopefully we can stop it before it starts.
5035,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: I cannot imagine I had shingles across my back and chest and my nipple and areola hurt for months and were sore for about two years after. Nerve damage can be a real lingering problem with shingles. I hope you are better soon.
5037,Shingles vaccine: Yep. I got tetanus from the tetanus shot. Its a live vaccine.
5045,I 100 agree with Rustad I regret getting the shots even if our unelected Premiere who represents 0 of the population of BECAUSE disagrees. 4 people with shingles 2 with myocarditis 1 with Guillain barre syndrome. New class action suite in the USA against Pfizer covid 19 vaccine
5046,Has the chicken pox or shingles vaccine helped anyone for cold sores?: Are you sure they are coldsores then? Does Not sound like cold sores. I recently had perioral dermatitis.. maybe you have that going on? Little red bumps that come and go around the mouth and bottom half of your face. I highly suggest making an appt with a dermatologist and talking to them about all of this
5047,I took two days off work in anticipation of being out of commission after getting my second shingles vaccine. Well I was administered my second shot yesterday morning aaaand ....nothing....bupkus....zero....zilch....nada. do not get me wrong it is nice having a super long weekend but I feel let down that I have no side effects. I was not really looking forward to feeling like crap but after the months long build up it is kind of a let down. It makes no sense to me either I know.
5056,Shingles vaccine: Wait til after the holiday. My arm hurt a lot all the way into my neck. I felt cruddy tooo
5058,Shingles Vaccine: Most people I have known feel bad for 12 days after getting the vaccine but then go back to normal. Shingles is WAY worse. Pain can last months and I worked in ophthalmology and saw many people have horrible experiences with it in their eye and on their face.
5059,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: It can help to look away during blood draws. I did not used to think I had a problem watching them but then nearly fell over after one.
5062,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got my first shingles vaccine dose and a flu shot at the same time and that night I thought I was going to die. Now I Am really glad I got those shots but wow. Do Not be like me. Space that shit out.
5064,High Grade Anal Dysplasia in Men: I did not have any symptoms at all. I knew that I was vaccinated with Gardasil but my doctor recommended me to get a anal papsmear i had never had one before and I had tested positive for High Risk HR HPV. I knew the strain that I have is not the big cancer causing ones but my doctor told me to give it 6 months retest and it will go away as most people clear it no problem. So I naturally researched everything that I could about HPV and had both a oral penile and anal exam aka anoscopy. And that is how I found out about my dysplasia. If you never participated in receptive anal sex like I have your risk of exposure to the virus in your anus is low. Getting an anal papsmear is considered routine so I would start with an anal papsmear to see if you have HPV. If you are truly worried about it then you can go see a colorectal doctor and they can perform exams to ease any anxiety around your condition.
5066,Shingles vaccine experience: Perhaps you are correct about some. But the ONLY time I Have ever had the flu was right after I got a flu shot when I was in my 30s. And I got sick a lot that year. Have Not had one since and practically never get sick. I Am seriously considering the shingles vaccine but all these vaccines the pharmaceutical companies are pushing are questionable. RSV Pertussis etc. I just do not believe they are necessary.
5068,At least its not the shingles shotthat kicked my butt.
5078,Booster issues in vascular surgery: I worked with a jabbed guy who just had covid a week later me an unjabbed developed shingles .
5081,I got the shingles vaccine and warning the side effects are severe.: Same i never had any side effects to any vaccine. I feel the same and very surprised.
5082,I Am sorry you are having a rough time. I did not have any reaction at all to it. Or the Covid shots. I had the shingles Covid booster shot at the same time.
5084,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did not go to one but got Chicken Pox twice First time was bad 2nd time I was 9 and not as bad. Doctors were surprised I had it again after having it so bad at 5. At 13 or 14 I was diagnosed with shingles I had it on my back. I Am 43 now I remember the doctor asking me what I was stressed aboutidk if that is how they thought you got it or what. I looked at him and said I Am in middle school I Am literally stressed about everything I never want that again. They also said I was one of the youngest they had seen with shingles and even had 2 other doctors in office come in to diagnose without giving there opinion.
5085,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My lovely friend who is in her mid40s has had it THREE times. Last bout was a couple of years ago and it was so bad she was on gabapentin for months and could not sleep. She Is not even old enough to get the vaccine. GET YOUR VACCINE you do not want this shit. She was in so much pain poor thing.
5094,In Ohio too Meyer Grocery pharmacist gave my 88 yr old father CV booster Flu shot shingles shot all at same time. He died win 3 months.
5100,Hi all I am about to get my shingrix and I started to wonder whether the celebrex i take will interfere with it. My rheum refused to speak to me at all about vaccines punting to primary care. My primary care doctor did not mention anything but when I look online it says to avoid taking ibprofen and other cox2 inhibitors for some days before and a week after. Have you guys gotten advice from your rheum about whether to pause antiinflammatory meds like this before and after? I know it is always a balance with patients like us because so much is contraindicated. My rheum is not answering any messages over the last 2 weeks but it feels important to get this right. I got the Hep B vaccine last week and had zero effects and the flu the week before and also zero effects which is actually not a good sign as far as I have understood it. This is all unusual for me so I am wondering if the Celebrex has wiped out my immune response to vaccines. Thanks so much for your input
5101,Shingles vaccine: I Am one of those unusual people who get shingles repeatedly anywhere along the nerve that runs from my chest to my ear generally two times a year. Never a big spot but painful as hell. My right side will be inflamed from breast to top of scalp with just a few inch spot of eruption. More than the pain is the exhaustion. I received my first Shingrix series 1.5 years ago. No issues whatsoever. The are still tingles when I Am under stress but no eruption. Ill take it.
5103,Shingles Shot 2: Yeah that one's sort of rough and caused me a bit of aggravation too. I actually never got the second dose though as I was in a hurry to start a DMT and it was going to push that off further. Hopefully one will be enough... Good that you got the full amount though. If it is legal maybe try a balanced cannabis strain that really helps with the soreness but it is probably going to make you more tired so...
5104,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I am researching additional risk factors and came across this fantastic interview. Also when I got shingles 16 days ago I suddenly had a dental emergency and had an old root canal completely removed a few days ago. So now I have a deep painful dental procedure trying to heal and am trying to heal from shingles Apparently there is a correlation with toxic dental procedures and other health issues like herpes zoster virus getting activated and other immune disorders. I feel overwhelmed by both issues happening BUT very lucky to get that old root canal out of my mouth. It traps bacteria way up in your gums and tissues and there is no way for it to drain out. I suspect my health with improve now that the old 15 yr root canal which had an infection per the dentist was cleaned out. More to
5105,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: You can hear her breath being really labored.
5106,I have had sores since last Saturday. And I had an infection in my ear on Monday put in antibiotics. Been a week and the ear still hurts. Started antivirals Thursday. I hang intense tooth pain in my bottom left teeth in the side where the rash is. Since three days ago my neck and been swollen on my left side and my neck has been hurting since Friday. Burning and hot to the touch. I called my dr and all he did was RX gabapentin. Anyone else experience this?
5112,My dad got shingles at 75 during covid sadly he ended up with permanent nerve damage. Get the vaccine
5114,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Who else loves that Trish got the Shingles? I have had them... they can hurt like a MF... mine did....
5117,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Yup. My brother and I both had it as teens in the mid'90s because my mom was too anxious to ever expose us to it. I know she meant well but we both got terribly sick me especially because I was a bit older he was 13 and I was 16 and I was nearly hospitalized from it. However now that there is a vaccine there is really no excuse for that behavior. Even small children can suffer complications from it and it opens up the possibility of getting shingles later in life.
5118,I got a debuff I thought only affected higher level players: I got with it at 25 and got stupidly lucky. I had a blocked ear canal at the same time. When I woke up unable to hear out of one side and that side of my face going numb I went to the ER. They cleaned out my ear but had no explanation for my facial numbness. The doctor left came back looked around a bit to determine that it was localized to one facial nerve and then diagnosed me with shingles. They put me on meds and I never got the rash. I have read that shingles is happening more often and younger because adults are not being exposed to children with chicken pox. Apparently being exposed to kids who are infected acts like a booster to our natural immunity and people getting it after 50 coincided closely with when their natural immunity dropped off after their own kids went through chicken pox. Now that most kids are vaccinated adults are not getting out immunity refreshed and are getting singles earlier. Personally if I have to get a single vaccine every so many years I am okay with that if it also means kids are not getting the infection at all.
5119,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I am a late Gen X closer to millennial really but weirdly I got shingles in my 20 s. it was hard to diagnose at the time bc I did not fit the profile for shingles. Literally air passing over my skin caused me searing excruciating agonizing pain. It was one of the worst things I have ever experienced. I might try to get a preventative shot now because I never want to ever have shingles again.
5125,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Personally, I'm unsure what to do. I've had the 'vid three times. First time hit like a truck, but the following times, it was just an annoyance. I've also had 3 jabs for it. Following all this, I developed tinnitus, a constant blocked nose, difficulty breathing, an increase in floaters in both eyes, and tiredness. It's been suggested that it's long covid, but some reports have said it could be resulting in the Pfizer jabs. I'm just not sure what to do this time."
5130,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: F'real Another friend in his 30s also experienced something similar rash all around his back and waist went in and got officially diagnosed with shingles. Also 'rona induced we think. I do remember it feeling kind of itchy too now that you say that.
5131,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Only been a few months since I Have had them but still have pain in the areas affected. Numbness in my hand as well and a clicking type noise in my neck and head.
5132,When should I take my first dose?: i take mine late friday night before bed. that way if i have issues i have my weekend to recover. i have really only had a problem with extreme fatigue when increasing my dose no nausea etc but i was REALLY glad to not have to work those days
5133,Shingles again?: Yes its because the Zoster virus travels down your nervous system to a dermatone and can inflame the tissue around the nerve along its path of travel. Its that inflamed tissue that presses on the nerve it can happen in multiple places like in my case giving me migrating pain all over my lower back and it also inflamed my sciatic nerve down both legs. It was horrible i could barely walk at times. Its very important to keep viral load low to avoid that hence why I always have antivirals on hand.
5134,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I Am fully vaccinated and still got shingles lol. Yes your mother is lame for being anti vaccine but like shingles is not her fault.
5141,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Fractured skull and a concussion but she is okay now
5144,I had a 2 shot treatment. Arm was more sore around the injection area I think it goes deeper? But no side adverse side affects at all. Had shingles as well around the waist prior to this. Yes you can get it multiple times without the vaccine. Get the shingles vaccine.
5145,I do not think I am really seeking medical advice here. I trust my primary care physician and the process I am going through. It is more that my mind is running wild with worry and anxiety and typing this out and having a potential discussion will hopefully ease it up a bit. It started the evening of May 6 when my wife found what she thought was an ingrown hair on my back and I developed a terrible migraine that lasted throughout the following day. I had been fishing in the weeds a few days beforehand so when it started to spread on my lower back we assumed it was a spider bite. The bumps continued to spread a bit over about a 4 cm area and blister up with pus. By May 14 I was starting to have some back pain as well as pain in my arm pit. May 17th I went to urgent care and got a weak antibiotic for a brown recluse spider bite. Things continued downhill from there. By May 19 my back pain was severe and debilitating. I also noticed a lump forming in my arm pit. I messaged my primary care physician and saw one of her PAs the following day May 20. She put me on 160g sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim which wiped me out for an entire week. She also gave me Meloxicam for my back saying that the pain was too severe to be related to the bite so I must have bulging discs. I continued messaging with my primary care physician. By May 28 the bite on my back was finally scabbing up and looking much better. The back pain was gone and after I finished the antibiotics I felt completely better. The swelling in my arm pit was still there but they said to give it a few weeks to go down and that the lingering swelling was normal. June 1 the swelling in my arm pit continued to grow and was alarming enough that you could now see the lump visually. My primary physician got me in Monday June 3 since the lump should not be continuing to grow. By then it was about 9 cm in diameter and she ordered an ultrasound as soon as they could get me in. She also looked at all the photos of the bite went over all the details of how everything progressed and said that it was the shingles not a spider bite. I had the sonogram yesterday June 4 in the afternoon. I was told that they were way behind and not to expect results until June 6 but hopefully they would get me in late June 5. Within two hours my doctor had my results and the mass was multiple severely swollen lymph nodes. She said that this was almost assuredly an infection because of the timing in relation to the shingles. She got the results at 445 and had me rush in to get a shot of Rocephin in order to be aggressive with it. It is been 17 hours since that shot and the mass is not reducing at all. I have a followup appointment for her to look at it again on June 11. The nurse that gave me the shot said that Rocephin is very strong and many people have almost an immediate response to it. The mass is still 9 cm. wide. My wife marked the outline and it has not reduced at all. I know if it remains this size I will have to get it biopsied after my next appointment. Every minute that goes by without it shrinking is exponentially growing my anxiety. I am guessing there is a reason my followup is not until the 11th... but my family history mixed with the knowledge that I have the BRCA gene has me going crazy. I do think it is a positive sign that the mass is very tender and painful. From everything I have read that also point to this being an infection. Like I said I am not necessarily looking for advice or anything like that. Just trying to ease my mind... so thank you for reading if you are still here . tldr diagnosed with spider bite then spider bite with bulging disc then shingles. This followed with multiple lymph nodes going crazy and enlarging to a lump 9 cm. in diameter in my arm pit. Mind going crazy because of family history and fact that I have the BRCA gene.
5147,I just had the Flu and covid 2 days ago. I had the Shingles shot with them last year. The Shingles was the worst both the first and second.
5149,"Pro vaxx FANATIC spreads fear and vaccine misinformation in a recent debate - Dr. Reiwertz claimed that wild chickenpox kills 1/100 people!! - Here are the real facts: <url> ""In our recent debate, Dr. Reiwertz claimed that wild chickenpox kills 1/100 people. Here are the facts: chickenpox presents as a mild rash and slight fever and confers lifetime immunity to chickenpox and significant protection against shingles, heart disease, atopic diseases, and cancers including glioma, brain, and spinal tumors. Before Merck introduced the vaccine, 4 million people contracted chickenpox annually with 100 deaths, a mortality rate of 1/40,000 (not 1/100). Half the deaths were in adults who missed the infection in childhood. According to CDC, chickenpox in adults has 20x the risk of death and 10-15 times risk of hospitalization as in children. Merck's vaccine and booster cost $100 each. The total cost to theoretically save 50 children is approximately $900 million dollars or $17.5 million per life saved. For reference, HHS pegs the maximum compensable value of a child's life at $250,000 in Vaccine Court. Merck's vaccine is only 60% effective after 5 years, leaving adults vulnerable to shingles. Chickenpox can reactivate as shingles when an adult's immunity wanes or is not boosted by periodic exposure to children with chickenpox. CDCs clinical studies predicted that widespread vaccination would double shingles rates among adults and children and precipitate a shingles epidemic. Shingles is twice as deadly as chickenpox and can also cause debilitating pain and blindness. CDC's lead researcher during that 8-year study, Dr. Gary Goldman, charges that CDC ordered him to falsify the science and hide the shingles evidence. CDC Director Julie Gerberding led the shingles coverup and continued CDC's 1996 recommendation that every child get a chickenpox vaccine. (England and 17 other European nations refused to recommend the vaccine knowing it would cause a shingles epidemic). Merck rewarded Gerberding for this billion-dollar gift by naming her as president of its vaccine division. Merck's reaction to the shingles epidemic it created was to market a new shingles vaccine. Zostavax is linked to a long list of gruesome side effects including severe brain inflammation, blood disorders, shock, autoimmune diseases, and death."""
5153,shingles??: I had it in my mid30s. I was off 2 or 3 days from work but probably should have been off longer as I was so drained. I took the antivirals and tried to get as much rest as possible. It took ages for the rash to fully clear. I hope you are feeling better soon
5158,Despite setting up rules they kissed my 2 week old on his cheeks. I am super scared now. What signs should I look for in case my baby develops any infection? Also how soon would it start showing up? He has taken the rsv vaccine.
5159,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: There is a treatment that helps with PHN. It is Botox injections. Helped me reduce the pain immediately I encourage everyone to try. My doctor said it helps significantly in 80 percent of the time.
5160,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I had chickenpox when I was around 12 years old and expect to get shingles later in life like everyone else who had chickenpox as a child. Do Not blame anyone else for that.
5161,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I cannot even imagine. My cousin got shingles at 16. She laid on the couch and cried basically because it hurt so bad. A family friend had it in his eye he was older typical shingles age range. The eye
5162,Got my Shingles vaccine: Seriously folks. You do not want shingles. Its like radioactive chickenpox with electrical shocks that shoot down your legs. Almost killed my mom. Literally.
5166,Shingles flare?: I had less MS symptoms but my case of shingles was one of the worst my doctor had seen. I figured my immune system was too busy dealing with the wildfire happening on my healthy side to mess with my MS side.
5168,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: No I have not been approved to get the vaccine. Five and a half years ago at age 39 I got the shingles so bad it put me in the hospital for a week. It was on my face and affected my eye causing permanent damage to my eye. It will regularly become painful and the vision is cloudy to the point that I frequently cannot read anything if I try just using the one eye. It was bad but I still have not got a Dr to approve the vaccine. Eye shingles was horrifying and one of the most painful things I have ever experienced would not wish it on my worst enemy.
5172,A guy who works for me went and got his shingles vaccine two weeks later has shingles
5174,"Adult Varicella Vaccination and possibility of transmission to 1 year old infant....: When I was pregnant with my daughter a blood test showed that, despite having a severe case as a child, I had no immunity to Chicken pox. I was told to get vaccinated after giving birth. My daughter is now 13 months old, and I was headed to a new doctor in our new town the other day to set up being a patient and as a general check-up and forgot to mention it until I was sitting in the exam room when I remembered and explained. They administered the vaccine and told me to return in a month for the follow up. I now have redness, swelling, and itchiness on the injection site (I'm 4 days post-injection). I was warned that if a rash develops (I'm assuming a mild rash is causing the itchiness) that there is a slight chance of infecting someone with Chicken pox. My husband had them as a kid and my son has been vaccinated. My 13 month old, however, has not yet had Varivax - I should have checked before getting the vaccination for myself. The doctor I started taking her to in our new town apparently doesn't administer Varviax (or MMR vaccine) until an infant is 15 months old. I've looked all over to try to find out how paranoid I have to be about infecting her with my stupid spur of the moment vaccine injection site, but I'm having a hard time finding anything and her doctor isn't open until Monday morning. Can anyone provide me with information about whether I should be concerned? (I have wrapped the site in light gauze and am wearing a shirt over it). **Tl;Dr I got the adult vaccination for Varicella (Chicken pox) and the injection site is red, inflamed and itchy. My 13 month old hasn't been vaccinated for it yet. How concerned should I be about getting her sick and how do I prevent it?**"
5177,Shingles vaccine: It was fine. After the first shot no side effects. After the second I ran a slight fever and fell asleep early. Woke up totally fine. It is been 5 years and no shingles so far.
5181,Do Not you mean shingles from the fact your immune system fcked aids from the covid vaccine
5186,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I am 43 just got diagnosed with Shingles a few days ago. It seems to be a mild case but is causing severe ear pain as the rash is on my neck. I will get the vaccine as soon as I am able but I have not asked about it yet.
5187,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: Thanks for the information. It kind of gives me an idea of what to expect and not freak out if that second dose kicks my ass a bit.
5188,My MIL is still recovering from shingles 6wks after her symptoms began. She would not had the vaccine. I am getting that shot as soon as I qualify
5194,No. I am sorry but no. Personally I did drivethru for my first two. Also shingles activation is one of the very few vaccine side effects that at least a couple years ago are documented as slightly more likely than from the disease.
5195,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yup my friends face is wrecked from shingles
5197,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not recall that being a thing where I was but I certainly got chicken pox when I was around 7 and it was so miserable it remains very vivid. I was rubbing my body on anything wriggling like a worm on the ground rubbing against walls and trees like a bear it was insane. And the oatmeal baths did not help long and I was covered in pink calamine lotion. A couple years later I had a super bad reaction to poison Ivyoak or sumac and had it all over my body inbetween fingers and toes and that was just as bad. I Am terrified of shingles.
5201,"Shingles 2nd vaccine side effects update: Sharing my experience after getting my second shingles vaccine. I'm a healthy 50s female who had mild flu-like symptoms after the first dose. But this time around, it's a different story. Dealing with joint pain, headache, muscle aches, and feeling incredibly tired. Took my temperature and it's 101.5. I've taken ibuprofen and following the usual rest and hydration advice. Any tips on managing these side effects? And when should I seek medical help? Your insights would be helpful. Thank you!"
5203,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Me too. My mom got it along the top of her rib cage when she was in her early 50s. She had pain there the rest of her life and could never comfortably wear a bra again. So I scurried right over to my doctor to get the vaccine as soon as I turned 50. The second shot kind of sucked but I guarantee you it sucked a hell of a lot less than being in pain the rest of my life.
5205,Vaccine Schedule: The red hair thing is wild. My husband and his 3 brothers are red heads as well as both their parents. Not a single one of them has ever reacted to a vaccine and has no allergies I am not so lucky So the first 3 rounds 246 months of vaccines are the same shots. I had a reaction to some of them more than once so I just mentioned it to our pediatrician and we intentionally isolated that shot and did it 2 weeks after the initial set for my son. No reaction so we were back on track to do the regular vaccine schedule afterward. If they do not react the first time odds are they will not react to the next. Any time we do a new vaccine so not just a booster we isolate it. My pediatrician is very accommodating about it Especially because its from a medicalgenetichereditary standpoint and we want to make sure baby is fine. It is just a lot more office visits but I do not mind. The MMR is the only one they have basically said it will likely suck no matter what we do but I did not ever react to that one so its probably going to be fine.

5216,I am not The OOP is youmilchickenpox Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal. TRIGGER WARNING emotional manipulation spousal neglect child abuse abusive behavior child endangerment Original Dec 29 2015 I can hardly type this out because thinking about it makes me so angry. Earlier this year my husband 31M and I decided to spend Christmas with his family for the first time since my daughter was born last September. Since they live 12 hours away we decided to stay for a few weeks before Christmas so they could spend loads of time with Annie 13 months. We arrived early like we planned and everything was great. I have had a few disagreements with my motherinlaw Trish 56F in the past over my parenting style she criticised me for using disposable diapers buying baby food from the supermarket and not raising Annie as an organic baby but everything seemed great. After a day or two settling in my husband and I decided to pick up a few gifts from a mall around an hour away before the lastminute rush kicked in. My fatherinlaw 60M tagged along. Trish said she was happy to take care of Annie. We got back a few hours later and Annie was down for a nap on a blanket I did not recognise. Trish said one of her friends dropped by and gave it as an early Christmas gift. It looked pretty oldworn but I figured one of her hippy friends was just recycling it. The next two weeks were fine aside from Trish making a point to prepare meals for Annie from scratch. I mentioned this to my husband and he said to just let her be. Annie mostly mushed the food Trish gave her with her handsthrew the bowls on the floor as she is been doing at the moment. Trish said it would take her a while to get used to nutritious meals. I was getting sick of her meddling but it was only for a few weeks so for the sake of the holidays I let it slide. The day after Christmas Annie was really unsettled and would not stop fidgeting and crying. I took her temperature and she had a fever so I kept an eye on her for the next few days and it thankfully started to go down. This morning she started to get a rash and blisters on her arms and legs and I freaked out. I was packing a bag to drive to see a doctor when Trish asked where I was going. I told her Annie had a rash and I was taking her to see a doctor. She got a weird smug smile on her face and told me there was nothing to worry about. When I asked her what she was talking about she said without even looking at Annie that what she had was just Chickenpox. I asked her how she could possibly know that and she casually admitted one of her friend's grandkids had chickenpox a few weeks ago so she asked them to wipe a blanket over the child's arms legs and face and bring it to her house. At this point I could not believe what I was hearing so I asked if that blanket was the gift Annie was sleeping on. She said it was. I lost my shit. To be honest I do not really remember what I said because I was up most of the night for two days checking on Annie. I just unleashed on Trish asking what the fuck was wrong with her. My husband and fatherinlaw came to try to calm things down and Trish dug in her heels and said chickenpox was the best and most natural thing for Annie to build up her immunity. I already have a vaccination schedule in place with my paediatrician and she was booked in to get immunised for chickenpox at 18 months. We drove to see the doctor and he confirmed she had it. He said I will have to cut Annie's nails short and might have to tape socks on her hands while she sleeps because kids so young can scratch until they bleed and that will leave scars. On the drive back my husband started making excuses for Trish that she was only doing what she thought was best. I could not believe he was defending her and we fought most of the way home until I told him to stop talking to me. Annie's been scratching like crazy and I just had to tape socks over her hands. Trish tried to talk to me when we got back and I told her to get out of my sight. We were meant to stay until Wednesday but I just finished packing up our stuff so we can leave first thing in the morning. I am so angry I cannot even think. Whenever I hear Trish moving around in the kitchen my heart starts beating faster and I feel like going out there and grabbing her by the hair. I do not ever want to see her again or let my daughter see her again. What can I say to make her and my husband realise the enormity of what she is done? I do not think I can speak coherently to their faces until Annie gets better. tldr Motherinlaw deliberately infected my daughter with chickenpox. I am so angry I feel like physically harming her. I need advice on what to say to make her realise what she is done. RELEVANT COMMENTS When asked why her daughter was not vaccinated for chicken pox She is uptodate on her vaccination schedule. She was vaccinated for measles a month ago and booked in to get the Chickenpox vaccine at 18 months old as normal. TOP COMMENTS fruitpunching If someone did this to my child deliberately infecting them with a disease without discussing it with me with the malicious intent of undermining my parenting to teach me a lesson they would never see my child for extended periods or unsupervised again. deleted Your husband better step up and act like a father and stop acting like a son. Feb 2 2016 Thank you to everyone for your comments inbox messages and advice after my original I read all the comments and messages and they genuinely helped especially the home remedies on how to stop itching. Since my first post was locked and deleted I hope it is okay to briefly summarise here. Over the holidays my motherinlaw Trish 56F deliberately infected my daughter Annie 1F with chickenpox by wrapping her in an infected blanket while she was left alone with her for several hours. Trish did not tell anyone what she had done until Annie came down with a horrible fever and rash. Annie was booked in for her chickenpox vaccination at 18 months but Trish thought what she did is 100 per cent normal despite the fact it is caused Annie significant pain and distress and now scarring to her face and arms. When I found out what she did I was livid and had a shouting match with her and packed up our things to leave the very next morning. It soon came out my husband Jack did not think Trish had done anything wrong. On to the update. I did not think it would be possible but things got worse. I got up first thing the next morning and started packing our stuff into the car. Once I opened it up I kept the keys in my pocket since I was going in and out usually we use Jack's set and leave mine in my bag. While I was packing he sat in the kitchen with Trish and my fatherinlaw 60M and chatted and had coffee like nothing was wrong. Annie was mercifully still asleep so I would just gently belted her in and closed her door when Jack came out and asked if I had everything. I said we were good to go as soon as he was. He said 'okay' and calmly took out his key set and centrally locked the car locking Annie in. I asked him what the hell he was doing and he said we would not be leaving until I apologised to Trish. I think I was stunned into silence because he then took the chance to rehash what he said the previous day that Trish thought she was doing what was best that chickenpox does not kill you and that I was making a bigger deal out of this than I needed to and making Trish feel bad. Yes making her feel bad. All the comments from my last post were swirling around in my head and I told him he needs to stop being a son and start being a father. He screwed up his face and said he would always be Trish's son and that was the point that nobody should speak to his mother the way I had the day before and I needed to apologise to clear the air. I felt like I had entered some kind of weird Twilight Zone where I had accidentally married a 9yearold instead of an adult man so I just asked him to open the car so we could leave. He repeatedly refused then walked back inside and said he would see me in there when I was acting more reasonable. You can probably guess what happened next. I would left my bag on the passenger seat so he probably assumed my keys were in there. Nope. I waited 30 seconds then just hopped into the car and drove away. My phone blew up with a million calls from him Trish and my fatherinlaw. Eventually my mom and dad and my sister Jess who I am super close with called as well. I would briefly texted Jess about what was happening the day before but she was stunned to get the full blowbyblow. By the time I was on the open road I asked her to phone Jack and tell him he could walk home for all I care. Once she heard my side of the story and not Jack's which was apparently that I had gone crazy frightened Trish 'snatched' Annie and 'sped away' she calmed way down. Mom dad and Jess offered to start driving and meet me half way so I could switch with one of them and would not have to drive the full twelve hours by myself in one day. I was so grateful to see them I pretty much broke down in a truck stop parking lot while I blubbered that I loved them. They all took turns driving while I had a rest. It was super reassuring to talk it over and hear that Trish and Jack are the unreasonable ones. Once we got back I stayed at my parents' overnight and they said I could stay as long as I needed. The next few days were fairly tense. I was up most of the night making sure Annie did not scratch which she did anyway somehow and it seemed like she just cried and cried and cried until she was exhausted. She has five scars on her face and a few others on her arms from scratching. I know appearances should not matter but I am so angry her skin is marked for life now over some stupid bullshit. This whole thing is just something I never expected to happen. I answered one of Jack's calls only to have him start a rant that he did not recognise this person I had become so I hung up on him. He was due to come back for the start of the work year which I was not looking forward to but I figured we could make it work as long as Trish was 12 hours away. Then at like 11pm one night I got a very short and formal text from fatherinlaw via Jack's phone saying Trish had come down with shingles and was in the emergency room that Jack was staying there to care for her and that he would work from their house remotely once the year started back up. Jack's been there for the past few weeks tending to momma's every whim I am sure she is put on an Oscarworthy performance of having one foot in the grave and according to Google it should be any day now that her painful crusty pustules go gently into that sweet night. A few weeks ago I was honestly so tired and overwhelmed and in disbelief that I did not know what to do. Now I am back at home with people who actually care about me I think I am starting to realise how lucky I am to see the weird relationship with his mommy this early on. The fact that he cares more about Trish than his own daughter speaks volumes. When he eventually comes back I think we will have to have a serious talk about our future together. tldr Motherinlaw infects my 1yearold with chicken pox on purpose. Husband supports his mommy. He tries to force me to apologise to her by locking our daughter in the car but I peace out with a spare set of keys. Husband has barely spoken to me in the weeks since. Motherinlaw came down with shingles so he is staying with her to nurse her back to health. I do not think any amount of TLC can do the same for our relationship now I have seen the real him. Whew. TOP COMMENTS TinaPesto He locked your daughter in the car holy shit. And assumed you would not be able to get her out I mean that was why he locked her in to threaten you. Holy shit. Good on you for dipping out of there after that. Whatever happens with your marriage moving forward you seem to have your parenting priorities straight. Good luck and I hope Annie feels better soon. bugsdoingthings Yeah this. HE LOCKED A SICK BABY IN THE CAR. Kudos to OP for handling that with a cool head because I would have lost my shit Deminix That is fucking terrifying behavior out of him. That poor baby is going to grow up with that as a father. SkullBearer You only get shingles if you have had chickenpox the new vaccine prevents it. Rather ironic. I would get divorce papers served before mummy dearest decides your daughter should become a breatharian or join Scientology. THIS IS A REPOST SUB I AM NOT THE OOP DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS REMEMBER RULE 7
5217,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: So who diagnosed dysautonomia. I got it but so far I Have been ignored when I tell them about the affects.
5222,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: OofI got them on my back and was so annoyed and uncomfortable. I cannot imagine getting them on my face. I got the vaccine as soon as I became eligible.
5225,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Seriously. My dad did not get the shingles shot because he was healthy and did not need it yeah I know. His shingles started in his optic nerve and he almost went permanently blind in that eye. Only saw is primary care physician because I bullied him into it then realized it might be something serious when his pcp called ophthalmology directly and was told go there now they are waiting for you to arrive.
5226,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had it at 4 and again this year in February. It was a bad dose of it and I remembered reading about people with nerve pain who opt for suicide. I can totally see why. It was the worst pain I have ever experienced. I am left with long term nerve pain. I am sorry for your loss.
5229,I am getting my first dose on Monday at my doctor's office which is about 45 minutes from where I live. Should I be OK to drive home after? Should I bring my partner with me in case of an adverse reaction? I have been on remicadeinflectra for years and I get super tiredbrain for after. Not sure if this one will have similar effects. Thanks
5233,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: agree. and they wonder why people self medicate.
5237,"PSA: Menveo: After receiving the meningococcal vaccine, I experienced a high fever and intense fatigue that lasted for several days. It was a tough week dealing with the side effects, but thankfully I recovered without any further complications. Remember to listen to your body and seek medical advice if you have any unusual reactions after getting vaccinated."
5239,I tentatively recommend the shingles vaccine for people like me who suffer permanent shingles as a result of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine It is a small spider to catch a big fly.
5241,Shingles vaccine: I did not have a reaction to either shot. Maybe I was just lucky???
5243,Shingles vaccine: Dude here but fit the rest of the criteria. Got it in December. Arm was sore for a day or so but that was it. I had a mild case of shingles when I was in my early 20s. No fun. Do not recommend. I would want to do it again and certainly not anything more than mild.
5244,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Yep. Got shingles a few years ago in my early 30s. Was terrible. 010 do not recommend. I had it on the back of my head and over my left ear. The lack of continual exposure was also a theory given to me. My story posted on the shingles sub years ago I want to complain to someone so here is my story. Shingles back left of head mostly under my hair. I developed a headache Sunday night 627. It progressed into the next day. By Wednesday I thought I was going to need to take something for it. I felt intermittent pulsing pains on the left side of my head behind the ear. Fairly frequently but no real because. Definite nerve pain. I thought I had a pinched nerve. It was pretty bad but I was certain it was nerve pain. In retrospect this is probably when the rash started to develop as my skin started to feel irritated. I was aware of my hair. I left work a little early Thursday to pick up a package. Friday was not good but it is the day I am left alone mostly at work Saturday was AWFUL. By Saturday night I wanted to bash my own head into something just to distract myself with a different pain. I did hit myself once over the head and I knew I had to go to the doctor. I was getting fairly worried it was something else. Saturday at work I had told a coworker I think I had bumps on my head under my hair. Turns out I was right but I could not really tell through all the hair. Sunday I had smaller bumps forming along my hairline. Monday I had them on my ear. I currently have a nice long one along the outside she will of my ear. Wooo. I went to my PCP as soon as they opened this week. When they asked how long I had it the doctor was fairly surprised. Like 8 days? Well it did not start off this bad... Anyway I have the antivirals and I was given a steroid injection. My head pain is mostly gone anyway it is focused on the rash at this point. It is not comfortable but it is way better than the pulsing head pain that I could not differentiate between the pain and the rash Doctor's response Yes because it is shingles. I think the steroids have helped me a lot. Steroids always make me feel good. I understand why people use them. Also I learned that I am really stupid when I am in severe pain.
5248,"Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? Doesn't make sense to me......: I did! I'm immunosuppressive and had to be in the ICU because I got shingles really bad on my face and in my mouth. I got permission from my doctor because I'm under 50. I do not want to have to go through that pain again. It was horrible, so yes, I got the shot after."
5251,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: Oh my you poor thing I have been dealing with chronic shingles for almost 20 years and I have never seen it that bad in that area I have got it on the back of my leg right now it is a pain to sit anywhere but especially on the toilet stay away from heat caffeine nuts and try to take lots of vitamins like llysine vitamin b c d and lots of rest I hope you have a speedy recovery and never have to deal with this horrible disease again
5252,"Reoccurring shingles since 2019: I got my first outbreak in 2019 and have gotten them like 2-3 times a year since. I always catch it super early so it's never gotten bad but I'm getting a little freaked out even though I'm the picture of health? All that I can come up with is that it's some weird reaction to getting Covid as the second time was 3 months after. Other than that maybe stress or a high arginine diet? I'm a 39 year old male and honestly the picture of health, perfect blood pressure, cholesterol, great shape, I go to the gym daily, I rarely drink and when I do not until I black out. Anyways I've been on valtrex for a month because the previous 2 outbreaks it came back 3 days after I was off the antivirals, but now I'm afraid when I stop this round it'll come right back. I've also already gotten shingrix and it hasn't helped at all as far as I can tell.I honestly started to spiral then I found this group and it grounded me to see how common this was becoming. I rarely ever get the blisters because I catch it so early, but is there anything anyone can recommend as an immune booster to help stave these off for a few months? Also is anyone else just living with them? How do you do that? Do you just stay on valtrex indefinitely? Hope I get some answers but if not thanks everyone who's already shared in here ??"
5255,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: I was nervous as well but I am soooo glad he got it. He was so little only 10 pounds. He has not been sick at all this winter even being in daycare.
5257,Shingles at 35: Also 35 and just diagnosed yesterday rash appeared Monday on my right side. kind of relieved as I would gone to the doctor convinced they were bed bug bites I attribute it to stress as I gave birth earlier this month and it is been a rough few weeks adjusting. Got my antivirals and my mother in law here to help out. Thankfully transmission to the baby is low since the sores are on my ribs
5259,So my doc and I have already scheduled an appointment about this but in the last few days the thing causing me the most discomfort is nerve pain. Lots and lots of nerve pain. I got a DI no nipples and the entirety of my upper chest has radiating burning pain that does not relent. I have taken gabapentin before for shingles but it was not a medication I enjoyed taking and stopped it after 23 doses. Has anyone else had extreme burning and did you go on meds besides gabapentin? Or how else did you handle it? Ice helps the dull it but that is only a tell fix. Its really the most painful thing right now
5267,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Actually yeah. First the pox and once it cleared up just sick and off for almost a month. Went to the doc BOOM Ya got the diabetes. Obviously it sucked but at least I got to have a normal childhood and eat all the cake and drink skip the Coke. So it is not like I was a diabetic since age 2. While it is been a damper I just took care of myself and went on living life. No poor me. Lived in a tent in Alaska for almost a year. All sorts of stuff. Just celebrated 30 years of it last year. Had a party and made my friends dress up and wear insulin pumps. It was great.
5268,Shingles vaccine experience: Yes. And then shingles in my early 40s and was given the vaccine right after. Nothing since thank goodness. Insurance covered it but thinking my Dr. made a strong case for it to be covered. It is work asking about.
5270,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I took it at a younger age after watching my mother suffer through it. I felt fine for both vaccine vaccines.
5271,"How did Fibro begin for you?: i believe i was born with it. for as long as i can remember i have experienced stabbing pains, multiple times a day that happened anywhere at all throughout the body. they could be extremely painful sometimes, and i would bite myself and wince. my parents were shocked when they learned that i was in pain lmfao, i thougt everyone had it ??i also experienced severe joint pain, but this was always brushed aside as 'growing pains'. but im 22 now and these 'growing pains' are just as bad as ever. when i was about 10? or maybe younger, my parents finally took me to figure out why i was always in pain. eventually a rheumatologist diagnosed me with fibromyalgia."
5272,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Got it like 5 years ago. Painful to say the least. 55
5274,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I was happy to get that vaccine
5276,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep my dad got it with us and it was sooo much worse for him. Mine was super mild.
5277,41 and got Shingles: I got it a couple years back when I was super worn down during marathon training. It was pretty mild but I was miserable and exhausted. I thought it was poison ivy at first.
5278,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I asked for the vaccine at the beginning of this year because my sister had shingles while she was young and I was 48 had my birthday so I am now 49. I was told insurance will not cover it because I am not 50. Well fuck a few months later I had shingles. I am still salty about that. I really wanted the vaccine. I could not afford to pay out of pocket. I am experiencing PHN with no end in sight. It hurts so freaking bad. And I am still exhausted. And did I mention I am still in pain If you can receive the vaccine do it.
5286,Shingles with PHN after: I am sorry to hear that I know I am only 45 myself. It is incredible the pain you get from it. I compared it to getting your eye gouged out with a scalding hot object. Then before I would get this feeling like someone was spraying hot oil on my face like a dripping feeling thing. It is horrible. I hope you get better soon
5287,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Got the antibodies for my son born 346 just before he was discharged from the nicu on day 23. Being sick season I was adamant that he get it before we left. He tolerated it very well no issues at all
5289,Shingles vaccine experience: Brutal The second one was way worse than the first. Have fun.
5290,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Got it on my face Yes my face at the age of 49. Go get the vaccine as soon as you can Imagine an ice pick in your ear and another straight down through your skull. Not to mention the concern it was in my eye.
5292,I had the vaccine I want to make clear I never hated people that did not hated the unforgivable behaviour towards anyone. I can tell you I have had shingles at least 5 times since the jab. These mother fers poisoned us made our society toxic despicable
5293,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: So my MIL got shingles in her 70s and it spread to her eye. She had to pay 10k for medicine Medicare would not cover to save her eye. It worked. She can still see but not as well. I Am 52 but have not had the shot yet.
5298,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I got Shingles in my early 30s around my right eye down the side of my face and around my ear. It was only really painful when I was stressed but it wiped me out. I would be fine in the morning and completely bedridden by afternoon everyday. When I was healing I could not go outside without my right eye closing in the natural light for a couple weeks and it would water badly. After that I could only open it on cloudy days. I had apparently had them on my eye and did not realize it. I have a scar on my eyeball from it.
5299,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Got the first shot. Never went back for the second. Guess I have to start over
5301,Shingles vaccine: I mean I Have had a vaccine make me feel a little bleh for a couple days but every single person I Have known to get shingles were in absolute agony.
5302,I had shingles and that was painful. I to this day suffer from Postherpetic neuralgia. I had to get my shingles vaccine due to my age and pray I do not have reoccurrence but I suffer from nerve pain in general.
5303,Shingles vaccine question: I had zero side effects. Friends of mine had a bad reaction. It is a crap shoot.
5306,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Hey I Am in my twenties and been experiencing the fainting spells but I found out it was due to lack of oxygen because I was sicker than I thought I was.
5307,Got my Shingles vaccine: Got it on my head face and in my eye earlier this year. Can confirm is sucks Lucked out and dodged serious vision loss but I was on disability for 9 weeks because my eye was so light sensitive I could not drive. Took close to three months for the light sensitivity to completely go away and I still have lingering issues I am dealing with. The vaccine is totally better than shingles. I wish I would listened to my doc and gotten it sooner...
5308,Shingles vaccine: I begged to get mine early and I could not sign up fast enough for it. My mom r.i.p contracted shingles on her face beside her eye. She did not realize it was shingles before she started scratching it and rubbing her eye. She was actually at my house visiting for Christmas. After a day or so we realized it was bad and my sister took her to the hospital. Shingles. Soon after she started to get sicker and ended up in the hospital with encephalitis from the shingles. It was so scary. The encephalitis caused 22 strokes. They thought she was going to die. She was never the same again but she lived five more years with dementia and hallucinations from the encephalitis. She did recover some of her memories after a long hospital stay but not all of them. She passed away February 2020 right before we got hit with Covid. It was so hard watching her decline and be so confused. Please do not mess around with shingles especially on the face.
5311,Shingles at 35: I am 32 and on day 23 of my shingles drama same onset as OP only I worked in nursing homes and knew exactly what it was first blister. Went into GP ireland and said I have shingles he said well you are very young let me see looked for 0.5 seconds went oh dear yes you do good call. they do get better my rash has faded across my ribs on day 15 but the pain is remaining still at night and the itch makes me want to take my skin off other than that I am recovering slowly. I got anti virals on day 2 and have been taking supplements lysine multivitamins and folic acid. My blood tests I got showed my immune system was absolutely shocking so getting shingles made sense.
5313,Facebook Mom groups: I do not know the stats for school but my daycare allows vaccine exemptions. Owner was clear that there were no kids with an exemption currently. Daycare is a huge shortage in my area most of the vaccine are at home daycares or with a stay at home parent. I do know my neighbor does not vaccinate though. I made an extra trip across town to get my 4 month old the rsv vaccine because they did not have the right dose at her pediatrician office when we went for her 4 month appointment.
5314,Shingles vaccine: Not over 50 but I have had shingles and it sucked royally. Felt like some prick was splattering boiled oil on sunburned skin. Would not wish it on anyone
5316,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles when I was a teenager. I spent an entire summer druged out of my mind. It totally fucked my social life. I was already in the fringes. I did not really have any friends after 16 going on 17. It was a lonely existence. I would not wish that shit on my worst enemy. Some 35 years later I still get mildish pain in the infected area on my back. The pain comes from an area that is otherwise dead of sensation when being touched. Do not fuck with that shit Get vaccine
5325,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles as an adult 23 days after my 1 yr old daughter got her chicken pox vaccine. I stand by that it was connected.
5328,Shingles vaccine: Everyone Is different but for most the second dose is worse. It was for me.
5329,Shingles vaccine experience: I am one of those  pain persists still nearly two years on and I got what is considered a typical presentation on my torso.
5334,Shingles vaccine: Shingles was the 2 worst pain I have ever felt
5338,Should You Get the RSV VACCINE? What is RSV? What Are the Dangers of RSV? A Doctor Explains: I had to switch clinics due to insurance coverage this year. I am new do not know much about the doctors and had to do an Established Care Visit. My insurance also insisted too and wanted me to do a yearly physical. I viamently refused that. When I made my appointment and went in it was really uncomfortable for me and my anxiety went into high gear. It did not get any better once I got in the room. They also made me and said they had to by the laws in my state answer some really personal questions also questioning my competency. It did not hit me until a week later because I was so relieved to get out of there physically. Getting to the vaccine part I am over 60 but have never had the vaccine they suggested I get. I do not have any chronic conditions or high risk factors. The last flu shot I got I had a severe reaction too so stopped getting them. This new doctor practically shoved getting them down my throat. I said no and stood my ground. I do not run to the doctor for every bump or bruise. I only go when it is absolutely necessary. Just because you are over 60 does not mean your health is bad or you are incompetent. I wish more doctors would realize that I am just very disenchanted with both medical professionals and health insurance.
5339,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got it at 24. Right after I had my son. My doctor freaked me out so bad and tested me for HIV and AIDS and cancer he said no one ever got it unless they were old or had a shit immune system. It was the worst thing ever. I do not ever want it again. Still have scarring on my left side. Like chickenpox but sends lightning bolts to your insides every time you scratch. I am so scared to get it again.
5341,Shingles vaccine: My husband and I were sick for a week. But I hear it is better than getting the shingles. My husband's health is good and we are 63 years old.
5345,Shingles shot: I just had arm pain my husband felt pretty crappy. The advice to get it on a Friday is good or if he has sick days he needs to use plan on needing one or two.
5351,Shingles vaccine experience: I needed to have all my childhood vaccinations again along with the shingles vaccination progressively after having chemo and stem cell transplant. My immune system was very low. This was all happening through COVID so had that vaccine added in for good measure. I had no significant reactions other than a minimal fever from all the various vaccinations. Years later I am experiencing no longterm side effects either.
5352,"<user>: RT <user>: U.S. expert panel will discuss waning effectiveness of some vaccines, new shingles shot. <url>"
5353,Oh my. Do Not want to be ya. Shingles vaccine is awful
5355,Shingles second shot update.: The same day was fine for me. Its the next day that packs a whallop. I hope you continue to feel well
5357,The pharmacist who gave me the 2 part vaccine for shingles warned me it would probably make me uncomfortable. He also warned me the 2nd dose was going to feel worse than the 1st. He was right But I have had shingles. They were much worse than the vaccine.
5362,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles 9 years ago and got the vaccine last year. I had no side effects from either shot. I still have scars from my bout. It was painful but it was the early days of a shitty divorce so it was not the worst thing going in my life at the time it was a welcome distraction actually. Still unless you are in the midst of getting divorced its definitely a good thing to avoid.
5365,all shots are toxic when we read the FDA insert This is my friend Nancy Henderson one of the many victims of the lies of the tetanus shot called DTaP its 3 in 1. Nancy got severe shingles and almost died. Severe reported tetanus vaccine
5370,Long Term Side Effects from Shingrix vaccination. Chronic ear pain dizzyness vertigo.: I m so sorry you went through this adversity But thank you for sharing this. I currently have shingles was diagnosed 3 weeks ago and I m still experiencing a lot of nerve pain on my right scalp ear neck and shoulder. The pain from shingles is the worst I don t want to go through this again and was seriously considering the shingles vaccine once I am completely healed. But after reading your post I ll definitely do some more research on it. I am immune compromised so there may be some complications if I get the vaccine. All this to say I appreciate your post
5372,Burning pain but not severe: Ouch that looks awful and sore . I got them when I was 58 and they were terrible. The pain was horrible. I got medicine and had an allergic reaction to medication ended up in Emergency Room with lips swollen and breathing problems. Rash was really bad and itchy . Had nerve pain.
5373,Hi  wondering what peoples experiences have been. The shingles vaccine knocked me out. Thanks.
5379,Pediatrician not giving vaccines: I wish I had any advice regarding the complaint process. I hope something comes of it. that is a huge oversight My guess is they straight up forgot or skipped by accident and this is them trying to cover it up instead of admitting fault. If you would like them done sooner than whenever you can get in with the new pediatrician I would suggest calling your local county health unit. Most have at least one day a week where they do routine and childhood vaccinations. We moved right when our daughter was due for her 4 month vaccines and we just took her record in to the health unit and explained that we did not have a pediatrician yet. Got them all done sameday including rotavirus and pneumococcal and it was extremely cheap for self pay. Most will also work with insurance companies we just did not have insurance for that state yet because we would just moved and all.
5383,Shingles vaccine experience: The same as the first some Tylenol and gone in a couple of days
5386,"Shingles vaccine: second dose: My second was OK, but I also took some Alieve right after the shot"
5388,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: That sucks. I got shingles and it just itched. I know two other people besides myself who got shingles before 50. I do not think its as rare as its made out to be.
5392,"Newbie here: Did I understand you correctly that you personally have had shingles 17 time?! Do you mind me asking if you know why so many times? I am on day 8 of shingles, first time and I sure hope this would be last... I so regret not getting the vaccine a couple of years ago, when my PCP offered it at my 50-year checkup. :("
5393,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You can still get shingles even if you were vaccinated
5396,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got Shingles on my head in my 40s before I could get the shot and it left me with asymmetrical hearing loss and now I wear a hearing aid. Yeah that shit is awful. I got the vaccine on my 50th birthday. Happy birthday to me.
5400,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I got shingles like a decade ago at a Harry Potter con which I guess was stressful. I was in my midtwenties. It was a mild case but it made everything uncomfortable for a while. Do not recommend. That is great to hear the vaccine is available for younger people now
5402,Got vaccine today: You were so young to get shingles. I started the antivirals the day after I saw the 3 dots and then had a huge line of blisters the following day. It was a Sunday and it was so painful that I did an online Dr video to get out of pain. I had no idea that all of these days later it actually hurts worse. Every day I had new bumps and the next day another long line of blisters. It did that 5 times days in a row You also stay healthy No more shingles for either of us.
5403,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mother had it twice not far apart. Bad each time.
5410,Hello. it is me again. Just finished my 28 th 29 th recurrences. 28 was on the right side of my face body and 29 is on my left face shoulder back etc. My face is becoming discolored scars on more scars. I also developed flu and bronchitis. My lymph nodes have been swollen for a month. The steroids make me feel crazy and since the shingles got in my eyes this is the first time in a while I have been able to post. Can you help me? Does anyone know how to reset a person s immune system. I also have fi bro myalgia and arthritis. Since I spend most of my time contagious I was asked to resign until I can get the vaccine for shingles. The problem is that my doctor will not give me the vaccine until I have been a few months free of shingles. My immune system has always been compromised since birth. Is there a way to reset it?
5413,Living the life we have to live... sucks: I couldn't take Tysabri because I have the JCV. Do I understand what you're saying is that I can take a genetic test and it will tell me if I would have the PML risk?
5415,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Fwiw my immunocompromised roommate had no side effects to either shingles shot except a sore arm.
5417,The shingles vaccine is a tough one. It knocks you on your butt.
5418,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Wife had shingles in her 40s. Got a palsy from it that 15 years later still has not recovered from. Its no joke.
5421,Has the chicken pox or shingles vaccine helped anyone for cold sores?: No  I tried that once and got the worst outbreak of my life s
5424,My colleague had a case of shingles that had him down and out for 3 weeks face eye just really bad. He texted me I am BEGGING you to get the vaccine AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I did. Felt bad for a day but so worth it.
5427,Antivirals making me feel like hot garbage: I feel like total shit It makes me feel awful. Extreme dizziness and light headedness to the point I feel like I Am going to pass out and horrible nausea. I have a horrible headache but I think that is due to the shingles and not the nausea as the rash is on my head.
5428,PSA Get Vaccinated if you can: I keep thinking about calling my old oncologist's office to ask the staff to thank him for vaccinating me for shingles. Maybe I can still message him. Who knows lol. I got my 8th COVID shot on Friday when I thought it was just bumps from a bug bite. I got lucky with chemo and developed anti mosquito properties and have not had a mosquito bite since 2018 but I have noticed some gnat bites last summer and recently. So I assumed my anti mosquito properties were wearing off. Turned out it was shingles. Confirmation should be back in by Monday when the culture comes back. I Do Not Know when I will be called though. My old oncologist said he is heard from many patients about no longer getting bug bites and called it a silver lining for chemo patients. I have not worn bug spray since 2018 either.
5430,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I got the vaccine for the first time at age 45. I had to have a procedure to reinvent precancerous cells from my cervix. My doctor recommended it as research now shows it prevents cancer even at my age. I would have gotten it years ago had they known.
5432,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I had that crap in my 30's now 50 while deployed overseas. The deployed medical was like what did you get near and kept asking how old are you should not have shingles It sucked itched hurt to breath and cough. just having my shirt touch it was painful. I was vaccine against it. Military plugged me with everything from the start to the end of my career. I was vaccinated against chicken pox and still had that too when I was little guy several years ago.
5435,Hi I have been taking 900mg a day for around ten months after a bad dose of shingles. I have made the decision to taper down and finally stop. I have gone down to 600mg a day and this is the third day of the lower dose. Its been what I was expecting I have been though opiate withdrawal BUT I have the most horrendous lower back pain which I did not have prior to starting taking it. Did anyone else get this or have I done something stupid to my back?
5436,"Massachusetts has the highest rate of childhood vaccinations out of all states (based on DTaP, MMR, varicella, influenza, vaccine combos, and HPV vaccines)."
5437,Background As per the title my dad is in Spain at the moment and he got infected with COVID19 and is seriously ill mid 70s M 6'2ft up to date on vaccinations for COVID19 RSV flu etc. 220 pounds their condition is active COVID19 serious breathing trouble hypoxia pneumonia and likely other issues as they are going through ongoing tests right now Timeline of Events 1. My parents US doctor prescribed them Paxlovid prior to my dad and mom traveling to Spain. My parents also got the most recent round of COVID19 boosters for older adults about 4 weeks ago. 2. They both tested positive for COVID19 on Wednesday April 24 with a molecular Lucira COVID19 and Flu AB test and they both started taking their 5day course of Paxlovid. They also saw a rural doctor in Spain who prescribed them 5 other medications for my dad to take as his COVID infection was much more severe than my moms. However I cannot figure out if these medications are worthwhile for COVID19 andor if they are contraindicated with Paxlovid since its all in Spanish. This includes the following medications 1. Levofloxcico 2. Varidasa 3. Paracetamol 4. Flutox Jarabe 5. Vontolin. After asking on some other Reddit boards and doing some research myself it seems to be the case that there is no information on any interactions between these drugs and Paxlovid no information available suggesting there is indeed an interaction or no interactions so no information either good or bad. However I assume someone with a medical background might know whether these might be a contraindication risk due to their general drug classes. Got in contact with a US based pulmonologist. who suggested that he stop taking varidasadrug 2 which he did not sure if this caused things to get better or worse or if he would have gotten worse regardless and that he might have hypoxia and thus likely cannot flybe flown to Madrid or back to US given his current condition not sure if this meant only airplane travel or if helicopter travel to Madrid is also barred due to hypoxia. Given that my parents just recently got new COVID vaccine boosters started Paxlovid course immediately after feeling ill and testing positive I Am not sure why my dad is so sick already yes he is very old yes I understand vaccines are not sterilizing etc.. I have a partial concern that these 5 other random drugs this rural doctor prescribed now 4 as of this morning might be making things worse since Paxlovid is quite harsh on the kidneysliver and all these other drugs may be adding no additional health benefit and instead are just increasing overall toxicity andor interfering with Paxlovid. Obviously this thought process could just be unconscious biasseeking something to blame here and is not rational consideration. 3. My Dads condition worsened on Friday April 26 and taken to a small rural hospital in Andjar Spain he needed to go to the nearest one AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. This is where my mom and dad currently arewhere my dad was admitted. My mom is sick with COVID19 as well but her condition is nowhere near as bad so she is trying to coordinate things and communicate to me status updates. I believe he is now on oxygen and getting various tests. Pulse oximeter denotes low oxygen levels and they are running other tests. Confirmed he has pneumonia and are starting IV antibiotics. 4. My dad started his 5day Paxlovid course Wednesday so he theoretically should be done with it Sunday or Monday I Am fearing that if he is already in this bad of a state with the added buffer of Paxlovid interfering with viral replication I cannot imagine what the likely COVID rebound situation will be on Sunday or Monday when he completes the course andor whether he can even get an additional package of Paxlovid in Spain assuming a doctor would recommend that he do that again toxicity might be too high as is. Not sure what is liver AST enzymes are at the moment. Main Requests So I guess my ask here is that I am seeking any SpainbasedSpanish Speaking individuals who can advise on a. Good pulmonologist andor other relevant medical expert somewhat near Andjar Spain or who is in another part of Spain who can help with advice feel free to DM me if appropriate. Or any recommendation for a goodlarger hospital around Andjar Spain since they likely cannot make it all the way to Madrid which is 4 hours away where big academic hospitals are. b. the following medications 1. Levofloxcico 2. Varidasa 3. Paracetamol 4. Flutox Jarabe 5. Vontolin. There appears to be no information on whether they interact negatively with Paxlovid. Also not sure if these medications are good for COVID19 andor if there are other medications available in Spain people might recommend as I am not sure if Paxlovid is available in Spain or at least this part of Spain. He stopped taking drug 2.Varidasa as explained above as per telehealth conversation with good pulmonologist in US but not sure if that is the correct course obviously doctors know best but it may be the case that a US doctor would recommend against this medication simply because they do not know what it is and its unclear if there is a US analog. Other Requests c. Any good recommendations on how to go about dealing with Spanish to English language barrier? I only speak English and am based in USA but it seems all the medical staff at this small hospital speak Spanish only so not sure how to communicate and coordinate with them and not sure how to get medical records from US doctors sent to Spain doctors so they can use it. Basically looking for a doctor med student etc. in this area or some kind of app paid translation services etc. who speaks Spanish and English and who can serve gap between the language barrier here. d. Any other suggestions on how to handle this situation? Maybe calling US embassy or something? Maybe they can help figure out how to transfer health records from US to Spain since I assume HIPAA will be an issue? Really not sure what to do. Concluding Thoughts Apologies in advance if this breaks any rules andor is quite an unreasonable ask......not sure what else to do at this stage as I am an ocean away and my passport is expiredI Am stuck in USA my sister is likely able to get to Spainwhere they are in next 48 hours as her passport is not expired since she travels a lot admittedly not sure there is much either of us can do as we are not medical persons. While my mother is with him and does speak some Spanish it seems her COVID19 infection while not hospitalizing her is giving her brain fog making her extremely tired and so she is having a hard time conversing with parties here. I love my father and absolutely cannot let him pass like this if allowed under this subreddits rules I can pay if needed to get help here andor donate to charity of ones choosing or something else that is allowable as I realize this is quite a remote part of Spain and a rather lengthy and complicated ask. Please help me I Am desperate and not sure what to do here this feels like a perfect storm of everything going wrong all at once.
5438,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I was really lucky that I did not have any problems with it My husband did not get so lucky...
5440,My Wonderful Dad died in November after being told he must have the booster he was only 74 and fine he got chest pains then sudden heart attack. I had 2 pfizer got shingles x6 now have CFS brain fog neuropathy pain a grave to visit instead of my beloved Dad.Sorry4urloss2
5448,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Interesting. I thought maybe I either had ringworm or atopic dermatitis in late 2020early 2021 figured it was the detergent so we have not used that one again. It was not THAT bad though just super itchy and apparently shingles is hellish I also did not get Covid until 5 months after the rash went away so no idea what would have triggered it. Still have a scar on my shin though from scratching it.
5450,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Are you referring to the chickenpox vaccine for children or the shingles vaccine? I thought if you get the chickenpox vaccine as a child preventing a case of chickenpox that you will never get shingles or need a shingles vaccine as an adult. Thus reducing overall chickenpox cases and therefore shingles as well. Hmmm I will look into that. And the thing about the shingles vaccine similar to the Covid vaccine is that it will not absolutely guaranteed prevent a breakout but the likelihood of a breakout is much lower symptoms will be milder and will more than likely prevent hospitalizationdeath. Cool thing about the Covid vaccine it also reduces transmissibility you cannot actually give someone shingles or chicken pox when you have shingles. I had shingles last year at 45 during an extended period of incredible stress which suppresses the immune system and yeah that sucked. And I had a very mild case. So I certainly hope neither one of us gets it again Not sure what you mean by catching it early? Are there antivirals like for flu or Covid or herpes for shingles? Did not think there was anything they could do for shingles once you have a breakout. Or I guess you meant develop it at an earlier age than normal. You do not actually 'catch' shingles that damn virus is just there waiting hiding in your nerves somewhere from whenever you caught chicken pox and will always be there. And the likelihood of a breakout goes up as you age because of the immune system wearing out yes sadly that too like everything else. Anyway you can do more than hope get the shingles vaccine. You will have to pay out of pocket think you have to be over 60 before insurance will pay. But might be worth it Should not be more than a couple hundred dollars. Do not know how often you would need it maybe just once now or in the next few years and another when you are older 60 something?. Pretty sure it is not yearly like flu or Covid. Just to let you know if you have had a shingles breakout at an earlier than normal age that is a sign you are very likely to get it again. No telling when or how bad it will be. Times of stress other illnesses. So you might want to look into it. I certainly am
5452,RSV immunization for infants Scarborough ON: I am certain it was what I read on the Ottawa Public Health website when I looked in August after my son was born. He got his vaccine in October at 2 months old. A friend had her Feb 2024 baby vaccinated in the fall as well. I seems it has since been updated as it now is only available to those born during 20242025 respiratory season up to April 2025 or unless high risk then it extends to high risk children under 24 months. Sorry if I mislead you I was not aware of the update when I commented. I will update my original comment to reflect the change.
5455,Vulvar shingles at 15dpo: The rash on my abdomen and from the steri strips was definitely separate from the ulcers on your labia. Thinking back to orthopysurgeries I had similar reactions to the surgical soap and steri strips but did not put 2 together until now. . At least I know now if there has to be another surgery at some point.
5457,: One of my friends age 38 died suddenly today I am afraid to bring up the subject due to the social stigma around it but I know she was vaccinated.
5458,Shingles and other Vaccines: You Are NOT being a babythose shingles shots were the worst. I was incapacitated for a couple days as if I had a horrible case of the flu. But if you have done both you just need to get through this and you will never have to do it again. Sorry I know you are suffering
5460,Any guidance for getting vaccine AFTER a case of shingles?: Yes if you have taken a significant hit to your immune system then you should wait until you think you are fully recovered and then some. You might want to run it by your doctor. My personal experience with taking a vaccine too soon after a significant illness was a massive kidney infection. In that case it was Yellow Fever vaccine which is pretty gnarly anyways but I took it 3 weeks after I recovered from some nasty influenza and it was brutally painful.
5461,Shingles vaccine experience: Been through both shots. Very uneventful. I do not even remember my arm being all that sore.
5466,Found a leak starting from the ridge that completely soaked the two sheets closet to the top got it dried off but here is the initial damage I found. it is weird that o could not see any signs of damage when walking on the roof but under those shingles is a nightmare.
5468,Am I being a crazy FTM?: As many have said everyone has their own comfort levels My baby is 13 weeks  I feel comfortable with him in stores etc as long as I Am baby wearing or hes covered in his car seat. I Have allowed family to hold him as long as they are not sick wash their hands  no kisses. My babe also has had his 2 month vaccines  RSV antibody. Everyone is different  it would not be right to call you crazy You Are doing what you feel is best for your baby  there is nothing wrong with that 
5470,Shingles and other Vaccines: Yes. They make me sick too. I have a mild egg allergy that first showed up when I was a kid and nearly died from penicillin. I understand that most vaccines are made in an egg solution. You may have it too. But I take them anyway and just plan on being knocked out for the next 24 hours.
5472,RSV shot: The RSV shot saved my baby. About a month after he came home from the NICU he caught RSV. It was nothing more than a runny nose. It lasts less than 36 hours. Because of the shot we never had to go back to the hospital. He was never put on oxygen. His life was never in danger.
5477,9 months ago I saw 5 what I thought were warts in my perineal area. First biopsy came back as verruca vulgaris. Nurses said I Am not contagious after removal no need to disclose. Okay got them removed. Did not have sex with anyone new since I thought I had a recurrence. Got another biopsy at a different lab came back as verruca vulgaris but doctor said most likely its condyloma since its in the genital area. Okay decided to rest to see if its a strain covered by the vaccine I got gardasil 4 when I was 15 and was hoping my strain would be covered by gardasil 9. PCR test showed negative for 20 types of hpv. Dermatopathologist changed her mind and said you know what it probably is not warts but keratosis. Reviewed the orginal biopsy I did with the nurses and said suspicious for verruca but due to lack of prominent koilocytes and no viral DNA she prefers to call it benign keratosis from trauma or irritation I have OCD and wipe that area a lot. However they said IF it is hpv Ill get additional lesions that we can test again.. Problem  I met a new guy and am wondering what I should tell him. Of course I would rather not tell him anything because if I had to disclose I would rather just break up. My community is pretty small and I do not want word that I possibly had hpv to get around. On one hand I really want to move past this and pretend like I never had hpv but its still a possibility I have a strain not covered by either vaccine. On the other hand if it was hpv my warts that were diagnosed twice as common warts were removed 9 months ago and I never had a true recurrence that looked like the original warts just skin irregularities I froze off anyway because of OCD. But now I wonder if I should keep freezing everything if its just irritation or if I should let it rest since the cryotherapy is starting to affect the pigmentation. What should I do? What would you do if you were me? This is a tough situation and I am navigating this with my therapist who thinks I should move on with my life and listen to the doctors gut feeling but it would kill me if I gave this to someone.
5478,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Yeah. That is interesting that they do not. Wasted opportunity. I had epiglotitis when I was 2. My throat swelled up so much I could not breathe. I had to be trached and stay in an oxygen tent for three days. As soon as I came home I got chicken pox. My Mom somehow thought I picked it up in the hospital. They were not making the connection back then. Then I got shingles when I was 21. Three docs had to look at it because no one had seen it in a person so young. It went away in a week itched like hell though and hurt less unless you scratched which you could not help doing. Nothing since. Yet I have never received anything encouraging me to get this done. Mammogram colon screening etc. all the time. I know I need to get it but Kaiser does not cover because I am apparently too young. Have not heard that on a long time.
5479,Shingles vaccine experience: Years ago when i was getting a flu shot the nurse asked which arm I wanted in  i said left. She told me to put my left hand in my pocket and slouch a little on that side. She gave me the shot in the back of my arm while my arm muscles were totally relaxed. I was just a little sore the next day. I Have been doing this ever since
5480,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: The virus can crop up and express symptoms rarely. I had chicken pox as normal when i was very young. Developed shingles when i was 25 during a high stress job. Just some itchy bumps behind my ear. Apparently that s dangerous place to get them. I went to an urgent care clinic and they gave me something antiviral meds. I was fine.
5482,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: Agreed. I had it a few years back in my eye and face and it was scary. I freaked out when the eye doctor told me it can because blindness. The side effects of the vaccine were annoying but not nearly as bad as actually having it.
5483,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My mom loves to tell the story of how I infected my sister's elementary school with chickenpox when I was a child because everyone gets it we just helped them along. Well when in my late 20s I got shingles in my eyeball and it took all of the strength I had to not kill myself right then and there. I have had knee surgery teeth drilled without anesthesia torn ligaments. My L5S1 disc has been herniated for the last few years and I am walking on a torn meniscus until I cannot stand it and eventually go for a full knee replacement. I am no stranger to pain but shingles had me writhing on the floor for a solid week begging for the relief of death. I did not know such intense and profound pain was possible. If my wife had not been by my side I probably would not have survived it. 2 years later I am still fighting the virus and have failed to wean off the eye drops. I take antivirals daily and have been attempting to taper off the eye drops for the last 18 months. It is almost certain that I will experience a flare up at some point in my life and the thought of that scares me more than anything. Anyone who knowingly and willingly infects their kids with chickenpox should have their children removed from their care and be brought up on charges. I will always resent her for causing me that pain and I live with guilt knowing that even though I was a child several dozen adults will experience the pain I experienced at some point in their lives. If my mom intentionally infected my child she would never see them again so long as she lived.
5486,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Mom has it and had vaccine.
5487,Does Anyone Else....Feel Like Their Going Through a Flare Up after taking Orecuvus????: Yep about week ago. Damn shingles vaccination because a three day flair up.
5488,Baby RSV Shot: My baby just had the RSV shot a few weeks ago and she did great Cried when they poked her but that was it Good luck to you. I bet it goes great
5489,Shingles vaccine: I do not remember any issues after either shot. I did have some issues with the Covid vaccines. But those never lasted longer than a day. The last Covid vaccine did not affect me at all.
5495,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccines. My arm was sore for a bit but shingles is a nightmare. I had a coworker who had it and it was basically destroying his life.
5496,First postshingles behind ear: I am sorry. I do not have anything positive. Here is my condensed but long because lots of issues experience and some suggestions. I also went to the ER several times over the course of more than one year for a neverresolved neverinvestigated issue that I think was actually shingles maybe even chicken pox and shingles and definitely other bacterial and fungal infections as well these latter two were only recently confirmed. Most of my outer body my eyes and my insides are affected. It was never treated and became complex. It is been hell. Lots of other medical appointments and grocery outings had to be canceled for months. I barely slept or ate. I got no advice from ER docs. When asked probably the first ER doc who looked barely not really at this said the viral infection their diagnosis but did not name any disease or pathogen even after being pressed for this multiple times will not spread and I do not need to be cautious about avoiding contact. Bad info. I asked for blood tests and skin samples to each doctor I saw all denied them for these related issues. A dermatologist completely dismissed my symptoms when it was still early but significant. The appointment was actually to take a skin biopsy the derm insisted this on multiple occasions prior then refused to do it at the appointment without explanation. They just pushed expensive cosmetic procedures and said they are only interested in those otherwise they have nothing to offer. During one of the really bad stages all of the ER nurses and nurse receptionists were actually horrified and asked me reactive questions like they were not the medical professionals. They told me the doc would run tests but then the ER doc who finally showed did no testing looked for one second said nothing just prescribed prednisone and said merry Christmas. About three other docs dismissed the issue. A few pharmacists were sympathetic but could not do much to help. A moresympathetic ER doc finally at least gave me some valacyclovir after I presented a lot of personal findings and requested a prescription along with dosage notes taken from one of the pharmacists who recommended the valacyclovir. Topical and oral antihistamine meds only worsened the symptoms. I am normally sensitive or intolerant to them. Topical eczema meds also made things worse. Previously tolerated skin products like mild lotions now all burned Aveeno was usually okay. Aveeno eczema lotion was not particularly any better. There was a monthlong course of suppressive valacyclovir at some point because I suspected I had a really bad and spreadout case of cold sores herpes simplex. It was too late and too progressed by then so it had no effect. I took oral lysine for a few months too. No noticeable improvement when taking these. The last outbreaks never healed but sort of subsided after months of agony and extremely diligent washing sanitizing topically overdosing on essential oils and using a few several hundred dollars' worth of topical cold sore medication available in tiny tubes only. That last thing was the most helpful for my skin symptoms. I recently got a new rash a little over a week ago that is progressing rapidly and looks and feels like the horribly severe one I got several months ago just not as severe as quickly in as many places yet. But it is spreading all over. It could be viral was said by different docs on multiple occasions. My new and first GP recently saw me and said the same. They immediately thought shingles but then they said they doubt it because the rash has blisters instead of being completely flat...when medical literature describes shingles to form blisters. The GP then said it could be chicken pox instead. But did not give me any meds or tests. I asked to get a culture or skin sample but they said there is nothing to swab this was said before by some of the ER docs even when things were oozing. But they literally had taken a dry swab from me a few weeks ago which showed those bacterial and fungal infections and proved their theory wrong and the Rx I was on for a while totally counterintuitive. Now I am being referred to some other GP at the same clinic who supposedly has an interest in skin issues I have met three such docs before they all turned out to be completely incompetent as general doctors often doing and saying harmful and factually incorrect things and in the skin side seemingly for the money. This other GP I have met a few times before. They are racist they really made it known without any prompt semiretired and decided right away they do not like me so they try to do the least except say irrelevant and offensive things and make things difficult. Things do not look hopeful for me at all. I have gathered from medical informational articles and other people's experiences that it would be best to get the vaccine for immunity instead of relying on antivirals for theoretical reduction in severity healing time. My symptoms have been severe and chronic and I have a bunch of other health problems. My challenge will be to get the appropriate testing and treatments. I live in a small city in Canada with an especially bad health care system. I just got a GP who is only available every month or so and they have shown that they do not take some issues seriously. It is crucial to find a GP who cares is competent and is a regular point of contact. Request blood tests antivirals and vaccination. But vaccines are typically only offered to immunocompromised people and people who were never vaccinated like young children. Stock up on OTC products that can lessen the suffering. Spending money to lessen physical labor and skin contact housework cooking certain grooming will be helpful though difficult financially. My hands are affected and I need to do all of my own housework. I have been using leftover nitrile gloves while brushing teeth doing dishes and preparing food. I wish I could use them for other activities but I do not due to expenses and sweat buildup. I tried putting loose socks on my hands in bed but they easily fell off. Will be trying with a tighter pair. Other than the vaccines and antivirals you have to just rely on your immune system to fight the virus. Hang in there '
5497,Shingles again?: Hours later now almost no weird sensations. Just achey pains on that side. So weird. I took the day off tomorrow and I Am going to see if a walkin visit is warranted. Something just feels so off. I realized today that in December I had a crazy acne outbreak on my forehead. Could that have been shingles and I missed it? Because obviously if I Am shingles prone my body is going with the variety is the spice of life version
5498,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: The light sensitivity has been the worst for me I could not keep either eye open in the daylight. Good luck.
5499,The shingles vaccine can make your arm sore and even kind of limp out of commission for a day or two. A day or two THAT IS NOTHING compared to what shingles can do to you. Long lasting effects of shingles can be hell. The vaccination against shingles is a blessing Shingles
5502,I just saw a post on here about chickenpox and shingles and how they got shingles in their 30s. I want to spread this message for all millennials as we were the last generation to have chickenpox parties. I actually got the vaccine as I Am 30 and born in 94 so I Am a very late millennial. My girlfriend 29F got shingles recently. Here Is my comment This happened to my girlfriend recently and thank god we caught it early and it was not bad. I proceed to run down the rabbit hole in research. I was vaccinated as a child but she had chickenpox as a child. Here Is a huge problem that is going to arise in the future for those who had chickenpox as a child. Most everyone my age 30 will have had the chickenpox vaccine it came out in 1995. And how the virus works is it is weak to a child but the virus never leaves your body. It stays dormant in your spine until your immune system forgets how to fight it and it can reappear at anytime. The old method of constantly exposing children to chickenpox kept the virus running around and exposing people to it. Children adults around children young adults everyone would be somewhat around the virus due to these parties. So everyone is immune system was constantly being exposed to it over and over again and their immune systems would stay up to date with it. So shingles would not become a real problem until you were elderly. But with the vaccine there is basically no kids around exposing anyone to the virus because they never got it. So now those who got chickenpox at their parties are getting shingles a lot earlier than before. Late twenties early 3040s. Which is entirely possible to begin with but its starting to happen more and more. Shingles is fucking horrible and I do not wish it on anyone. They do not regularly give shingles vaccines to people under 50 so I encourage anyone who gets a weird skin rash or one open looking wound to immediately see a minute clinic or doctor and have it looked at if you had chickenpox as a kid. If you catch it early antivirals can do serious work and you will be in much better shape. If you do not catch it early you are in for a world of pain. So learn what shingles and early shingles looks like and familiarize yourself with it so you can catch it early. Tldr short video here explaining it Edit I know something like this is horrifying but that is why its important to be familiar with the virus. Its okay to be scared but that is why you take 30 minutes to be prepared. Go google and read up on it. Talk to your doctor. Be informed so you have a chance to subside it if it ever pops up.
5505,Is the level of varicellazoster virus IgG associated with symptomatic status of genital herpes simplex virus infection? A casecontrol study  Bret S. Palmer Alan Tang Stephen Winchester Mark Atkins Simon Barton Peter Kelleher 2023: Stay away from the Shingles vaccine. I was misdiagnosed with Shingles. As soon as I got the shot that is when all hell broke loose. That was 18 months ago. My symptoms are finally slowly down. I do not suggest it.
5507,Hi Everyone I am a 73 year old male that is already had a severe case of the shingles or as some people call it zoster several year's ago that covered the entire right side of my head that was so bad that I could not hardly see out of my right eye which is the one that has the best of vision. I received the two dose regimen with the first dose administered on 07262018 the second dose administered on 10262018. As I surely do not ever want to become infected with shingles in the future I took it upon myself to make a visit to the kroger pharmacy where I obtain my prescriptions as well as my required vaccination to start new regimen of the shin gri x vaccine. When the pharmacist discovered the most recent date of receiving the last immunization she informed me that any additional vaccination of shin gri x were not needed as the vaccine is supposed to be good for the rest of my lifetime. I accepted her answer as a valid answer but I am still rather hesitant as to whether or not her statement is actually valid or not. Has anyone else ran into this situation and if so what was your outcome? Thanks David Update Per a recommendation from another reddit or I have submitted a new thread in r Ask Docs Medical Questions reddit area so if and when I receive an answer there I will come back here and delete this reddit post.
5508,Shingles vaccine?: It was pretty much a nonevent for me both shots. I usually react to flu and COVID shots so was happy this was not an issue.
5509,Shingles vaccine: I have had both shingles shots and had no problems. The COVID vaccine did not bother me except a sore arm. My husband always has a reaction to the COVID vaccine but he was fine after both shingles shots.
5514,Shingles vaccine: I felt nothing unusual after any of the shots you listed.
5518,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I really think that they need to lower the age of the vaccine. I know at least a dozen people in their 40s that have gotten shingles in the last two years. I know there's some evidence that covid may be to blame for the resurgence as it seems to have the ability to reactivate latent viruses in people's systems, but Shingrix could help with this."
5520,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Bingo. Exactly my experience. But on the first one I tripled up with the C covid shingles and flu vaccine at the same time so I fully expected a bit of fallout. I do not know much about shingles but this thread has made me very glad I took care of it.
5523,Hi 67 male in great health. Biohacker but no previous experience with rapamycin. I developed a strong case of shingles during my first week on 2mg. It seems logical there is a connection given that rapa is listed at the top of the heap as far as drugs that can trigger it. So..... now I am disinclined to continue. Perhaps this is kneejerk but given the low dose and that outcome hard to imagine titrating up to 6mgs. It appears to have negatively impacted my immune system from the outset. I have not had the shingles vaccine but I could do so in the future and then rethink rapa perhaps starting at 1 mg and working up. Or.....my physiology may not illicit a positive immune response from rapa even at very low doses. Thoughts??
5525,COVID vaccine and Shingles: Just reading through this interesting thread. Hope all is well with your health. Did you have anymore shingles outbreaks after the second shot? My sister in law just got it for the first time. She was vaccine and boosted. No way to tell if the vaccine was directly related but curious to see if you only had one shingles outbreak or whether this has been a recurring thing pos C covid vaccine.
5526,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had it in my early 30 s. It was excruciating. It was just a small patch too in the middle of my back. Years later I still get phantom shingles pain in that exact spot.
5531,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: So fun story I got the vaccine and got shingles when I was in my mid 20s. The odds are apparently slim. And shingles fucking sucks. I hate that you are going through it.
5539,The 2nd shingles shot got me
5542,Shingles vaccine causing horrific pain: No it did not. I had some aches and pains but that sounds much worse than me.
5545,Shingles vaccine experience: Same here Got the first installment at the same time as a flu vaccine Sore arm was as bad as it got even stacking the two. My mom got shingles so badly she was forced to retire from her healthcare job. Eighteen miserable months she dealt with complications from it. Hers was the worst imaginable case her doctor said and she never did regain full sight in the eye that was affected and she is still missing a patch of hair from one of the scalpaffected areas. I was terrified I would get hit with it before I was old enough to qualify for the vaccine. Ugh.
5551,"Hi there! I recently got the meningitis vaccine and ever since, I've been experiencing some dizziness and nausea. I'm not sure if these symptoms are related to the vaccine or if it's just a coincidence. If anyone has any insights or similar experiences to share, I would be grateful for your input. Thank you in advance! #MeningitisVaccine #VaccineReactions"
5553,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: The minute my husband got shingles I made my vaccine appointment. My father said shingles was the worst pain hes ever felt.
5556,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I have had shingles and way before I was 50.. then got the vaccine since it came be reoccurring. Get the
5565,Follow back if you please. You DO NOT want to get this affliction. I implore every eligible human to get the vaccine. I Am 5 months after initial onset attack and still suffering nerve and light sensitivity issues. Shingles is every bit as brutal as advertised.
5566,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I am vaccinated and had shingles in my early 20's.

5576,"Six Most Effective Natural Ways To Get Rid Of Shingles Without Any Antibiotics: Shingles (herpes zoster) is a viral infection that causes an agonizing rash. This viral infection is caused by the varicella zoster (VZV) infection, or, in other words infection that causes chickenpox. If you had chickenpox as a youngster, the shingles infection lies lethargic in your system. Yet, the infection can reactivate sometime down the road and cause a shingles rash. The rash can happen on any piece of your body yet commonly only influences little sections... [***readmore*** ](<url>)***:*** [<url>](<url>) <url>"
5578,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I Have had shingles in my 30s. It was horrific pain very much like a pots flare where you cannot sleep cannot focus. I Have begged for the vaccine but you have to be a certain age. Yes Id get the vaccine and deal with a possible flare from that rather than getting shingles again.
5580,"After getting my second shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, I've been feeling on top of the world! No side effects to report, just a sense of relief and gratitude for being fully vaccinated. Here's to a brighter, safer future for all of us! #JNJProtects ????"
5583,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Please please do not wait to get vaccinated. I waited procrastinated really on getting vaccine. Then too late as I developed shingles which turned into a complicated mess. Mine came out on my face and in my eye. The hell that my life has become is indescribable as my facial nerves have been impacted. They call it The Suicide disease as the pain is too much to bear. I am crying as I write this as my face throbs and just burns. Get vaccinated
5587,Finally out of my flare loving rinvoq more than I should as it is not a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: I am on Rinvoq now however two years ago when I was on Humira I got shingles. I was working on a new construction home in the summer and could not figure out why my hands arms and chest were burning so bad I thought I got some insulation stuck in my work gloves until I got home and changed out of my work clothes. Big yikes.
5588,Pretty long term side effects in ears curious if anyone has also experienced: I have had shingles multiple times and am now on daily antivirals 1000 mg for the foreseeable future. I seem to be unable to combat the continuous viral infection on my own. My shingles are always above my neck though sometimes the sides swap. I can tell you that when I first got shingles I read in a chat room a post from a woman who got it on her eardrum and even with continuous treatment got a major flareup every six weeks. It takes reading other people's stories to realize how lucky I am. Even with that if you have not been to an ear specialist go now. And your lymph nodes can definitely swell with shingles but it could also be caused by an allergic reaction to the antivirals. Also if you are taking Gabapentin for pain that could because the swelling sometimes happens with anticonvulsants. I wish I had the wisdom you need to think through this but for sure see an ear specialist and possibly an allergist to ensure you are not allergic to valacycloviracyclovir. Good luck
5591,Tell me about your vaccine flares: I have now had Covid three times all within a small time frame after the booster one resulting in longCovid. Never experienced Covid before the vaccination and both the vaccination and Covid make me feel exactly the same. I will definitely keep that information in mind for the future and appreciate your care and concern
5596,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Fellow parent of an RSV hospital baby I second getting the vaccine. My son got it in September so its certainly not a cold weather only virus.
5597,I am worried about all vaccines is it good to get Shingles vaccine? My friend got shingles  it was so painful
5598,Cleared after 4 years: I have persistent high risk HPV and after progressing to adenocarcinoma in situ in my cervix I had a total hysterectomy. Then after a recent Pap smear of my vaginal cuff which is what I have after my cervix and uterus were removed they found abnormal cells in my vagina. I started taking all the supplements AHCC Pervistop Papillex probiotic and I also got the Gardasil 9 vaccine just last week. Thanks for sharing your story. It gives me hope I may be able to clear HPV some day before it gives me vaginal vulvar anal or head and neck cancer. Perhaps one day there will be a therapeutic vaccine to help people who cannot clear it. I Am really tired of this roller coaster.
5606,Shingles vaccine: My arm was sore no big deal.
5607,GenX Shingrix: My first shot sucked and I kept putting off getting the second then totally forgot about it. Now its a year later  Is it too late? Everything I have read online says its ok if its later than 26 months just get as soon as you can. But a year later  will it still work?? I hate to make myself absolutely miserable for a few days again if it will not even do anything at this point.
5613,"Have you experienced shingles after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine? I recently developed shingles two weeks after my second Moderna shot, and I'm feeling apprehensive about getting the booster. Any tips on preventing shingles or minimizing the risk of a recurrence?"
5615,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I can hear her brother norm.. Cooking up jokes right now
5617,Get it. You do not want shingles. Make sure you take a day or two off after getting both 1st and 2nd dose. My Mom and friends who had shingles had lingering side effects for months after they had shingles.
5620,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Oh yeah I did not want the fire blisters. Got vaccine right up.
5621,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: I had both shots. Both times I felt fine. No noticeable issues
5624,I am genuinely scared of covid now.: Oh yeah I Am definitely in the broken predatory US insurance system. I was lucky to have mild shingles the first time when I was in Germany because they at least gave me acyclovir cream to put on the rash to help them go away more quickly. It was 2 euros. The second time I had it I in the US and it was a lot more miserable and they were like nothing we can do just wait it out. And acyclovir over the counter is way more expensive here. Germans do have a charming name for it though grtelrose or rose belt. And my doctor insisted I stay home from work for 5 days wrote me a note for work. The last time I was sick in the US and told my manager I could bring in a note from my doctor he laughed.
5633,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 68 got it at school like everyone else did then. Remember that shingle vaccine is not covered usually until you are 50 or so. Its a two part shot and the side effects were the worst I have had for any vaccine. I got shingles at 45 and it was no joke. You can get shingles multiple times and that was enough to scare me into getting vaccinated. One of the most sustained painful things I have ever experienced. That reason alone is enough to avoid getting CP if you can.
5634,41 and got Shingles: I had it when I was 17. It was right in the center of my back. It did not hurt all that much. There was some stinging and it was very itchy.
5635,Was this really a thing?: Me too First time was mild but the second was so bad I still have a pock mark scar on my shoulder. I am nervous about getting shingles.
5637,Shingles vaccine: I probably should not throw this into the internets but... whatever. I had an X who would have accidents which hurt me or damaged my belongings more often than what happens normally. One day she had a fever blister made a hesitation move as if she was about to lean into to me and then came in for a kiss. I KNEW that if I turned by head she would plant one right on my lips with a followup of Oh you moved and I was going to kiss your cheek on the other side. So I just froze. SHE KISSED MY EYE. A few days later i noticed a spot on my cheekbone and another one on my eyelid. A day or so later the pain started. Then it became full on sandundertheeyelid pain. The lesions had grown and the one on the eyelid was actually on the outside and inside of the lid. The optometrist gave an Rx for an antiviral and drops which 100 dilated the eye for several days. My eyeball had white blood cells floating in it but luckily no lesion on the retina. So what does an eye do when sick or damaged? It waters. That drains into your nose. Now a person has bonus fever blister in their nasal passages. I would not wish that experience on anyone except maybe my X.
5639,First Time w Shingles really struggling: If there was ever a reason to take a pause from school this is it For me the combination of the pain and the medication made me really dumb. Normal day to day stuff was just kind of hard. Could Not imagine trying to learn new things or defend opinions in school. Make sure to follow proper medical advice regarding the location since its near your eye. You want to avoid Ramsay Hunt. My first diagnosis was at urgent care and my follow up appointments was with ENT and they also prescribed Prednisone for me. So you may need something like that too. You may need to see an eye Dr too for something for your eye. Check with a doctornursepharmacist for what to take for pain and to not overload yourself. I have an iPhone and used the medicine tracker to watch for interaction with meds. My opinion is your long term health is most important. Ask your medical provider for a note to give to your school and let your instructors and academic advisor know what is going on. Find an advocate at your college to help you. You are so close to being done however you probably need to adjust your timeline. This is probably going to be a several months long healing process for you. And the pain will probably get more intense. So need to ride this out and take care of yourself first
5640,I m a 28 yr old M recently started the loading dose of R in vo q 45 mg on week 4 now. My GI recommended I get the shin gri x vaccine. I ve never had chicken pox as a child. I m leaning towards getting the vaccine although I did flare pretty Bad after getting the C covid booster booster. Currently doing great just a bit of urgency but no blood mucus 34 solid BMs day. Was wondering if anyone on r in vo q began flaring again after getting the shin gri x vaccine?
5641,Going To go to church and light a candle for you. I did a covid Shingrix shandy in 2022. Knocked me out for 2 days. Tried to rewatch Sopranos. Did Not even have enough energy for that.
5647,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I had a mild case of shingles this summer. It was not as bad as it is for a lot of people but it still sucked. You do not want it.
5649,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I got my first one on Wednesday and it made my a little extra tired until this morning. Arm still hurts, though. I hear the second shot is the worse one."
5656,: I HAVE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. My friends who took vaccine are now suffering from high blood pressure the question kind of imposes itself logically is it possible that these are causing high blood pressure? I honestly cannot imagine blood flow with these things and heart must be struggling. I have a friend who apart from high blood pressure for which he has to take meds now he also has irregular heart beats and has to take meds for that as well. Is it possible that both of those are caused by these white clots? He turned 49 recently. I am not sure if you heard about the young basketball coach that died recently at the age of 46 or something like that he was in prime health totally healthy and just died out of the blue he had to take shots to be able to work.
5661,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Same here. Just a sore shoulder.
5664,This is the worst pain I have ever experienced. If you are over 50 and can get a vaccine for the love of God and all that is holy please get one. If you are under 50 like me late 40 s then according to the FDA you are just going to have to take your chances. Anyone else been through this and survived? I know I am being dramatic. Whatever.
5666,"Shingles Vaccine & Tinnitus / HELP?: Agreed. I had it a few years back in my eye and face, and it was scary. I freaked out when the eye doctor told me it can cause blindness. The side effects of the vaccine were annoying, but not nearly as bad as actually having it."
5667,I def got shingles twice within a few months of each other. After a covid infection that I got while wearing a respirator from a friend who had traveled a week prior. Lucky my doc let me get the shingles vaccine which was horrible. But hopefully Ill avoid getting it again
5669,Considering faking sick on thanksgiving.: There is also an RSV shot now for children under I believe 8 months entering their first RSV season so I would highly recommend OP looking into getting that. My daughter had hers at her 6 month appointment in October. She was able to get it at the same time as her flu and COVID shots and had no reaction.
5671,The shingles vaccine sucks.: My husband had a small rash on his leg. Very small thing. It did not itch or hurt or anything. But it bothered him that it was there. He had an appointment and lo and behold it was shingles and he was on the recovery end. As far as he knew he never had chickenpox. I Have known a few other people like himshingles was less annoying than my pollen allergy.
5672,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yup. My sister and I had some kind of natural resistance passed down from our grandpa one of 10 kids time in the army and had 7 kids himself and never got it and my mom was extremely concerned that we still had not had it by the time we were in middle school and high school due to the known severity as you get older. I think I was in high school when the vaccine came out and she immediately got both of us vaccinated even though we are probably effectively genetically immune for the most part.
5673,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles 3x before turning 30 brutally painful and some hearing loss on that side. My dad got it and spent a full week hospitalized and complained of sharp pains in the affected area for about 2 or 3 years after. I will be getting that shot the first day they let me
5674,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I have had shingles twice in two years so I am getting the vaccine as soon as I can. My doctor said you may still get the rash after the vaccine but the nerve damage is less likely to occur.
5675,Shingles vaccine: My husband had shingles in his eye and must visit an optic specialist yearly due to high risk of problems with the optic nerve. Potential blindness. He got shingles in his early 40s well before the vaccine would have been suggested. Get the vaccine even if you feel like crap for a few days. Crappy few days  possible blindness in an eye.
5677,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles too at 36 yo. It was awful
5679,I am glad I took it because I DO NOT want the shingles. I know a couple of people that got them and they are bad. I can handle feeling like poop for a couple of days. Also the 2nd dose was fine. It was just the first one.
5684,PHN: Do you have arm weakness? That Is been the worst for me. I got shingles on the left side of my chest and my entire left arm is so weak. The rash has cleared up. Its been about a month and now I Am dealing with all of the after effects.
5688,41 and got Shingles: I got it at age 33 in my right eye. Thought I had pink eye and was in incredible pain. Since my optometrist diagnosed me he could only prescribe the medicine that would help get rid of it and not any pain management. It bloomed all across the right side of my face and left a scar where it indented my forehead a bit. Thankfully its healed better despite my insecurity about it and my vision returned to roughly 9095 of what it was. My guess to what triggered it? I might have gotten Covid right before it happened. I cannot say for sure I did but I remember feeling a bit under the weather right before I noticed the redness in my eye. I Have heard Covid can someone spark it early so that is why I Am connecting the two. Though me feeling sick beforehand could also be the shingles starting to happen too.
5692,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got the RSV vaccine while pregnant out of season even but I was able to find it and my OB was willing to write a prescription and we all got RSV maybe 2 months ago baby was 5 months old. Baby was stuffysnotty with a very mild cough but otherwise fine. I had a moderate cough and stuffiness and then my husband the only one of us who did not receive the vaccine in any way had a very bad cough that lasted for several weeks much longer than it did for the baby and I. I Am very glad I insisted on getting it even though it was after the season
5696,i have been on caplyta since november about two months and i am having a shingles flair up which has not happened since i originally had shingles six years ago. it looks like a side effect of caplyta could be low WBC. does anyone have any experience with this?
5698,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: No reaction whatsoever to either shot.
5700,Recently I have visited a planned parenthood for a yeast infection where they discovered one small bump. The first lady told me it was just a pimple and nothing to worry about. I returned 2 weeks later because my yeast infection did not fully clear. A different lady looked at it and told me the bump was a skin tag and then told me it was gential wart. She applied TCA and told me it would fall off and scab which it did not but it did decrease in size. What should i do to figure out if it is a gential wart or a pimple? I also have my gardasil 9 shot
5706,Healing with some ongoing pain normal?: My experience was very similar. The occasional pain still happens though not frequently about 14 months after my shingles outbreak. I am 54 and I got shingles in the same area as you did. I would had an abdominal surgery a year before and it really seems like the shingles outbreak occurred in exactly the most painful area of that where a drain had been inserted and where it hurt a lot as I would healed.
5707,I Am officially a booster junkie dimwit now. Boots yesterday and both paid for a Covid jab. Hubby has been unwell for many months with ocular shingles. USA in September Every year get it on the plane. Its no biggie not worried getting it just do not fancy it on road trip.
5708,"Shingles 2 weeks after 1st Moderna Covid Vaccine: I'm a fit 35 year old female. I'm a strong advocate for vaccination, but I'm feeling a bit frustrated by the debate surrounding shingles as a potential side effect of mRNA vaccines compromising the immune system. Two weeks after receiving my first dose, I noticed a rash on my back. Initially, I thought it was just a reaction to a new detergent. A few days later, I went ahead with my second dose. I contacted my doctor the following day as the rash worsened and started blistering. To my surprise, I was diagnosed with shingles along my back, and because it was already in the blistering stage, antivirals wouldn't be as effective. Now, on day 9 of dealing with shingles along my T5 dermatome, more red spots are emerging around my back following the nerve path. It's quite rare for shingles to manifest in this area, especially for someone in their mid-30s. Does anyone have any advice on how to prevent further outbreaks? It's been a week of dealing with blisters, and I'm dreading the possibility of more appearing along my back. The blisters coincide with the onset of pain and burning sensations. I've tried various remedies like antihistamines, aloe vera gel, lidocaine cream, tea tree oil, and alternating between warm and cold compresses, but the discomfort persists."
5709,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine as a child sibling and I were still purposely infected by my parents from a friend who had the chickenpox and ended up with shingles as a teenager. With how bad I got the chickenpox I probably would have been hospitalized or even died if I was not already vaccinated
5710,Shingles vaccine: I had both shots and they were not a big deal for me.
5712,I am a 40 F who just got shingles. I have had RA since 18 and this is my first time with shingles. I had C covid Sept 2023 so it left my system too low and now I have shingles. At first I thought I had pulled an inter cost al muscle so I took my weekly Methotrexate and Or en cia but then 3 days after really bad pain the rash appeared on my torso. My rheum a to logi st advised I do not take Methotrexate and Or en cia until the rash blisters dry out scab over which could take up to a month. How long did it take for you to be able to restart Methotrexate?
5717,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Got my first shot a few weeks ago getting the second in uh towards the end of February I guess? Got scared into it by witnessing a friend of ours get shingles so bad she is still out of work after a year. No thanks.
5724,I got both and my second shingles shot in 1 day. Hours 2436 were brutal Take it easy tomorrow.
5727,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: This is going to be gross but I had what I thought was a pimple in my ear I had used a qtip to try to feel what was going ondrain it figured if I could release the pressure the headache would go away. When I started feeling worn down kind of achy someone else could see the bump easily on top of the headache it seemed like a good time to call the doctor. I did a telehealth appointment where I just sent in a photo talked to a doctor. She caught on quick got me on a multiple meds bc it had progressed further than it probably would have it was in a place I could have easily seen what was going on. I remember being on one for multiple weeks her saying it was the one the really important one. I do not remember what it was now just that I have never been more diligent about taking a medication in my life if I did not the risk for paralysis was higher so that was fun meltingface
5728,Our roof is barely a week old and we are seeing swollen shingles along the valleys and blistering elsewhere in addition to raised shingles. Is this just a subpar installation job or will it resolve on its own. I have known someone else who had the same problem in her valleys and it never laid down. This is the 3rd roof on this house and none of the prior ones did this. We are meeting with the contractor tomorrow so would like to be an informed consumer and know what the best practices are to resolve it and reasonable. We have had our share of experience with contractors who want to do things on the cheap and this is not a cheap house. I tried to post this to rroofing but they are deleting it claiming I am spam
5731,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Even the sleep you are managing to get is not restful due to the pain so the exhaustion from both shingles and Valtrex is weighing on you more. Gabapentin takes about six weeks to reach full effectiveness so be patient with that. In my case it never really addressed the headaches plus it totally muddled my ability to think so I weaned off of it after a few months. Since you started the antivirals early you hopefully will see some improvement soon but you are in for a few weeks of this. Ice packs are helpful for many people for me it was hot showers so many I dried out my skin like a prune. But do whatever makes it feel better. However once the itching starts do not scratch. Besides scarring you risk a bacterial infection. And between us girls scratching does not really relieve the itch anyway. I started antihistamines for that and am still on them eleven years later. Your outbreak looks so painful I sympathize completely. Take care of yourself. Do not be embarrassed to go out into the world just wear a mask. With Covid cranking up again no one will even ask.
5732,RSV vaccine and antibodies: Mine got hers at 4 months along with another at the same time and she did not have any reaction whatsoever. So glad we did it Helps me have some peace of mind.
5735,Followed Thanks GS... Unsolicited side note Had the second shingles shot yesterday...not bad but not great either...
5739,Flu vaccination: I usually react to things so I have to be careful with what I eat or put on my body. I have never really had reactions to shots other than a short immune response i am unique though because ill usually react to dyes in medications fragrance in lotions etc. For the covid shot I had a pretty bad reaction  3 ER trips with heart palpitations and chest pain. Therefore after discussing with my OB I passed on the covid shot during pregnancy. I did get my other shots during pregnancy and can list my experience TDAP Just a sore arm for a week Flu Headache for a couple days RSV Loose stool and body aches for a couple days The worst was rsv but still I would say all of my side effects were very mild especially compared to my initial covid shot.
5741,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Our dear older friend has suffered from neuropathy for years. Has severe back pain. She got shingles. She said her nerve pain went technicolor. She had them for 10 months.
5745,Hi 36 years old male for the context I am really desperate about finding a solution for what I am suffering from... In 2019 I had what the dermatologist thought was shingles on my thorax. But it was a roundshaped cluster of blisters which resolved quite quickly after taking Acyclovir both pills and cream. In August 2023 I got infected by some virus after sexual intercourse that gave me pain during urination and 40C fever for a few days. After having being tested negative for Chlamydia Gonorrhea HIV Syphilis I took Acyclovir because I thought it could be genital herpes. The night following the first dose I suffered from very painful intercostal neuralgia and I woke up with a side stitch that lasted for 2 weeks and bilateral sciatica that lasted for a while too... But fever immediately stopped. Which makes me thing it was herpesrelated. Then in September 2023 I had another outbreak in my upper back similar as the one of 2019. Same I used Valacyclovir and it resolved quickly both pills and cream. And then... since January 2024 I keep suffering from burning sensations neuropathic pain with allodynia below my left arm first and then around my right hip and thigh.. which I treated with Valacyclovir because I thought it could be shingles without a rash zoster sine herpete. It stopped and then came back.. and since then I have been experiencing this burning sensation at least once every 2 weeks or sometimes more  An infectiologist prescribed me with 500mg  day of Valacyclovir but it changed nothing. I even tried 3g  day during 5 weeks without any improvement. I also had a burning sensation below my right arm which led to an intense neuralgia that lasted for 2 weeks  It was a nightmare... To finish this post I have to say that last November 2 I had another circleshaped cluster of blister appearing in my upper back without prior notice like the 2 previous ones 2019 and 2023 which I treated with Valacyclovir 3g  day  Acyclovir cream. Quick resolution even if I sometimes still feel some neuralgia in my upper back. And last Sunday something new happened  I had my classic burning sensations occurring under my left arm and then it started burning on my left thigh external side and after a few days of burning a circleshaped cluster of blisters appeared  So I now have the proof that the burning sensations that I am experiencing for almost a year now are related to a herpesvirus. It still remains unclear to me what herpesvirus it is  is it VZV or is it HSV2 that I may have caught back in August 2023 after sexual intercourse ? Yesterday I asked a lab to do a PCR on my blisters not sure if it will work as the blisters already started drying a little bit and I put Acyclovir regularly on it. Still yesterday an Internal Medicine Specialist hypothetized that this virus mutated to become resistant to Acyclovir especially because of Acyclovir cream which according to her often causes resistance prescribed me with Valgancyclovir Gancyclovir which is apparently a more efficient and more toxic drug against herpesvirus and which is extremely expensive. About toxicity she told me you are young it should be ok but I will not stay young forever therefore I am very worried about my future  does it mean I will not have a long life ?... what about this struggle against herpesvirus when I am old ? Last information  all of what happened since January happened while taking Valacyclovir 500mgday or more B12 3x 250g daily morning noon evening D3 50g daily morning C 1000mg daily morning LLysine 4x 800mg daily 2x morning noon evening... My Anti HSV1 IgG is 0.2 negative but I already had several cold sores in my life  How can I understand this ? My Anti HSV2 IgG is 0.6 negative but there again I am very skeptical My Anti HSV IgM is 2.2 youmL positive My Anti VZV IgG is 2229 mUIml positive My Anti VZV IgM is  0.8 negative And my immunology test showed a functional immune system I am not immunocompromised. So my question is  Can Famcyclovir be a good alternative for me ? As it is less toxicbrutal than Valgancyclovir  Can I try Cimetidine as a preventive treatment ? If yes what posology ?  What about SADBE ? I have read that it only a topical treatment...  What can be the root causes ?? Treating is good but.. what isare the root becauses ?  I experienced several atrial fibrillations in the past I am taking Flecaine daily to avoid recurrences... therefore my body already showed some unusual things for a young person. Could be related to stress people say. Maybe stress is the because of both atrial fibrillations and herpesvirus activations ? But I do not feel stressed... except when I have endless recurrences of course this is putting me in a vicious cycle It is still unsure for me if it is VZV or HSV I hope the PCR will work but I really feel hopeless... and very worried for my future. Thanks in advance for your help
5746,get bent you weirdo... i got shingles long before covid. vaccination works.
5748,"Back to back shingles outbreak: Around about December 16 I noticed discomfort that I thought was a pulled back muscle combined with a spider bite on my chest. The pain and inability to sleep got worse over the course of a week and I ended up going to the emergency room on December 23. I was given antivirals and pain meds but even so, the next two nights were nightmarish. I finished the course of antivirals on December 30 and by January 6 or so I would say the pain was merely a discomfort and I was able to sleep through the night fairly well. I stopped taking the gabapentin on about the eighth and I noticed around January 10th or so that the pain seemed to worsen. And then in the last two days I began noticing that same burning pain that I thought was a spider bite in the exact same spot only on the other side of my chest. I've read that one is not likely to experience a second shingles outbreak but that it happens from time to time. Only, I think that is referring to an outbreak months or even years later. How uncommon or odd is it to experience back to back shingles outbreaks as well as a possible reversal of the original shingles outbreak before it even has a time to fully heal? I feel like I am not going to be able to survive if this keeps happening especially if it happens on both sides of my chest and back at the same time. I must have some sort of auto immune disorder. I was fully vaccinated for Covid and I received the booster on November 19th in case that would make any difference. So this all began about 3 1/2 weeks after my booster shot."
5750,A friend got shingles after a high stress event and tried Ivermectin and it cleared in 5 days. No one beats shingles in 5 days My father took the shingles vaccine and got shingles 10 days later and it took 21 days to scab and clear. We should all keep Ivermectin at home.
5751,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: 47 got shingles this year. It was the worst pain I Have ever felt and it was a mild case. Completely messed up my life for almost two months.
5754,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Shingles in the trigeminal ganglion forever is a great time.
5755,I have been out pf work almost 3 weeks now because of shingles. The worst pain ever Mine started under my right arm and spread to my back and boob. I was prescribed Valacyclovir. Get your vaccine you do not want none of this
5757,The Progression  Sunday I 40M felt like I had a big pimple on the backcenter of my head that I kept rubbing.  Monday the back of my head felt bruised. I thought nothing of it and went to work massage therapist as usual.  On Tuesday my right inner ear hurt something that commonly happens if I accidentally get too much water in it in the shower. My right mastoid process was also sore and felt a bit swollen but was not discolored.  Wednesday I began feeling swollen lymph nodes on the back of my neck right side only when I normally only ever get swollen lymph nodes in the front both sides together. Resting my head on a pillow was getting uncomfortable interfering with sleep.  ThursdayThanksgiving I was feeling really run down. The feeling in the back and crown of my head felt like I would been hit with a baseball bat. There was soreness above my right ear so I took a picture of what looked like the dermatitis that immediately clears up with a medicated sulfur and menthol shampoo which I already use. More swollen lymph vessels around my right occiput. The pain had spread to my throat and jaw right side  Friday All I can do is recline in bed careful not to rest the center or right side of my head against the pillows. My right eye ear jaw mastoid and neck as well as the back and top of my head all hurt the worst they have hurt all week.  My partner sees the rash through my hair and convinces me to go to urgent care in the evening just before they close. Nurse practitioner confirms its shingles and prescribes valacyclovir. Says next time to get seen within 72 hours. I explain I had no clue I had a rash or shingles in the first 72 hours. The pharmacy has just closed so I cannot pick up the valacyclovir until morning.  The extra strength acetaminophen has stopped working. The crown of my head feels itchy and burning while the duller nerve pain seems to radiate from my right mastoid process through my head to my face and down the right side of my neck. cannot move my head or neck without pain. Old joint pains in my right wrist fingers and knee come back to haunt me. Sleep becomes impossible. Friends and family are all asleep. I hop on Reddit just to vent and distract myself from the pain until the pharmacy opens. EDIT  Day 7 Saturday The worst of both the rash pain along the C2 dermatome and the nerve pain over the trigeminal areas began. Day 1 of valacyclovir 3xday.  Day 8 In the evening after some sleepless nights I am desperate for pain relief and call my doctor's answering service. I get in touch with an oncall colleague and after all but begging a prescription for gabapentin sent to my pharmacy which I do not realize is closed. I call back and have it sent to the local 24hour pharmacy instead. I cannot drive. My eye on the affected side is watering turning my headneck is extremely painful and I have become hypersensitive to bright lights. So I get a ride and take the first pill immediately. About 3 hours later I feel it kicking in like a soft warm weighted blanket for my mind and nerves. The pain is still there but I care less about it and am finally able to sleep for 6 uninterrupted hours.  Day 9 In the afternoon I feel nearcomplete relief for several hours after a combination of 2x ibuprofen gabapentin and a lowdose cannabis oil THC and CBD taken under my tongue. When I reach the 8hour mark for the time to take the evening dose of gabapentin the intensification of the pain begins to build. The swelling of the lymph nodes on the backside of my neck start to go down but my mastoid process is visibly and painfully swollen yet not discolored or touched by the rash which follows a band along the C2 dermatome wide at the back of my head and narrow above my ear and stops there. It appears blistery but dry. It feels at times like a dog used my head as a chew toy at others like spiders are crawling on it and at others like a hot itchy sunburn. My doctor's medical assistant calls to ensure I have not experienced any loss or change of hearing or vision on the affected side. They are unconcerned about the pain.  Day 10 I awake desperate for relief again. I skip the cannabis oil and just take 2 ibuprofen and the gabapentin. Two hours later the pain is somewhat dulled but my cognitive function is markedly reduced much more so than when I first awoke and I feel incapable of feeling any anxiety. All I want to do is sleep which is not normal for me at all. My body feels like jelly. Day 5 spent mostly in bed. I still cannot pull a shirt over my head lay the back or right side on a pillow or tolerate cold air or bright light. Hopefully someone will find something here helpful. I plan to continue to update until I am painfree either because it is run its course or because I have found a treatment that works without interfering with my ability to function.

5761,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I would highly recommend it if it is affordable. I had shingles at 33 when I was 7 months into my divorce. Basically 2 weeks of feeling sick and having extreme nerve pain all over my chest and then another 2 weeks of mild nerve pain.
5766,Shingles again?: Yes unfortunately. I just got it again in the same spot as it was 2 years ago. I am lucky as it is never been very painful just a bit itchy. Get your antivirals as soon as you can so it does not get worse.
5768,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: If they will let you get it I strongly suggest you do. I got shingles at 36 and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. Yay stress..
5769,Recurring shingles on face and eye.: I had an outbreak 6 months ago and got the shingles vaccine already. My Dr and dermatologist had no issues with it.
5771,my mom got her shingles c19 and flu shot yesterday all in one go because I located a pharmacy for her and urged her to go
5774,"Shingles pain on blood thinners: 50F. I've had a fun month with splenectomy, then blood clot and then shingles. I kept putting off the vaccine and then the timing mase it hard with the surgery, so I kinda blame myself (and my newly comprimised/stressed out immune system). The shingles hasn't been so bad initially. The rash was just under my breast. I thought I'd gotten off lucky. Then the pain has started creeping in. Now the complication is that because of the clot, I'm on Eliquis, a blood thinners, so I can't take anything OTC other than Tylenol for pain. Anyone else gone through shingles on blood thinners and what other options should I explore?"
5775,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I imagine there are plenty who faint while feeling the Holy Spirit wash over them.
5777,"Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: My husband had ""red devil"" chemo to treat sarcoma 9 years ago. Before we met with oncology, he tried to reassure me by saying my chemo probably won't be as bad as his was because at least I won't have the red devil. Guess what? Red devil is part of the plan for me. BTW, nine years later, he's still cancer-free, and it's all a ""bad memory"" like his oncologist assured him it would be. He's my beacon of hope through my treatment because I've seen firsthand that there's life after cancer."
5783,Hi I Am 32F with KNDA. Two days ago I thought I had a breakout on my back that I thought were a result of sheets that needed washing. I also had increased my exercise level the past week so I thought nothing of it But today and last night it was really painful to touch. Its not itchy or numb but it is really uncomfortable. Everything i seeing online is showing me that its shingles but I Am vaccinated and never had chicken pox Any help is appreciated

5788,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I had shingles when I was 30. It was super painful. 7 years later I still have scars on one side of my forehead from it.
5793,Shingles vaccine experience: There are those of us that have an amazing immune system and hardly EVER get sick so we get a little hesitant about just jabbing shit into our arms the government says we should. Marine Corps veteran who had enough of being a guinea pig so excuse me if I respectfully disagree with your hypothesis on this matter. Also I have had 3 rounds of shingles all in the same place and only brought on by EXTREME stress so I may weigh my options a little longer on the vaccine
5795,RSV Vaccine: My baby was born in August and was given it before we left the hospital NSW this was recommended as he was born 4 weeks early so was particularly vulnerable due to his lungs. I did not hesitate and he did not have any side effects.
5796,Hi I am a white 73 M I am 5 ' 9 tall I weigh 220 lb. I currently take a blood pressure medication Lis in opr il 40 mg 1 day a cholesterol medication At or vast at in 10 mg 1 day I do not drink smoke or use any kind of recreational drugs that is already had a severe case of the shingles or as some people call it zoster several year's ago that covered the entire right side of my head that was so bad that I could not hardly see out of my right eye which is the one that has the best of vision. I received the two dose regimen with the first dose administered on 07262018 the second dose administered on 10262018. As I surely do not ever want to become infected with shingles in the future I took it upon myself to make a visit to the kroger pharmacy where I obtain my prescriptions as well as my required vaccination to start new regimen of the shin gri x vaccine. When the pharmacist discovered the most recent date of receiving the last immunization she informed me that any additional vaccination of shin gri x were not needed as the vaccine is supposed to be good for the rest of my lifetime. I accepted her answer as a valid answer but I am still rather hesitant as to whether or not her statement is actually valid or not. Thanks David
5800,RSV Vaccine: My daughter got it at a week old. No reaction If it was beyfortus there should not be a reaction because its monoclonal antibodies rather than a typical vaccine.
5802,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: So I have an overactive immune system? Oh interesting.

5808,: Is anyone who got the shots having pain in both of their legs? grimacingface
5809,Please get paps after your hysterectomy: From personal experience getting the vaccines likely helped my body clear the virus after three years of testing positive and trying everything on top of colposcopy and leep. There are emerging studies that it is effective
5812,Got menopause? You may be due for your shingles vaccine: I did it 2 weeks after I turned 50. Shingles sucks
5814,I got the shingles vaccine and warning the side effects are severe.: Vic odin e does not work gaga pent in is the only thing that helped mine I had head upper face and on my eyeball got the vaccine today I am miserable but shingles is horrific feel better soon
5816,Shingles and other Vaccines: The first shingles vaccine was awful the second not at all bad. Definitely worth it as friends who have had it said it was miserable. I just got over Covid for the second time and it was not bad at all does this mean the three vaccines worked keeping it a mild case or that they did not work at all since I got it twice? Who knows.
5820,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles from stress about 48. It was in the stomach and extremely sore. The worst thing is I gave my daughter measles at the age of 14. It can be contagious.
5823,Shingles vaccine: I skipped my COVID booster last spring because I had an activity planned the next day and the shot always puts me out for 24 hours then I simply forgot to reschedule the booster. So in June I was out with COVID for 2 weeks. lesson learned. I Am getting the 2nd shingles in a month. I Have got a degree in microbiology. I have faith in vaccines.

5830,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 33.6 weeker had it while in hospital because my 2yr old had rsv so to prevent him catching it he got the vaccine. He had no side effects the RSV vaccine basically only covers 6 months which is RSV season
5834,41 and got Shingles: You can still get it you just pay out of pocket for it. It would have costed me 250 oop but insurance covered it because Id already had shingles it caused an MS relapse and I was preparing for a treatment that would make me significantly immune compromised. Your PCP can write the rx and then try at a pharmacy. Worst case you pay for it. 250 is not cheap but manageable for most people. I still wound up with it a second time much worse than the first in fact. But I think that is because I Am unlucky and my immune system was destroyed. Most people will not.
5835,Shingles vaccine: Agree. I had virtually no side effects from either shot.
5837,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes ya feel any better I had the vaccine never had chicken pox and still have had shingles twice

5847,Hello all it is rare that I post to reddit but I am literally begging to figure out what is going on here. So since March 8th of this year I have 28F had a sort of chestsinus cold off and on. Sometimes finishing a round of antibiotics will leave me well for a few days to a week and then it starts again. I will list the specific symptoms what I have had done and a little about myself for a better picture. Full disclosure I have worked at a school since January but I wear a KN95 over a cloth mask wash my hands and use hand sanitizer frequently. I also take a ZincVitamin C tab everyday and an allergy pill. Before March when I started getting sick I only got sick like once a year. Here are my constant symptoms Runny nose Sinus pressurecongestion Occasional sore throat some weeks I do and sometimes I do not Fatigue A constant cough usually with mucus brown or white I test frequently for COVID and have also been vaccinated and boosted. I have been tested for flu and RSV and even had a chest Xray. I have yet to be diagnosed even though I Have been seeing doctors frequently. I have had 3 rounds of Amoxicillin one round of 'Doxycyc Mono' and tried just about every over the counter medicine under the sun. I really want to spend just one month illness free please advise me if you can.

5856,I had the pneumonia shot. Years ago I got a shingles shot n it hurt like hell only to find out it was not too effective. My sister had shingles so I really need to get it or themtheres 2.
5863,I am in tears writing this. I am an American living in The Netherlands and just saw my Dutch GP this morning for what I thought was a rash or sequence of insect bites on my thigh. Instead after a visual examination my GP told me that I have shinglesherpes zosterI was shocked and speechless for a moment. I asked if she could definitively confirm with a test and she said no doctors do not test to confirm HZ in The Netherlands its just a visual confirmation. I then asked her about next steps and she said there are not any I asked specifically about antiviral medications and she said those are not prescribed in The Netherlands unless the outbreak is on the face and threatening the eyes. This diagnosis does not make any sense to me. For context I Am a 37 yo female I Have been celibate for the last five years and did not have chickenpox as a childI was vaccinated for chickenpox around age 10 because I still had not caught it and it would be more severe and dangerous to have it as a teenadult. This means that at some point prior to five years ago when I was last sexually active a partner passed the virus on to me but not via oral or genital contact I guess? and the virus has been dormant in my body until now. How does one contract shingles if there is no history of chickenpox? Is shingles as contagious as the oral genital herpes varieties? I asked my GP if there is any risk of the outbreak moving to other parts of my body my particular concern is my genitals as one cluster of bumps is on my upper thigh and she said no but I Am reluctant to trust that because of the very barebones treatment I received and the fact that Dutch doctors do not prescribe nearly as many medications as American doctors do nor have as extensive treatmentmanagement plans for incurable ailments. The only treatment she offered me is a cream meant for a number of different rashes like diaper rash and eczema but is not medicated and is not specifically for shingles. The cream is meant to keep the rash and skin around it hydrated which helps speed healing. I Am so stressed out and worried now I feel I Have been let down by practitioners who should have a plethora of information and are eager to share it. I feel I Have essentially been told You Are shit out of luck by my GP. I received very little general information and no care instructions from my GP so my thoughts are all over the place and I Have crossed into fullon paranoia now. My concerns are as follows Is it possible for your clothes to transmit the virus from one part of your body to another? I Have been obsessively washing my hands all day and trying not to let my underwear pants touch the sores on my thigh as I pull them up and down when I use the toilet. When I Am showering should I avoid washing the sores to prevent spreading to other body parts? I use a loofah to wash myself and I Am worried this may be a mode of transmission to other places on my body. I know shingles can because multiple outbreaks but are they as frequent as the outbreaks from the other two herpes varieties? Does anyone know of a way to mailorder antiviral medication and a reputable source for doing so? I Am thinking of looking into Amazons virtual medical program but I do not know if antiviral meds would be allowed across international borders. Is anyone else living in The Netherlands with HZ? I would especially like to hear from you regarding how you have handled treatment. Thank you so much for any information andor supportI really need it.
5864,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I am 43 had shingles last MayJune. Still have issues with nerve sensitivity sternum to spine along my ribcage.
5868,Excuse me but the Covid vaccine was a scam. It did NOT work. I am not an vaccine I have the shingles pneumonia and others because they do work. 3 Covid vaccines and got Covid twice right after. And do not even tell me my symptoms were lessened as this is unprovable and BS
5870,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Get that shot for your baby. My daughter got it before she left the NICU. She got RSV 30 days later. She never ran a fever and her 02 stats stayed at 100. We did go to the er twice to help with suctioning but she was never admitted. My daughter started showing signs on a Saturday and was back to pretty much normal by Wednesday. Just a little nasally. One of my husband's co workers lost their 4 month old daughter to rsv that is same Monday that I was in the er with my baby. The shot does work.
5872,"Just got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the side effects are rough. Woke up feeling like I have the flu - fever, chills, body aches, the whole nine yards. My arm is so sore from the shot that I can barely lift it, and the injection site is swollen and tender to the touch. Anyone else experiencing these intense side effects after their J&J shot?"
5874,A nurse I know had her eyes destroyed after the covid shots and never made the connection. She puts miracle gro on her vegetable garden and yesterday was telling someone to get the shingles vaccine. Dead asleep. Its so sad.
5876,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles on my face that went from my ear and into my mouth. That was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I waited a year to get the shots. Hurt just a little at the site but nothing major. I am not one to get a flu shot but you bet I got the shingles shots
5880,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I got shingles around my right eye in February. Doctor asked that I get my Shingles shot 1 year from them. I will be doing that for sure. Its worth the cost.
5882,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: I got shingles on my hand at around age 45 and it was probably the most agony I Have ever been in. You do not want it.
5883,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I wish the only thing my mom did to me was not vaccinate me.
5884,Shingles vaccine: 72M I got shingles back in May I had a very miserable summer. I still have some pain on the right front of my chest. I am just waiting for all the pain to subside before getting the shot.
5886,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got it at 49. It was the worst thing I have ever had. I got vaccinated as soon as I was 50.
5888,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I had shingles in 2019 I was AWFUL AMA
5889,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Second shot was worse.
5891,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I felt shitty for a day but it is worth it. Shingles is a living twisting hell from what I have seen. Science really did right with this one.
5892,I was prescribed Val t rex va lacy clo vi r for my shingles within 72 hours of getting it. Before I took it I asked my doctor if the medication would give me c diff. I have had c diff in the past and had a fecal micro biome transplant in December for it. I have post infectious IB S so I occasionally have diarrhea and lots of gurgling tummy issues when I don t eat right. My doctor told me that va lacy clo vi r is an antiviral and not an antibiotic and that it would definitely not give me c diff. So now I m really worried because I started to have diarrhea after I finished my va lacy clo vi r and I have a really upset tummy and abdominal spasms. It s really scary thinking that the doctor was not correct and that I just believed her. Has anyone else had this side effect?
5893,Shingles vaccine: I recommend trying vaccine if you get reactions from the mRNA Covid shots. It was a game changer for me.
5894,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: 27f and I also have shingles. I have it on my left hip going into my lower left back. Urgent care doctor said its related to stress
5896,Diagnosed today.: Yes I get what I call a shingles headache. it is far more intense than any migraine I have had. I get shooting pains in my gums inner ear eye and scalp.
5897,Ocrevus and the shingles shot?: Not on Oc rev us but Kes imp ta. After my third loading dose I got shingles. I m 36 and had I known how bad shingles sucks I would have got the vaccine.
5898,41 and got Shingles: Got them right after my first COVID run. Worst pain I have ever been in. Hope yours is mild and in an airy place.
5901,Baby RSV Shot: Mine got his around 5 weeks and did just fine. Did Not have any side effects for him.
5905,Second Shingles Shot: Very good thanks it is been years later but she had issues with eye pain and light for a few years after. And she did not even have chickenpox that bad as a kid
5906,Oh hell I had friends that got and they are not elderly these are very with it people Shingles pneumonia rev and covid all at once. Told me they had to see their grandkids. Then within a week one came down with full blown shingles. A couple month later got her booster
5910,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I got shingles last year on my scalp. Was like getting struck in the brain with a frozen burning axe. And yeah every time I get a tickle on my head at all I panic now Zero stars do not recommend.
5914,RSV shot: It was only offered to us at 2 months and we did it then. Having a baby born during flu season made me nervous so I was happy he could have the vaccine.
5916,30 Day wait up in a week and having second thoughts.: I was having second thoughts as well but was definitely all for it the month wait for it I ended up taking it a week after I picked up the medication. I Am on 20mg once a day and have not had many side effects so far just dryness really. I say take it and try it out.
5920,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: shingles suck. my last round was in the eye. The vaccine may not eliminate them completely but for me it at least reduced their severity. Get the vaccine before you get it in the eye trust me.
5921,My son 3.5 years old has had a rash on his lower back and down his left since Friday. We got him in to be seen Friday and they advised to keep an eye on it. By Sunday it was much more widespread and blistering. Monday we were seen again and three doctors all consulted and decided its shingles. I Am very perplexed since he had his first chickenpox vaccine when he was one and no know chickenpox illness. Could someone explain their take on this?
5923,And I do not recall him ever having chicken pox. It does not look like he got the varicella vaccine either. I was doing a delayed schedule and I think I just kept prioritizing other vaccines. I swear I got him vaccinated but I do not see it in his records and well here we are. It is what it is at this point so I would appreciate not being attacked for not getting it. The rash showed up yesterday and he is already on antibiotics as of this afternoon. My only guess is the stress from starting school weakened his immune system? But if he came in contact with someone with shingles why would not he get chicken pox? I also just stocked up on Motrin to help him through the pain. He seems fairly okay though just complains about the pain when the Motrin wears off. I am just wondering how weird it is that he got shingles without ever having chicken pox that I recall
5925,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Just recently got my shingles vaccine . Not much negative side effects reaction at all. Feeling lucky
5928,41 and got Shingles: I had it at 35 on my side around my kidneys. Was annoying but did not bother me that much. Did not even go to Dr. Dermatologist saw the mild scarring a year later and commented that I had shingles and I just said yup. Some of these stories sound like a nightmare glad mine was pretty minor.
5930,if you have high risk hpv can you go swimming: Got a few red spots after a blowjob on my penis head and urethra that also hurt sometimes so when I went to the doctor he did a few tests and nothing showed up on tests so he suggested it could be a high risk hpv and asked me to get the quadrivalent vaccine and I did after the first dose the spots did decrease in redness though they still persist with occasional painwhich doctor says could be an immune response still two doses are left I was worried about swimming because moisture and hpv do not do well and I am uncircumcised
5931,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I just had shingles a month ago close to my knee. Honestly it was no big deal I feel lucky listening to the stories I Have been hearing. Muscle ache and fatigue on my leg a feeling like a mild sunburn then a cluster of bumps. I only went into the hospital on a whim since I knew I had about six heavy days of planting crop coming up and did not want to miss out. I had a staph infection once one of the worst experiences of my life and I was worried I was coming down with another one because I coujd t figure out the bumps. Turned out it was shingles.
5932,I got shingles in m3: Got my first gastric ulcer last year mid M2 year. Rise up gang
5933,How long is it tolerable to wait to get DMTs?: Yeah me too I Have had to get so many vaccines lately like I Am getting one every day and I am not joking. I started with the attenuated ones which honestly scared me and then moved on to others like meningitis pneumonia and shingles. Its been such a rough week and in the second week of January Ill be at the hospital every day for the second doses. I Am already feeling completely drained from it all.
5934,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Just want to add that your n1 directly contradicts the entire field of epidemiology the US CDC literally all of the published research on flu vaccines in pub med and the AMA. It is fine to make your own decisions but the answer is really clear if you know how to read clinical research. Just want to add an n 1 to counterargue your anecdote. My mom did not get my baby bro vaccinated for the flu. He developed pneumonia and spent 4 months in the NICU and almost died. My mom literally had to pick a casket for him cuz his survival likelyhood was that low at literally one of the top hospitals. He survived but he is got permanent kidney damage from pnuemonia complications and will need a transplant...and being in kidney failure as a small child sucks. So I guess... I would really recommend people look into what the CDC says and not do their research with anecdotes. Becuase for every I did not get vaccinated and I am fine story out there is also a I did not get vaccinated and my baby died or had terrible complications story too. Babies can and do literally die from not being vaccinated. Just something people should remember when doing their research.
5935,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: SHINGLES SUCK I have had shingles 3 times. The first timecwas in 1977 which I remember because I scratched through Star Wars. I was DELIGHTED when the vaccine came out........and of course they did not work on me. I have had both vaccine and got the other 2 eoisodes of shingles afterward I think the little laughing Shingles Demon that lurks somewhere in my spinal cord giggled and activated them in revenge against the vaccine Get the vaccine anyway. If it spares you shingles it is worth it. Valtrex works on shingles and chicken lox because they are also herpes virusii. Ask your doc for a script if you or your kid get then. Stepson got chicken pox and Valtrex spared him the worst of it.
5936,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: Weird. Everyone made a big stink about how painful the HPV vaccine is and then it did not hurt at all for me. The boosters did not hurt at all either I got mine back when it was a series of 3. I got tdap at the same time on the other arm and that one was very sore for days. But then when I got another tdap 10 years later it did not hurt at all. I think it is more about the slight variation of position of the shot in the arm rather than the vaccine contents. Sometimes it just lands closer to a nerve or something.
5940,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Both my grandma and dad had shingles outbreaks I knew what to look for so when a small sore spot on my back turned out not to be a zit I was at the doctors and on antivirals within the hour. I ended up with three coin sized spots on my back. The first was the size of a quarter and burned terribly. Even taking off my shirt just resulted in the air touching it to feel like fire burning. The second was the size of a nickel and hurt less. The third was about the size of a dime much lighter than the other two and did not hurt at all. Hit me in my early forties I cannot imagine how bad it would have been if I had not known what I was looking for and acted fast. My grandma died of a heart attack during a shingles outbreak. The family blamed the pain from shingles for causing the heart attack. The vaccine is nothing compared to shingles.
5941,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: The lovely pharmacist at Publix said that you CAN get shingles plus pneumoniaRSVTDAP or whatever at the same time but they do not recommend it since the shingles vaccine can knock you on your ass for a day or so and you might have adverse reactions minor to the others. So I am getting them a week apart. Guess it depends on your tolerance for feeling like shit
5943,41 and got Shingles: Got mine right after i turned 40. I thankfully had a very mild case but they still sucked. Especially after they decided to settle in my armpit
5945,Got my Shingles vaccine: The first one was roughish for me. The second one really did knock me back a while by far the roughest vaccination I have had. Still worth it to me for the protection and most people do not get hit that hard. I think mine bumped against another health issue at the time.
5947,First of all I am new to this group and I am desperate for help so if you have the time to read this and share your thoughts I would appreciate it with all my heart. I am 25F and I Have been dealing with everyday chest pain for over 15 year now. It turned my life upside down. Since I was 16 I had occasional nerve blocks with stabbing pain in my lower left ribs I could not breathe or move for a few seconds max minutes and then it went away and life continued like it never happened. It did not bother me much so I did nothing about it. But then on january 2023 it started to happen more often several times a day with every movement or a deeper breath I could even block it on purpose by twisting my torso I found out randomly of course I did not do it purposely. It felt like heart attacks and it was unbearable. I went to ER and the doctor there said its intercostal neuralgia and that I should visit neurologist. Neuro than said that IN is nonsense because I did not have an injury or shingles however I do have a herpes on my mouth from time to time altough I know that is a different herpes type. He run all the test Xray MRI all came out clean. He does not know what this is and apparently he never heard of costo I live in Czech republic and it is not really known here. After several months the accute nerve blocks almost stopped but I was left with everpresent pain on my left chest side. The pain has many different shapes stabbing dull ache pinching tightness. It is usually located on the left from my sternum and on the lower ribs but it sometimes spread to upper ribs side under armpit or even my breast which is really uncomfortable. I heave a problem to breath fully and I yawn very often. I also have a feeling of painfull knot between my left shoulder blade and backbone. I can only sleep on my back. It usually does not hurt when I sleep so sleeping is my favorite time of day yes I am feeling that bad. Sometimes I have better days when the pain is only slight sometimes it is so bad that I come home from work and just cry myself to sleep. I hate sitting in car and sitting overall is bad. I can not stand a bra. I usually am better when I wake up and the pain gets worse during the day no matter what I do. I had to stop doing all my favorite sports hiking and rockclimbing. Occasionally I still get the nerve blocking pain and I developed full panic attacks when that happens because I am scared for life altough I know its not life threatening and my mental health went to hell because of batteling pain constantly for 20 months. Now I tried physiotherapy accupuncture excersing chiropractor massages rehabilitation inflammation and pain medication nothing helped. At the moment I am on setraline to deal with the chronic pain. Two weeks ago I got a backpod and the first week felt amazing. The second week the pain came back like usual and I do not know if I am doing something wrong or it just takes time and there are better and worse weeks normally. I can already lay straight on the ground no pillows and it actually feels quite pleasant when I use it. I also do the stretches that Steve recomended and also the home massages. So my question is does this sound like costo or IN to you? And did you also have first good feeling and then recidive with backpod and it helped you over longer period of time? Thank you very much.
5952,I have been taking high doses of LArginine and LCitrulline together each morning for the last several months I am in excellent shape but recently developed a very bad case of shingles I previously had chicken pox as a child. I went to the ER and the doctors said it could be triggered by stress but I was not in an especially stressful time. The pain was excruciating the rash covered half of my abdomen and went around my side and to my back. I was prescribed an antiviral and gabapentin and spent the next three days miserable in bed. I joined the rshingles subreddit and happened to see many posts regarding LArginine possibly triggering the shingles. Search for yourself. I wish I would have gotten the shingles vaccine. It is healing but t's been three weeks and I am still in pain 247.
5956,I was double vaccinated with Shin gri x and still keep getting it. Wondering if I m getting it because of my Rheumatoid Arthritis medicine called A rava. It s an immune suppressant. Anyone else relate their outbreaks to immune suppressant s? Also I usually get it in the right side up my upper butt crack TMI Sorry but this time it s on the left and lower and touching my you know what ug gg Anyone else with recurring shingles have it switch sides before? I ve started on some leftover antivirals so hopefully I can prevent it progressing too much stupid shingles
5957,"After getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, I've noticed a significant increase in fatigue and muscle weakness. I thought the vaccine was supposed to protect me, but now I feel worse than before. Has anyone else experienced similar side effects from the Hepatitis B vaccine? Any remedies or suggestions on how to cope with these symptoms would be greatly appreciated. ---"
5959,Its better to have a mild or medium reaction to the vaccine for 2 days than get shingles which has no end date on it. Ian
5963,So for the past week and a bit I have been experiencing extreme fatigue constant headaches sensitivity to light and phonetv screens on and off fevers ear aches etc. just generally feeling like crap. Two nights ago I fake tanned and noticed the skin on my right side was feeling pretty sensitive woke up the next morning with a small rash and presumed maybe just a heat rash or something talked to a doctor that night last night thinking maybe I had a concussion from banging my head a couple weeks ago and they concluded it was shingles. The rash is more irritated today but feels generally okay just hot and sore to the touch. I picked up meds this morning that were prescribed. Week long treatment of antibiotics to be taken three times a day I Have taken the first dose so far Just curious what to expect. I Have had the non rash related symptoms for a while but the rash only showed yesterday so does that mean it was caught relatively early? Is it going to get worse before it gets better? The experiences I Have been reading online have been pretty scary so I Am just trying to be prepared for what is to come while I Am not feeling as bad. Thanks in advance
5971,Shingles vaccine experience: Thank you. I cannot even sleep now with the aches. You are correct it is done. Thank goodness
5982,"Has anyone experienced a breakthrough infection after receiving the HPV vaccine? I got the full series a few years ago, and recently had a scare with abnormal cells during a routine Pap smear. It's a bit concerning that there doesn't seem to be much data or tracking on breakthrough cases with this vaccine. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
5986,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I had shingles back in May and I can say that shingles exhaustion or fatigue I as like to call it is real. I can remember taking the trash out one day and feeling so exhausted I had to sit on my sofa and not move for several hours. I still feel fatigued at times but it is not as bad as it was back in May and June. I was even able to visit my brother and his family in Portugal for the first week of September where I did a ton of walking. I hope that you start feeling better and soon.
5987,Essential T cells: In the last 7 months I lost my wife and my daughter. My wife had metastatic breast cancer for 18 years. After a jab it became uncontrollable. Daughter was diagnosed with non Hodgkins lymphoma the week after my wife's funeral and it took her in 7 months. She also had a jab about the same time my wife did.
5989,Personal experience?: Actually an example of gaslighting. She Absolutely got sicker after each round of shots. Stop gaslighting people.
5996,i have been diagnosed with hpv: Not pregnant never have been but I had a hpv outbreak at a time where I was severely unwell  weak immunity. I had the vaccine as a teen so our situations are different. I have seen a few mums on Reddit whilst in my deep dives who have had hpv during pregnancy and their child has been fine. My advice would be to come off Reddit or at least go down the right search hole.. but to talk to as many health care professionals as possible your healthcare professionals for true advice as the idea around vaccines are very 2 sided anyway
5998,Shingles again?: My first 3 were all on different dermasomes and so were the last 3. 3 wrapped all around my right ribcage right where my bra band goes. It was the worst one I am still taking gabapentin for the PHN in one spot by my spine. 4 and 5 were on S3 and S4 dermasomes respectively. Glad I was on vacation with those although S4 hurt more to walk than sit. 6 was on my right temple area so the SECOND I thought it might be shingles I took my last Valtrex refill. Pretty much stopped it although the sta was rough for a few weeks. No obvious blisters just raised bumpy skin on a 1 X 2 spot.
5999,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had painful arm but that was it. Although very painful arm. Both times
6002,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got shingles and it was actually spread out and got in my lungs. I was in ICU on a ventilator. I Have since recovered and gotten my shots. Please do not wait. The alternative sucks.
6004,"Just got my second vaccine shot (Spikevax, Moderna) and experiencing some strange symptoms. My arm feels like it's burning from the inside out, and I've been having trouble sleeping due to the discomfort. Should I be concerned or is this a normal reaction?"
6011,Shingles vaccine experience: I got my second shot a week or so ago and was prepared to be miserable. My arm hurt less than with the first shot and I had no other side effects not even fatigue. Happy that is all done with
6016,How is it possible to get shingles with no prior chickenpox exposure?: Correct 5 years ago I had no antibodies according to the test then received chickenpox vaccine. Now I have shingles. I Am in my 40s not eligible for shingles vaccine yet. Either the antibody test was a false negative or the vaccine increased my chance of getting shingles from 0 to 1 You are right its a gamble either way. Though I have some control with respect to limiting chickenpox exposure. Anyhow there is no going back in time I just wish I had more information when I was presented with the recommendation of receiving chickenpox vaccine. My case of vaccine introduced shingles is supposed to be rare but how rare? And a related thought if the chickenpox vaccine was widely introduced in the mid 1990s in this country then those who are 30 or younger today would only have vaccine induced shingles. In a couple of decades we may find out how rare this really is and make better informed public health decisions.
6017,Sores on scalp: I also had shingles HZO recently from the top of my noggin down to my eye so I feel for you. The blisters are all cleared but my scalp still is really tender when my hair is pulled. I think if it were shingles it would not be all over unless it activated in all the nerves at once. As you know that would be EXCRUCIATING lol
6019,Yep I have had both doses. First one knocked me for a loop. Sore arm itching. But I know someone with shingles and it is infinitely worse than the shot.
6024,How did you handle Shingles besides meds?: My tolerance for physical pain is very high but this is mind blowing bad. Its on the left side of my chest and armpit brutal
6025,Shingles shot?: I have broken bones and had a kidney stone but Shingles was absolutely the most painful thing I have ever experienced and it lasted for over a week. I have got the vaccine since then because it is possible to get shingles more than once. I HIGHLY recommend getting vaccinated.
6028,Acyclovir - is it horrid?: Just been diagnosed with shingles for the second time today after a period of high stress. It's on my face so I've been prescribed acyclovir to hopefully stop it tracking to my eye. Has anyone had any side effects from this? I'm nervous to take it as the prescribing nurse said it can be nasty ??
6030,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: Shingles are very painful. I had it in my 30s and my husband is still recovering from getting it in the eye He always had eye problems but a few weeks ago he was really losing his mind with his eyes. It sounded worse to me than the usual. I was suspicious. Fortunate he had an eye appt already on the calendar. But I still regret not calling them AS SOON AS POSSIBLE and getting him in sooner. It is very dangerous if it goes in the eyes. Get to Dr. as soon as possible if itch or pain is consistent and worse than normal. Dr. says you could lose your eyesight Knowledge is power
6031,Causal evidence that herpes zoster vaccination prevents a 2 proportion of dementia cases: I would clarify something more V Z V has 2 forms of symptoms shingles you can do google images and whole body blisters absolutely whole body covered with sores. Shingles pic 1 Shingles pic 2 V Z V initial symptoms Both of these forms are caused by V Z V. I got the old vaccine since childhood and I got these symptoms later I am eligible to have shingles anytime in my age too.
6034,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: Dang that is rough I hope you heal quickly. Ice and ibuprofen helped me a little bit when I was going through it but time will definitely be your ally here For the future see if your insurance has a nurse hotline you can call When I got shingles the phone nurse recognized the symptoms and told me to get an appointment right away. She saved me quite a bit of pain Also sometimes you can message a doctor directly online and get medication prescribed without actually having to go in. I recently had some bad contact dermatitis from a houseplant philodendron micans can make some people react as if it were poison ivy and my doctor was able to prescribe steroid cream without me having to do a copay. Do not be afraid to reach out to your doctor and get medication if you are struggling with this
6035,Vaccines and Humira?: I was too young for the shingles vaccine but I got the pneumococcal while on humira and also flu vaccine covid vaccine boosters for childhood vaccines etc. It all went fine but they did tire me out a lot.
6038,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: Do you only have pain in the place you got shingles or all over? Mine went into my ear and infected my brain so I Am feeling it all over my body
6039,RSV vaccine: I got them all I spaced all mine out by a week just to make it a bit easier. No side effects from either The Covid booster was rough though but I Have never had Covid so it was worth it
6043,Believe it or not my comrades in shingles I am still scabbed from my 24 th recurrence since May 2021 and waiting for this to dissipate. I ve added in Vit D 10000 iu every day in conjunction with the LL y sine. Also CoQ 10 and a timed release Vitamin B Complex for skin and nervous system. Back to doctor next week to discuss. I can t handle any more steroids I m up 20 lbs and don t have a bra that fits and I feel crabbed all the time on the prednisone. Again I have yet to find a vi r I haven t had a reaction to anaphylaxis mostly such as the val cy clo vi r and one other that I can t recall the name of. Three different doctors have said that recurrent shingles like this is extremely rare and indicative of stress. They collectively continue to state that it s like a perfect storm of my autoimmune disorders my PTSD w hyper vigilance and the stress or s of my fathers death my husbands death many painful discoveries after his death him having no will and all the horror of settling his estate hint it s been over two years and nothing has been settled other than his family s lawyer and my lawyer tallying up the ongoing fees. I am under 50 but my doctor said I could be given the vaccine if I can remain shingle free for 34 months. I ve been averaging 1 recurrence per every 1 13 months. I m a teacher and the school system will not allow me to return until I have the vaccine. Here is the kicker Having the vaccine will not guarantee that I will not have shingles again. This journey has been very humbling. I have hypo pigmentation several scars and daily nerve pain now. Any input recommendations and suggestions are appreciated. Be well comrades.
6047,Shingles vaccine experience: Same my husband got it earlier thus year. He is a tough guy in general but he clearly suffered still gets headaches. I got both the shots when I saw how much it sucked. Considering the others flu tdap maybe even polio and measles boosters because of RFuckfaceK jr.
6048,Burning pain but not severe: I hope you do not get more severe pain. Did get you get antvirals? If not please get to a dr as soon as possible to get them. They work best when started early. Mine is about a month in and it mostly feels like a sunburn still but some days are shockstingling pain or aches like getting punch in the stomach. My rash is still there but very light. It is itchy and causing me trouble sleeping still. I think I have had one full night's sleep in a month. Mine started on my back and wrapped to my right front torso. Good luck
6054,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: The hardest part were the scabs that fell off leaving craters. I had chunks of my forehead missing. I Am Asian though and many of my friends were 1st generation immigrants. The scars were a collective trauma bonding since it was something we all shared in common. Many of us also have the scars from the smallpoxBCG vaccines received as young children.
6056,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Had shingles start out at top of my head. Started out feeling like a headache but never had pain on the crown usually temples. Pain got exponentially worse in short period of time and felt like someone was taking a cold blade and inserting it into my crown and slowly pulling it out. They were concerned it could come and hit my eye and thankfully got seen by ophthalmologist the next day and was cleared. This is no joke. Had Covid early before doctors were testing for it and again last year. Pain and discomfort level is a 5 and the shingles pain is a 10 out of 10
6059,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got my vaccine early this year and also happened to get shingles in decmber. I do not think getting Shingles had anything to do with the vaccine causing it or anything it is a myth that vaccines because the disease they are for and they were too far apart anyway. I got the vaccine because an old friend of mine got them and I thought oh I do not have the vaccine I should probably get it. Anyway I did get Shingles because I am from the generation that parents thought forcing you to get Chicken Pox would prevent Shingles dumb asses. My case was hardly severe and I did not even know I had it until my rash scabbed over and I noticed it was in a line behind my ear. It tingled a bit back there but did not really itch much and I think I only noticed it when I did occasionally touch it after it scabbed over and I could feel the scabs. It lasted maybe a week after that and did not because any permanent nerve damage like it can. I personally thank my lucky stars I got the vaccine because I think they would have been way worse if I had not. And because Shingles rarely happen twice mine was mild AND I had the vaccine I am pretty sure I can say bye to them forever. So yeah that is my experience with the vaccine. Oh yeah and I was born in 81 I am 42 this year when I got the vaccine and the very mild case and I am convinced that while the vaccine did not prevent it entirely it made it a breeze to go through so I am glad I got the shot.
6060,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: 3 days after my first gardasil 9 shot mine disappeared but after 15 month they came back. I Am going to go for the 3 shot dose so hopefully they will go
6065,Maternal RSV Vaccine Too Close to Delivery?: I was late to get the vaccine got it at 37 weeks and then bloodwork that same day showed cholestasis setting in so I was whipped in for an induction. As others have said because the interval between me getting the shot and baby being born was so short there was no time for antibodies to transfer so baby was eligible for the monoclonal antibody instead. I was glad I got the shot though any additional protection from RSV even if out of season is much appreciated especially since I have a toddler as well. It sounds like you will be in the same boat eligibilitywise.
6071,"Join the club - I (33/F) am another person experiencing an outbreak about 2.5 weeks after my second Moderna shot. I received my second dose on May 10th, and on May 26th, I noticed the first rash bumps appearing. At first, I attributed it to a skin reaction from a new body wash, but as it continued to spread over the next few days, I became increasingly concerned. After some online research, it became apparent that this may be related to the vaccine. It's reassuring to know that I'm not alone in this experience, as I've come across similar cases on social media and forums. Stay strong, fellow post-vaccine rash warriors!"
6078,Shingles vaccine: The vaccine was contraindicated with my diagnosis. I ended up with shingles which left me with an open wound the size of my palm on my inner thigh. I spent weeks wearing skirts and trying to walk like my thighs did not meet. 1010 pain level. Now I have a hideous palm sized scar. TMI I am sure.
6079,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: The ground is one helluva drug
6082,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: I have had two bouts of Shingles and its not fun. Every move you make just hurts like a different kind of hurt nerve ending hurt. I am not old enough for the vaccine I have been agruing over it with health professionals in the past. I just do not want it ever again.
6085,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles a few years ago a small patch on my back near my shoulder blade but just slightly out of reach. It was awful. A friend got it on his thighs between his legs. It hurt him to walk.
6086,I am devastated. Thought I was Graduating this month. Instead we are waiting another 2 months to TTC because I need a vaccine booster booster. After having time over the holidays to read up on preconception and listening to an ebook I realized I needed to check up on my vaccination to make sure I was up to date. I knew I had the Chicken Pox Varicella vaccine as a kid but I could not remember when I had the MMR vaccine and heard of people losing their immunity immunity. These vaccines are important because both Chicken Pox and Rubella the R in MMR can because severe birth defects. So being the anxious worrier I am I asked my doctor to put in a lab order for a tite r test. Surprisingly I still had MMR immunity but I was no longer immune to the Chicken Pox and would need the Varicella vaccine again apparently these only last 1020 years. Ok fine. Thought it would not be a huge deal to get a shot. BUT not only is the Varicella vaccine a 2 dose shot given 46 weeks apart it is also a live vaccine. Because of this we need to wait an additional 28 days after the second dose to TTC according to the CDC. Actually my doctor advised we should wait 3 MONTHS after the 2nd dose to TTC. But that is an overabundance of caution and I have heard other people say their doctors said 1 month was fine. And it probably will not even happen the first month. I just feel so anxious like I am running out of time. already 33 and this is our first baby. Considered not getting the vaccine but I knew I could not do that. If being a parent is all about tough decisions. this was my first one. I got the 1st dose yesterday so I will be hanging around in WTC limbo for a while longer. Still have to quit v aping anyhow which I put on the back burner because of this vaccine fiasco ugh. Just wanted to share with you all so you can save yourselves from possible devastation when your time comes 3 x 200 B TL DR Some vaccination require you to wait at least a month after to TTC so best to check up on your immunization beforehand
6087,I had never heard of the term shingles before the coronavirus vaccine was released. The only thing that could happen is the coronavirus vaccine. Why do not you accept it? If you do that you could seriously die or suffer serious aftereffects. Antivaccination people are doing fi
6090,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Thanks for this I got allll the vaccines and RSV was honestly the easiest in terms of side effectsnot even arm soreness for me. I am so glad to have done whatever I possibly could to protect my baby from such a debilitating illness in her first weeks of life.
6091,Mine lasted for about a month. I was really sick. I am never bothered by vaccines either. I have read that the 2nd dose is much worse so I skipped it. I will take my chances with shingles.
6094,Shingles at 35: I was also diagnosed w shingles at 35. I had just gotten over an upper chest thing. My dr said it was most likely due to stress low immune etc...they came on my torso. Right rib cage. I also endured the horrible jolting pain a few months after. I have not had that intense jolt in a couple of months however I do have throbbing pains that are very random and honestly now i am struggling with the god awful itch that you just cannot get to. I had then mid November and its almost the end of March. I hope you get all the way over them soon And congratulations on your wedding
6096,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: It was rough but totally worth it.
6099,"A chiropractor I used to work for constantly shoved it in our faces that he was a ""doctor"": Not sure what to tag this as or if this even belongs here, but here we go. I wish I knew about this sub when I got my first job working for a chiropractor two years ago. I've been a long time lurker. It was a small clinic owned by a husband and wife who were both chiropractors. God these people were awful. Aside from the fact that they constantly berated us, and reminded us how worthless we were, these people were on a massive power trip. Here are a few instances I can recall. - One time the wife asked me to vacuum the office 15 minutes before they opened. Before I started vacuuming, the message therapist (who was always so kind to us) suggested I start vacuuming the office from the front and work my way to the back, that way I wouldn't be in any patients' way. Makes sense. When both chiropractors saw what I was doing they started screaming at me and reminded me that my coworker was ""just"" a massage therapist and to listen to the doctors because after all, they are more intelligent. Ok. Whatever. I started vacuuming from the back and sure enough, when I got to the front of the office I was in patients' way and they screamed at me and called me an idiot. - I witnessed the wife perform acupuncture on multiple occasions without disinfecting any of the patients or needles. - They were too cheap to replace any of the electrode pads (not sure what they're called) so we REUSED them, without disinfecting them mind, you. I finally called them out on it when a patient told me she just recovered from shingles and the wife called me stupid because you guessed it, she's the doctor and I'm not. She claimed I had no idea what I was talking about. - Another thing. These people were anti vax. A patient came in and was mourning her father who had just passed. The wife said ""he got the covid vaccine didn't he?"" and rolled her eyes. (WTF) - Their daughter (by the grace of God) got into medical school and the school required a covid vaccine. They wanted to sue the school, they rescinded her acceptance and now she's blacklisted. Morons. - And last but not least. The husband needed to order an MRI for a patient and asked me to call"
6102,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles very bad. Got the vaccine. Got shingles twice more once in the roof of my mouth then the bra line all left side. Awful.
6104,Varicella vaccine post COVID?: Starting a new job in 2 weeks and my varicella titer came back that I wasn't immune. I am day 10 post COVID infection and don't feel comfortable getting a vaccine right now. Am I being ridiculous?
6113,when did you realize you were old...: Threw out my back got shingles and had gout all within a year. Old hit me like a hammer. Its been pretty good after that rough patch though.
6119,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles in my mid 30s it was not that bad. It started off with a couple of bumps on my back I assumed were zits. It got more itchy so I went to the drs and got the diagnosis it was shingles. It was just about 72 hours after the first onset but I got a rx for it anyway. It spread to a full blown rash across my back but never hurt. Took a couple of weeks to clear up. I Have also known people who got shingles early one at 17 and another at 25.
6121,I am a 44F with hypoglycemia hypothyroidism migraines and allergies. I am 510 and weigh 160lbs. I Am on ozempic hypoglycemia control xyztal allergies montelukast allergies topiramate migraines levothyroxine thyroid and Wellbutrin migraines. I have had this issue several times since I was a teenager but I am concerned it is being misdiagnosed. Every time I have gotten it I was told I had shingles due to stress and given Valtrex or Acyclovir and it goes away in 2 3 days. At the time of first occurrence I was not sexually active in any way. I am also vaccinated against shingles and have had the chicken pox not once but twice first time was minor second time I had a very severe case. Over the years this issue keeps showing up and its the same song and dance but I do not know if I creating bias by telling the doctor what happened the last time. I have it again yes I was extremely stressed leading up to this and was put on Acyclovir. Usually its giving some indication of clearing within the first 24 hours and this time the bump is just getting larger. A poorly taken photo can be found
6122,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Have you had the first one yet? I got mine last Friday and barely even had a sore arm. Fully expect the second one October to be worse but maybe not. Seems like some folks do not react at all.
6123,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I have had shingles three times. Thankfully all three times were mild. Around that time I was to young. When I reached the age to get the vaccine I did. If I remember correctly I believe it was two shots with a specific timeline between them. My first hurt like crazy. However after getting the second one I believe it was the pharmacist that gave me the first one. I experienced no side effects either time. One thing I learned a long time ago is to always get your shot in your dominant arm. Righthanded get your shot in your right arm. Same for left. Because you use your dominant arm often  it never really gets soar.
6124,I just noticed these bumps on my inner thigh near my testicles. They do not itch but my testicles itch a little...feels like jock itch like I have had in the past. Again the bumps do not itch. I did shave about ten days ago but other shaved areas do not have the bumps. Any clue as to what they are? Thank you so much in advance. 57M 6' 210 already had Shingles vaccine. Rules said include a link for the photos
6132,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yes its a bad one but from experience shingles is a nightmare and the shot is worth it.
6134,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I think I predate this. But I know my mother was glad when I got chicken pox and literally said good to get it out of the way. Since then I have had painful outbreaks on my mouth with scarring and shingles.
6136,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Ohhhh. Nooooooo That sounds awful I had it when I was 27 and I think it was brought on by early labor since I gave birth a few days later. Speaking of vaginas though I was prescribed valtrex since herpesshingles are cousins and treated essentially the same and I had to keep explaining at the hospital that no I do not have genital herpes never had ANY herpes since extra precautions need to be made since herpes is bad for babies I had shingles in my eye and that is why I was taking valtrex. I was met w skepticism since it is not very common. Its funny now at the time not so much. I Am sorry about your experience So glad for the vaccines and fuck shingles
6137,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Shingles can be ungodly painful. F feeling you are old. Get the shot My sister is only 54 and she has it. Started in the nerves in her bottom teeth. Spread to her ears neck face and head. it is been about 5 weeks and all the sores are gone but she is still struggling with nerve pain inside her ears. do not walk run to get your shot.
6139,"PSA: Vaccinated? Yes, you CAN still get shingles: Did you get the shingles vaccine too? Mine was only the size of a 1/2 dollar and scabbed within a week. I just feel sunburnt in different areas on that side of my body now. I read a study that reported a huge rise in cases of shingles and herpes zoster in Latin American countries with drs stumped but starting to look at shingles as a delayed activator. Glad you are doing better friend!"
6141,I Do Not Know if this matters but I had my Period during the colpo. Pap was lsil. Just freaking out a bit. HPVHR but neg for 161845. I have a hx of 1618 years ago that cleared. Vacccinated with gardasil original vaccine RESULTS Specimens Submitted 1 Cervical biopsy 11 of the clock 2 Cervical biopsy 5 of the clock 3 ECC Final Diagnosis 1. Cervix at yeah 1100 biopsy  Ectocervical mucosa with reactive changes 2. Cervix at 500 biopsy  Ectocervical mucosa with reactive changes 3. Ectocervix curettage  Endocervical mucosa with acute inflammation and extensive squamous metaplasia Thanks
6148,Has anyone else gotten a covid booster AND shingles at the same appointment?: I Have slept for most of the day and was finally feeling a bit better but i feel like its coming back. I Am really hoping the worst is over because its been a rough 24hrs
6149,Shingles vaccine: I am sitting at home now with the shingles and it is no fun. I shit you not even my hair hurts.
6151,Rinvoq and Shingles: I get reaccuring shingles about every 4 months like clockwork. RA meds are taken so that your body slows down an overreactive immune systemergo the shingles virus has free rein to wake up and make an already miserable life more miserable. This started when I switched from my tnf blockers to the JAK inhibitors. And yes I did get the vaccine.
6153,Shingles vaccine experience: I was 33 and it was truly miserable. The treatment was a Capsaicin rollon. I have an abnormal pain tolerance apparently and it was a debilitating experience regardless.
6154,"""Hepatitis vaccine aftermath - looking for input"": Hi all, I had a pretty tough time after getting the Hepatitis vaccine and now I'm feeling anxious about getting the shingles and pneumonia vaccines. Has anyone else faced challenges after these vaccines? I'd love to hear your experiences and any advice you have to offer!"
6155,Shingles at 22?: 32 and I Have got it. Have the sore throat and headache with back pain it wraps from my spine to my chest. I thought it was just an allergic reaction to new laundry detergent because no blisters at first. Figured the sore throat and shit was from going back to smoking cigarettes for about two weeks But my gf told me the rash is bigger every time she saw once it showed up. Saw a nurse practitioner today and she took one look and said it was shingles. I Have had the vaccine a long time ago but here we are. Not going to take anything to see how bad it gets. As of now its itchy like a healing tattoo but sometimes feels like a spoon is scooping my muscle out but only for a second. The rest of the time its just itchy enough to notice it.
6157,Shingles vaccine experience: The shot itself was painful but besides a slightly sore arm nothing for me. I get my second shot next month along with TDAP booster.
6165,Back again.: After the vaccine I did not have to continue the antivirals. The vaccine only lasts 5 years. I got mine over 10 years ago. I thought I was in the clear but a few days ago I was diagnosed again. I did not get another vaccine because I thought it was a one off situation but now I know it is not. So I will be getting it every 5 years moving forward.
6166,Shingles vaccine: I got it at 50. No side effects. I had shingles at 46 on half my face eyesmouthlipsears affected etc and facial scars to this day After I returned to work looking hideous bunch of coworkers and even a family member told me they had it before and some had it really young and they had it anywhere from 20s60s.
6167,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I got my shots. I still get shingles. Sucks
6168,Anyone used antiviralsacyclovir while suffering with LC?: Thanks for sharing. The allodynia is so strange Felt like my entire thigh was bruised but no bruises. Then it would jump around to smaller areas on my hip and groin. I hope whatever he decides that the shingles passes quickly. Like we do not have enough to deal with it feels cruel to get shingles on top of LC.
6173,Vaccines: I am just getting over shingles. I hit a month on Wednesday and my symptoms are still bad sometimes. I had a severe case but it was by far 10x worse than anything MS has thrown at me and knowing what I do now I would have given anything to get the shot back when I had the chance. I have never been in so much pain in my life. Vaccine side effects can be bad but most of the time they are very much better than the actual virus.
6178,Any idea what this is? Not itchy but hurts when rubbed wrong: OP I hope you don t mind what follows is a copy pasta I share with everyone who posts here with shingles. I don t want anyone else to ever have my experience with the disease. Even if you are prescribed antivirals to shorten the duration of this outbreak please make sure that you get vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated. The vaccine is called Shin gri x. It s two shots taken about a month apart and the rate of effectiveness is almost 90. I m immune impaired TB and I had almost no immune reaction to the old Zo st a vaccine which means of course that my body didn t learn how to fight back against the virus. I had regular outbreaks for years and still have residual nerve pain mostly in my face. Technically it s tri gemina l neuralgia which is very painful and very permanent. Luckily the Shin gri x shots triggered a strong immune response and I haven t had an outbreak since my second dose. That s why I ve made it my mission to tell anyone and everyone about the vaccine. No one should have to go through that kind of pain. It s so irritating to me that there are docs who will just give an R x for Val t rex. It shortens the current outbreak but doesn t stop successive outbreaks from recurring. And the more outbreaks you have the more likely you are to have permanent nerve damage from the virus. I m so sorry you re dealing with this. It was just under four years of regular outbreaks for me and I got my first Shin gri x shot the first day it was available to the public. Don t let that happen to you. Good luck and I hope you ll be feeling better soon.
6181,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles when I was in my early 20s. I do not remember the pain of childbirth but I remember the shingles pain. Like someone holding a belt sander to my hip. It recurred for months after the rash went away.
6182,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I can still taste my polio vaccine. Ugh.
6187,Shingles vaccine experience: I got a tiny batch of shingles. Tiny. The size of my pinky. And omg it hurt SO much. I went straight for the vaccine after that
6189,PSA To try and quiet anyone else's nerves before going. In preparation to start on CIBIN QO I just received my initial jab of the shin gri x vaccine. I am happy to report that it was NOT painful felt much like any other vaccine C covid flu etc. After having been told and reading that others found it particularly painful I had been feeling slightly anxious about getting it. Hope posting this will help any out there with a fear of needle.
6193,Shingles vaccine: Knew a woman who lost sight in one eye from shingles. Had never heard of it before that and was grateful to learn there was a vaccine. Hubs and I both got ours. We both felt like crap the next day and had to take a day off. Otherwise no issues. Would rather have one day feeling crummy than risk the consequences of shingles
6194,I had shingles once..the shot was worse.
6196,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had shingles when i was 43. It is indeed horrible. Imagine someone heating up the tail end of a metal pen and then randomly pressing it into your skin. The pain is intense immediate random. I took two medications one being lyric a and that in itself is horrible. I tried to continue work while taking the medication but lyric a would because me to zone out midway through sentences. I would forget what i was talking about and just s it there for 30 seconds. I am turning 50 soon so i assume now it is time to get vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated.
6197,Am I being a crazy FTM?: My baby is 20 weeks on Monday and I Am with you momma. I just started taking her out to the store but I am so worried about her getting sick still that I have not let any of my friends around her yet. Just my immediate family. She received her rsv vaccine at her 4 month appointment. I know I Am not ready yetI feel like you know when you know
6199,Shingles vaccine experience: Second shot is worse but nothing compared to Shingles.
6200,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: My friend got shingles ON her 50th birthday and it caused permanent paralysis on half of her face. Needless to say I went out immediately and got the first vaccine and the next when it was due. Do Not mess around with shingles. It can be very serious
6203,"Where can healthcare workers or medical students avail cheap TDAP, MMR, varicella vaccines?: Looking for places in Metro Manila that offer vaccines at cheap prices for adults. Need Tdap, MMR, varicella, meningococcal, flu vaccines. Thank you"
6206,I do know people who have had a reaction to the shingles vaccination but that did not deter me. I also know people who had shingles not worth the risk.
6207,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My son got it at maybe 36 weeks and most was sleepy for the day
6208,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have a friend who got shingles two years ago it affected her eyesight for months and she was also miserable from the pain.
6212,I got both shots as prescribed and only experienced a sore arm. Everyone I know who has had shingles says it is a terrible experience the shot is far preferable.
6216,"Just had my Johnson & Johnson shot a few days ago and now I'm dealing with a strange rash that resembles chickenpox. The itchy bumps are all over my back and shoulders, and some have even popped and blistered. Has anyone else experienced a similar reaction to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?"
6219,Shingles vaccine experience: I was sore but nothing unreasonable.
6220,I was so lucky to have gotten the Shingrix vaccine a few months before Covid I was up to date on boosters too so my experience was 2 days of symptoms then resting up with a 5day course of Paxlovid. And yes I know how incredibly privileged I wasam Was masking then and now
6223,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: My husband went to our local health dept to get it when he was 46. His older brother got it and it migrated into one eye it was quite painful.
6224,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Same only the left side been hell ever since
6225,Recurring Shingles with Ulcerative Colitis?: I Am going through my first bought of shingles day 23 and I have UC. I Have seen the derm twice and finally yesterday she agreed that its atypical shingles on my scalp and forehead without a red rash and blisters running along nerve but showing up as swelling and lumps and severe itching. I do take meds to suppress my immune system so once I get through this and am shingles free for a month I Am getting the vaccine. I too am in remission but it definitely makes me wonder if its all linked
6226,Got covid last week. Was tired for a day and arm was sore but no real symptoms. Got flu shot yesterday and no issues so far. Getting shingles shot in 23 weeks.
6227,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Does Not matter what vaccine it is I feel anywhere from lousy to terrible afterwards for up to two weeks. I never ever get two at the same time. I plan it out so I have time to get past the side effects.
6229,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Eh I got the vaccine and still got chicken pox so I would not stress anyway. Luckily I did have an incredibly mild case
6230,First time with shingles is this normal?: Yup has something similar. Rash on my upper right back which then caused a small rash on my right chest and a sore right armpit and lymph node. My arm felt like I had been working out but I had not been to the gym. Also the burning was so strange like it was burning from within
6233,33f went to urgent care because of rash turns out its shingles: Thank you night time has been the worst for me so far with the intense itching. After reading everyone is comment and I scrolled through the page I went and got some calamine spray lidocaine patches.
6234,Second Shingles Shot: I had almost no side effects from the shingles vaccine. I usually do not experience much beyond injection site soreness with any vaccine I have had and I have had all of them. Unlike the tinfoil hat crowd that our new HHS secretary belongs to I trust vaccines and have my entire life. Because of vaccines smallpox has been eradicated. Smallpox has killed millions and now due to vaccines it no longer exists.
6236,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles in my mid 20s and did not see a doctor until it was too late. They told me if I had it checked out earlier they could have given me an antiviral to prevent it from getting so bad. I had to wait it out and let it clear up on its own and was told I could be left with nerve damage. It started as a rash on my inner arm near my armpit and eventually spread over my shoulder and down my back. It itched and stung so freaking bad and was VERY uncomfortable. It cleared up on its own but I have some small scars on my arm and nerve damage in my back that still periodically itchesstings. I wish I was aware of all of this sooner and hopefully people will at least be aware of the signs and get it checked out sooner than I did.
6238,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: Me too. Lots of difficulty getting out of bed and I can't satiate my hunger. I'm hoping these pass so will give it a bit longer."
6240,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: She is alive. Fractured her skull when she fainted.
6242,Noterrible thinghad just seen my doc in Nov for the yearly. He said get the Shingles vaccine do not want to get shingles. I got the flu shot pneumonia updated COVID Promptly forgot the Shingles vaccine voila 7 mos later I get Shingles. I should have gotten it FIRST.
6243,Ill try to keep a long story short but I Am a 35 year old male in good physical shape who has never been sick outside of the minor colds and flu. But about 2 years ago summer of 2022 I got sick for a few days with what I believe was Covid this was when that second wave hit and I just isolated and never actually tested myself. After getting sick I experienced chronic hives for a solid year. They would occur daily and in different spots to the point I was taking a daily antihistamine. During this period I also got a bad case of the shingles again I Am only 34 at this time. The doctor theorized that something was going on with my immune system and that it had been weakened as evidenced by the hives and shingles at a young age. After about a year of Zyrtec the hives stopped. Around the same time the hives stopped I noticed a small lump swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck in the collarbone area. After a few weeks of it not receding I went to the doctor and they ran the basic blood test. Everything came back clear. They advised me to keep an eye on it and come back if it got larger. Fast forward 3 months and the single lump is now several with the largest and its large think like half a tennis ball upper neck kind of behind my ear. Concerned I go back to the doctors and they run a litany of tests chest xray super in depth blood panel ultrasound of the lumps std test etc everything came back clear. No lymphoma or cancer markers. Also no lumps in the other problem areas like the pitts or groin. I Am beginning to feel like i belong on doctor house. I Have web MDed myself to death and the number one thing I keep seeing is hydration will help drain them. I am someone who works outside and plays a cardio intensive sport so I am dehydrated pretty consistently Last week I started drinking close to a gallon of water a day but am looking for any other suggestions. I Have seen lymphatic messages and several products that advertise at lymphatic drainage aids and teas. Are these snake oil? Or any specifically worth trying. TLDR got sick 2 years ago. Hives for a year with a nice dose of shingles sprinkled in. Once hives stopped several large lumps appear on one side of neck but nowhere else. All doctors tests came back clean. Advice besides drink water on products or methods to encourage swelling or restrengthen what appears to be a compromised immune system. Thanks in advance
6244,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I had both with absolutely no side effects at all. Not even a sore arm.
6246,I Am only 33. First round of shingles covered my entire left armpit got infected and had an allergic? reaction to the anti virals causing another rash from nose to knees.. all of that went away. New itchy blistery rash all over my fingers forearms chest face thighs. Now I have this 1st picture second shingles rash. I also have bruising 2nd pic I cannot explain. There Is more on my other leg. Anyones elses shingles come with other odd bruising or rashes? PCP said she does not know what it is Cannot get into a dermatologist until 1.5 weeks
6247,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Had shingles got a vaccination a year later that made me very sick. Nothing since and no more vaccine Sucks either way.
6253,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 86 had it twice before age 4. Currently dealing with nerve pain after being diagnosed with shingles at the end of March.
6254,Is the level of varicellazoster virus IgG associated with symptomatic status of genital herpes simplex virus infection? A casecontrol study  Bret S. Palmer Alan Tang Stephen Winchester Mark Atkins Simon Barton Peter Kelleher 2023: Not sure what studies you are referring to but I took V Z V vaccine because of this study from 2012 and later found out Jacqueline Le Go aster who was part of that study did not in form about her clear conflict on interest about her having patent of using V Z V vaccine for HSV 1 HSV 2 years before this study. So if you read the PDF of that study from link I provided sentence The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work. is BS. They used Var il r ix and Var i vaccine in that study and some people only had one dose. I took two dose of Var il r ix live attenuated back in 2013 and did not help me at all. I took 2 dose 6 months apart a standard they use for chickenpox in my country. Can you give me a link to the study you are referring to because I could not find any study where they had used three V Z V vaccine dose 2 months a part.
6257,Shingles vaccine: None at all. Flu like aches but nothing like the actual pain from shingles.
6258,Shingles and other Vaccines: I would rather be uncomfortable for a day or two from those vaccines than suffer like I Have seen relatives do with those diseases. I feel under the weather for a day or two with those vaccines but its so worth it when the alternative is so much worse.
6259,41 and got Shingles: Despite my parents efforts I never ended up contracting chicken pox and then I got a shingles vaccine when I was 35 or so. There is a shingles vaccine and it is a bit late for you but everyone else should probably look into that...
6260,Big medical day today. Doctors visit attempted blood test 2nd shingles vaccine flu vaccine Covid jab next week a months worth of drugs from the chemist. Blood test failed because my blood pressure was too low they could not find a vein. Minor issue with my kidney function.
6264,"Joint Pain and/or Nausea after the COVID-19 Vaccine: A notable trend is emerging where many individuals are reporting the onset of joint pain and nausea following the administration of covid vaccines or boosters. Some are grappling with joint discomfort for the first time, others are experiencing a resurgence of previous joint issues, while some are battling persistent nausea. This unanticipated development is causing distress, apprehension, and a reluctance to proceed with subsequent vaccine doses. I too find myself in a dilemma in this scenario. I had intended to receive the booster shot, but I have been plagued by chronic joint pain for 9 months post my initial covid shot. Consequently, I am hesitant to move forward and am seeking more information to make an informed decision. It's a challenging position to be in - not wanting to risk contracting covid, yet not wanting to endure the ongoing joint pain or worsening nausea. As per my understanding, the manifestation of joint pain/nausea is not a direct side effect of the covid vaccines but rather a consequence of the immune system being occupied with producing antibodies, potentially triggering joint pain or exacerbating existing nausea due to immune system strain. If anyone has resources or personal experiences to share that could offer insights into joint pain and nausea post covid vaccinations and boosters, please contribute in the comments. Let's compile a repository of articles, videos, or remedies that may provide guidance or relief to those affected.

6265,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Had it in my late 20's. Relatively mild but still awful and more physically debilitating than I would have thought. Doc said it was brought on by stress. I had a weird outbreak of awful psoriasis on my neck that same year. Same because according to my doc. Neither have ever recurred and I am almost 47 now. Shingles was terrible. The rash was not as bad as I have seen on others but the pain and fatigue was intense. I lost my job no great loss lol and had to rely on my thenpartner for a lot of support. Care not to repeat. Not sure about the vaccine at 50 not vaccine at all just not sure if doc will suggest based on history. Guess those of us with lots of cancer in the family and the genetic markers to also be more likely to end up with one version or another are sometimes suggested not to get the shingles or lateinlife HPV vaccine
6272,Baby RSV Shot: My baby got it at his 4 month appointment no side effects what so ever. I was thrilled to get him the RSV shot I wasam so scared of him getting RSV.
6274,Shingles second vaccine: I have not had the shingles one but my consultant recently told me that immune suppressants can get rid of our immunity for chicken poxshingles. Was like why did I go through all that pain as a child I had get the pneumonia one recently omg my arm never been as swollen in my life was crazy.
6276,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: You can get shingles even if you get the chicken pox. I Have had both do not recommend. I have a wicked shingles scar on the side of my face
6277,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I got shingles last year. And it made me REALLY mad i did not get the vaccine. It was really painful
6278,Getting conflicting information of migraines vs. CH either way I got shingles from it: The rash is on my back and over my ribcage no facial lesions knock on wood. I will be the first to admit I am a total worry wart. When looking up different peoples symptoms with shingles not a lot of people mentioned the headache was bad more so how painful the rash was. Only the back rash is causing me discomfort like I got stabbed by a knife back there. I guess time will tell with me either way I have so much sympathy for this community. I have been dealing with this for a few days and it is awful I cannot imagine years. You all are solid
6279,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: Turned 50 and got the vaccine. As I understand it, its efficacy is around 10 years, and for the life of me I can't find anything about guidance or recommendations once I am in my 60s. Does anyone know if there is a booster or studies on getting the vaccine again or whether it's not necessary if you're already vaxed?"
6280,My pain started Sunday and I thought it was appendix but it radiated to my back and so I was thinking kidney stones. Rash popped up on Tuesday on stomach where the pain first began. I saw my doc Thursday morning who diagnosed Shingles. Prescribed Hydrocodone Vicodin for the pain. First dose took the pain away. Each subsequent dose has done NOTHING. Prior to seeing the doc I tried a 225mg Pregabalin which knocked me for a loop but did take the pain away. I know it is specifically for nerve pain so now I am wondering if my doc has me on the wrong med. The Pregabalin is the old dose my roommate no longer takes but I was desperate to stop the pain. Has anyone found Vicodin works for Shingles pain or should I just call doc and ask for a switch in meds? Thanks
6282,Shingles and GenX: I have had shingles and it sucks. The pain is worse than even getting shot. It is like bare nerve endings being grabbed by tweezers painful. I was humbled by the pain I got lmao.
6284,If I do not have shingles will the antivirals hurt me?: I know everyone is experience is different I have not experienced the pain yet just seriously intense itching. Like claw my skin off itch. Thanks for your reply it is not fun at all.
6285,I am not sure how much my wife accepted from the infos around but even after she got shingles she did not believe it was after the vaccine Fortunately I was not alone in that her best friend refused the vaccine and she agreed to test every day instead.
6288,Its a cover for the rampant shingles and side effects from the vaccine in my opinion
6289,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Thank you for the now PSA for the shingles vaccine
6293,Questions about getting vaccinated: I get vacinated because i have lung issues I will get two at once but will not get 3. Made that mistake got my RSV COVID anf FLU at the same time and I suffered for a couple of days. I have family think it is a lot of huey. But also has had covid a number of time. So it each person opinion. But i have a real issue with nonvacer's bringing back rubella mumps and measles those are dangerous diseases.
6297,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am pretty sure I got the shingles vaccine when I was 1718. Id never had chicken pox so I got the shot. This would have been around 2012
6298,I think my smaller mom would have done better with a smaller dose. I think she was overall glad she got it because her younger sister got actual shingles which was tough. She is more sensitive to certain medication like anesthesia drugs. She ended up being okay but it was rough
6299,Shingles vaccine: I had a mild rash and not a lot of pain but the exhaustion with shingles was horrific. It was 6 weeks of ultra low energy. I could do things in small bursts before having to sit down exhausted. Get the Shingrix everyone
6301,RSV vaccine?: Also if they recommend a vaccine please get it. My friends bub had her rotavirus vaccine and still caught it but would have been SO much more sick had she not and she was still hospitalised for 3 days and lost SO much weight and still has not recovered fully. They do not just recommend them for your bub to not get sick it is also for herd immunity which keeps everyone else safer too including babies who might have conditions that make it so they cannot get vaccinated.
6304,RSV Shot: we got it when my LO was like 1 or 2 months old and it was such an anxiety reliever honestly. she did not have any negative reactions.
6305,Shingles vaccine experience: My grandfather had such a terrible case of shingles in the '90s that he took his own life. My mother had them a year ago and still has terrible residual nerve pain. I have had the shots and I encourage everyone reading this to do the same.
6306,"Diagnosed with Shingles M35: Your coverage area seems identical to mine. I'm 11 weeks in, tapering down Gabapentin. I did drop a bit of weight initially, I think I just didn't eat as much due to feeling like crap. My nerve pain is much better but it was tough sledding there for a bit. Good luck!"
6308,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Yes I had it about a month ago. It was on my scalp ear neck and shoulder. Typically it stays in one Dermatome but I was lucky and had it in 3.
6310,Shingles vaccine experience: My mom had shingles at 35 and they thought it was bone cancer because of the pain she had a very mild rashalmost invisible. I Have had so many younger friends mid 30s getting it from stress reducing your immune system that I was NOT messing with that. I got chickenpox at age 14 and that is the SICKEST I Have been besides scarlet fever another throwback disease. I got my 2 shots
6312,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles when my twins were newborns. It was the most intense agonising pain I Have ever experienced. I love that for Trish.
6316,Hi I do not know anything about hpv so I Am trying to be educated. I had both hpv vaccines before the age of 15. Since then I have had enough partners that I can count on one hand. Recently I tested positive for ureaplasma and I Have been wondering about stis. I Have had full std panels before and been negative but I Have never tested for hpv. If I had the shots and I have no warts or anything do I need to test for it? I Am asking because I read somewhere that ureaplasma and hpv have a correlation but I have no clue what that means.
6319,Vaccines: I have heard that Shingrix can be tough I typically have a bad reaction to the COVID boosters but I still get them. I think they work because while I have had COVID once spring 2023 it felt like a mild cold. So I will keep getting them I guess even if it takes me out for a day afterwards.
6320,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You need to look for a different doctor or for free clinics.
6321,My eyes ears and nose were areas of severe blistering. I have scarring and permanent nerve damage. The last 4 times I Have had antivirals and steroids for my eyes. I Am 6 months clear and I will pay for the vaccination. Please everyone be aware Shingles are revolting 22
6324,Shingles vaccine experience: My sister got shingles and she was considered lucky that she only experienced the blistering rash  it went up one side of her body and up towards her face. She said it was one of the most painful things she is experienced in a long time  you better believe I got the first dose the week I turned 50.
6330,RSV Shot side effects?: Yes but it did slowly get better over those 10 days. If it was getting worse I would definitely go see the doc Also I have never had any reaction to any vaccine before so I was surprised. I think this new RSV one is just a little more reactive for some people
6336,32M I was diagnosed with shingles 2 weeks ago starting with a backache then came the shock feeling over my spine then a long painful rash from my lower back to my front stomach. The doctor said it was shingle. After 1 week of living with painkillers ibuprofen and paracetamol as prescribed the rashes started to heal and they turned to dark scabbing spots. A day ago I found out that more rashes were forming in the midsection of my back right above the old rash and there were some individual red spots on the other side of my body. I am a bit confused since I know that there is a very rare case of shingles that spread over your body. Today I can see a lot more spots all over my stomach on both sides and also on my arms. Came to see the doctor again and she told me it looked like I had chicken pox. My question is can chicken pox appear after shingles? Or is it another form of shingles that spreads over your whole body? I have included a few photos for reference.
6338,"Dealing with vaccine reactions can be concerning. I had a similar experience with the flu shot a few years ago, so I understand your hesitation. Have you consulted with your doctor about your concerns regarding getting the second shingles shot?"
6340,That Is understandable and you have my sympathies. Unfortunately even though medicine is not a crap shoot it does still play to the lowest common denominator. If you lie outside that group life can get risky. Here Is a pic of my reaction to my first shingles shot.
6342,I have also gotten 11 covid vaccine Doing excellent now also after recent 3rd vaccine flu and shingles with massive SE in short succession. I almost wonder if it matters which vaccine it is as long as immune system is distracted.
6344,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Just went through that last week both first and second were rough for 24 hours second was slightly worse. It lasted a day and faded.
6346,Shingles vaccine: I got the two shots in 2023. I decided to get them because I have two siblings that experienced shingles. It was not too painful or sore. I figure it was better to prevent than actually getting the sickness.
6347,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got it during the beginning of COVID. Presumably brought on by stress of the pandemic and trying to salvage my business that shut down for months. Seemed pretty mild it was itchy and a little painful but did not spread too badly.
6350,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: No thanks my army is tough it does not need to know how to locate identify and fight this particular enemy Dude my dad lives with 247 pain all over his body from long COVID. He was near death. I do hope you get lucky in whatever shots you do not take. I know you are going to want to talk back at this but save your time I am unfollowing this thread so I will never see it
6352,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: Chiming in to provide a different experience that will hopefully lighten the mood. I got shingles about 6 days before a HIM last year. I Am not sure if it helped but I caught it early and got right on meds quickly. Big ass horse pills. I ended up racing with them and was fine. Only real trouble I could remember was the deep rooted torso pain on entirely one half of my body. I did a test OWS two days before the race to feel it out and was alright. I think the takeaway here like most things are that everyone is different and it will depend on how you feel. You know your body best. FWIW I am fairly young so I aside from dealing with the pain it was not a huge detriment to health. Oddly enough my shingles triggered pityriasis rosea about two weeks later. Just hives all over your torso. It starts with a herald path and then grows to body hives days later. Be on the lookout. Hope you feel better. Sorry that this is happening.
6360,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had them on my face and in my ear. It was awful. Get vaccinated you definitely do not want shingles. It felt like I was getting stabbed on the side of my head every few seconds for days.
6363,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Me too 1954. Got it in grade school and my Mom pinned tube socks to the sleeves of my pajamas so I would not scratch or pick at them. In 2011 I started to itch around my right side and a slight rash. I thought uh oh shingles. Went immediately to the doc and he put me on two different medications I think one was a steroid. Fortunately he said by coming in right away I was able to stop it from blowing up into shingles. I was lucky.
6364,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Just had my first one last month and it was a little tough. Had a few people tell me the second one is a doozy Guess I will take a couple of days off work for that one
6367,Shingles vaccine second dose: I had zero reaction to either shot other than a sore arm.
6368,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I am currently in my 3rd week out of work. I have shingles affecting my forehead and eye. it is the absolute worst. I am sorry you are going through this as well. I hope you see some recovery soon.
6371,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I am getting the first dose of the vaccine tomorrow so I will be sick for Mardi Gras weekend facewithrollingeyes . I also had mild shingles a couple years ago just a rash on my sides that did not bother me much but I hear the horror stories so I am doing the vaccine.
6377,I think it was my 3 vaccinations in a matter of a few months that probably did it. First was my normal booster for the broad range and Tetanus etc. then had to wait for a few weeks after that for first C19 shot then the booster after that. Then the shingles hit FYI
6379,Shingles vaccine coffee: I just got my first shot and I Am seriously wondering if they slipped a placebo in on me because I had absolutely zero side effects. I read about what other people went through and I Am guessing either the 2nd shot will kick my ass or they are shooting me with straight saline.
6380,"5 days of abdomen/lumbar allodynia before small rash appeared, 31yo male shingles: Yes I should take second shot. But I still think the first shot caused my problem. Here is what a news said:Although clinical trials didn't report herpes zoster reactivation involving the skin as one of the side effects, two case reports mentioned typical skin rash of herpes zoster that occurred a few days after Shingrix vaccine.Jan 31, 2023"
6381,Not my baby: My daughter spend a week in the ICU with RSV. She was vaccinated against it but its never 100. I was terrified every day and wed done the sensible thing and vaccinated her. Some of these people will kill their kids and I just cannot imagine how they will feel when they realise.
6382,I Am 33 weeks pregnant and a FTM. Yesterday I had a growth scan and they thought my baby was in distress because of his breathing patternsheart rate. He would breathe rapidly and then normal and his heart rate would spike to 170 bpm. His heart rate has often been around 137138 bpm at appointments. They did a nst and said he seemed fine with his baseline being 155 bpm. I was given the rsv vaccine and sent on my way. Yesterday afternoon I felt super exhausted and when showering had to get out as soon as possible because I felt extremely weak like I was about to pass out. I ended up throwing my dinner up then. I have not thrown up since but I Have had a fever of between 100.4 and 100.9 for 24 hours now. I Have also had extreme body aches where I have been struggling to walk around. I Have taken Tylenol every 6 hours kept a cold rag on and have been drinking water but have had no luck reducing my fever or body pain. I ate some chicken noodle soup and drank a rapid hydration Gatorade today. My concern is that all of today I have not really felt my baby move. I Have felt maybe 2 weak movements by him a few hours ago. Its definitely a big change from his typical patterns. Is this normal with a fever? Or should I be going in to get checked out? I guess I feel worried since just yesterday they did an nst.
6385,First time getting singles on my forehead eyelid and scalp any tips for face wash and healing?: Thank you so very much reading this felt like a big hug. I Am sorry you have gone through this too and that you know EXACTLY what I Am going through. Road flares in the jaw is the perfect way to describe that shooting searing pain I will be sure to drink more water do not think I Have been drinking enough and set alarms to take the meds on time I Have been taking the Prednisone between 710am every morning with food and the Gabapentin and Valtrex 3x with meals that vary in time throughout the day. Thank you for the things to watch out for and be mindful of. I Am sorry that you are still experiencing itching so many years later and I hope it fades at some point so you can have more relief. I will do my best not to scratch and am offering Cetaphil now. Right now it hurts to even have water run down my face and I thought about not showering or washing my face but understand its important to keep the affected areas clean. Thank you again and wishing you all the best in your healing and recovery too
6386,While we are discussing side effects which is usual I should let you know about herpes flares most varieties of herpes. I have been HSV1 since very young I do not remember a time without cold sores. They were under pretty good control as an adult with avoiding sunburn wind chapping and eventually acyclovir as needed as soon as I felt the tingle. I tested for HSV2 genital herpes about 15 years ago and was surprised to find out I am positive as I would never had lesions and anyone I was in contact with since about 1998 had been tested as a part of usual STD testing. I assume I picked it up from one of my first 3 partners before that and just never knew. Anyway After I started rinvoq I started getting persistent cold sores and even genital lesions so I looked up side effects and sure enough it can because an increased incidence of both but it is not one of the more common side effects. This might include other herpes like shingles. So now I take a daily suppression dose of acyclovir along with my rinvoq. If you note that you are getting more HSV outbreaks you might want to tell your rheumatologist.
6387,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: Mine got it in nicu around 37 weeks. She was just more sleepy than usual though that also could have been from having also had an eye exam that day.
6388,Several vaccines associated with reduced risk of Alzheimers disease in adults 65 and older. Vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria with or without pertussis herpes zoster shingles and pneumococcus are associated with a reduced risk for developing Alzheimers disease.: Is it painful? Other sensations includes soreness tenderness relentless itching numbness. Hypersensitivity all od yn iq
6389,Had shingles on my forehead and scalp: Thanks Fortunately I Am doing well now I also had the same pain along my jawline too and all my lymph nodes on my right side were inflammed. Thank goodness for the antivirals indeed I was lucky that I followed my gut to go to the clinic to get checked out. I work as a nurse so most of the time when I do feel something I brush it off lol. I was just so shocked I could get it so young but I guess I was recently stressed about my wedding prep too so that may have caused it. And I Am also considering getting the vaccine too I never want to go through that pain again omg it was the worst thing I Have ever felt. Hope you are doing fine now as well and take care
6394,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I had both shots. Sore arm for a couple of days but having seen a couple of friends get shingles Ill take the sore arm over the shingles.
6395,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: I was so worried about my second Shingrix shot but it ended up being fine. I was surprised. Mild symptoms lasted a day. I got it midmonth so as to space it out between Cosentyx injections.
6397,"Getting two vaccines at once: Oh my, I've heard those blisters are excruciating. I'm sorry you went through that."
6399,: Is this going to happen to me? Am I ever going to be an old man? How long do I have left? Those clots remind me of that bookfilm The Andromeda Strain. No more vaccines for me. I stopped in Oct 2022 Moderna. In March 2023 I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. I was a healthy middleaged American and ultra endurance athlete.
6400,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I got shingles at 20 due to Crohn's and being on Infliximab. You really do not want shingles. Bleeding oozing pox going down my right hip and leg. Very painful as well. It can because lasting nerve damage but luckily for me I did not have any long term effects just a really sucky week or two. The vaccine came out when I was around 30 and I got it as soon as I could. That is the other fun part is you can get shingles multiple times.
6402,Got Arexvy last Tu V glad I could get it. Shingrixlevel soreness not pain in deltoid inj area w palpitation for about 2 dy. Dy 3 mild. Dy 4 today fine. No issues. Have re vx self for everything over last 112 years wo probs Shingrix was upper end of discomfort range. 1
6403,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Same here. I was told the TDAP shot would be rough but had zero reaction not even a sore arm.
6404,RSV Shot side effects?: I Have never had a reaction to a vaccine before until this I Am glad i am not the only one My SIL got it last year before her baby was born and thankfully she did because the two older kids got RSV right before she had baby Thankfully her and baby never got it but it was kind of scary last year at this time
6405,Shingles vaccine: I got the two part shot last year. I felt fine both times.
6406,"""Had a rash after my second Johnson & Johnson shot a few months ago, hesitant about the booster... Hello all! I developed a rash after getting my second Johnson & Johnson vaccine a few months ago. I've been contemplating getting the booster shot, but I'm a bit apprehensive due to my previous reaction. I'm afraid that I might experience a similar skin reaction if I proceed with the booster. Can anyone share their experience if they've been in a similar position and went ahead with the booster shot? Did you encounter any skin issues post the booster? Any input would be greatly appreciated!"""
6408,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: My brother and I are fully vaccinated but he got shingles in his 30s. It was very difficult for him because he is also special needs. It bothered me so much and how could he have gotten it. He cannot talk but he cried a lot.
6411,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yeah its not a good time. I was a single father and working in an office. I frequently had to walk around helping my workers. Moving around. Caused a burning stinging pain. At least when I was off work I was just relaxing and did not have to move so much.
6412,I just had my first shingles shot. I was all prepared to feel miserable bc of the stories I Have heard but I had 0 side effects which is unusual for me. I Have always had side effects from vaccines. Now I Am wondering if I received a dud. lol The 2nd shot will probably be awful.
6414,I had my last headache injections 6 weeks ago. Then I lost my main source of income. Got my COVID booster. Then I got lyme disease. Then I got shingles cellulitis. Now I am back with my headache injections again lol. 6 weeks was a long time for me this time
6417,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: It did not feel like I lost much at the time. Mine took like 2.5 weeks overall because my outbreak was like TMI the top of my butt crack and like my right cheek so for me i was better once everything healed externally and I could deal with the little sharp stabs from time to time lol
6420,Want to pop my shingles going crazy had the shot but that was 4yrs ago my doctor told me I have to get another shingles shot.
6426,Shingles and other Vaccines: I know someone who got shingles in her eyes. She had to be put into a medically induced coma. My sore arm was worth it.
6427,"How long does this sharp pain last?: The lidocaine patch (5%) didn't help the pain in my back when i tried it after the first ER trip, but I also couldn't fully get it in the right spot by myself. I hadn't tried it again since I thought it was the cause of the rash. Is it safe to put on top of a rash to try it? I have only a few spots on my back where the pain is, most of it is on my side. They did say to follow up with my PCP on Monday and see about getting Gabapentin from them. I really don't know why they gave me oxy but not a nerve pain med. The oxy doesn't touch it."
6428,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: If you had Chicken Pox then you have shingles right now its just dormant. Once your immune system weakens enough it can start attacking your nerves. I had it about 10 years ago it felt like I had broken my ribs.
6436,A rare case: Hi 33F here. I also have never had chickenpox and was vaccinated for it as a preteen. Just diagnosed with shingles on Thursday. Man that really shocked me Started with painstiffness like a pulled a muscle but it was my whole right leg. Took me a couple of days to notice a rash on the right side of my butt then a day later I noticed some in the middle of my lower back and the next morning there were some blisters on the front of my thigh. I thought it was an allergy at first but I was so confused cos its all parts of my body that are always covered too. Started on antivirals Thursday evening and finally finishing day 3 but its still been spreading a little around the original areas. Hoping its not going to be a recurring thing too cos my baseline is being quietly stressedoverwhelmed due to burnout from work. What a wake up call I know the antivirals are supposed to help with potential longterm effectscomplications so its good you got some anyhow Wishing you a swift recovery.
6444,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles about 14 years ago. It was the worst medical experience I Have ever had and I have lupus and had to have a kidney transplant. My skin was so sensitive that the movement of air from to my partner passing me in the hallway hurt me so clothes were a nogo for a minute. I developed Post Herpetic Neuralgia which means that the pain did not subside as it usually does when you heal from shingles. The pain is marginally better but I cannot wear certain things and I take a few things at night so I sleep oh and I can only lay on my left side as a blanket touching my left hip is unbearable.
6448,I had shingles twice very small patches. First was a friend invited me over for coffee then informs me she had shingles. I was pied woke up 2 days later small rash that stung. Second was after the flu shot I needed because of your heart. Last time I received any sh0ts
6449,Lower leg lesions: I got a granuloma annulare from the vaccine it looks quite similar to your lesions. It started out small exactly like yours and now after a few years it is about the size of a billiard ball.
6450,I had no reaction to my first shingles vaccine jab
6451,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got the vaccine as soon as I could. Not that bad mild flu like symptoms.
6453,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Me and my roommate who got covid had like shooting neck pain for a day or two when we were sick. No vaccines for me though.
6454,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Sadly my second was as bad as the first but I scheduled it for a Friday afternoon so I could take off work and sleep.
6457,Shingles: I got shingles a few months before I was first diagnosed with lymphoma. No rash presented just a band of searing pain from my belly button to my spine. It felt like someone wrapped a redhot cable around me. It was excruciating I could not wear a shirt for a week I took Valacyclovir Valtrex twice daily during treatment and had no recurrence of Shingles. I have had a recurrence of lymphoma which I am currently treating and I have been taking Acyclovir twice daily during treatment. So far so good.
6460,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: My wife got it at 38. Miserable for months. They should just give it to anyone who ever attended a Chicken Pox party.
6464,Shingles Vaccine Side Effects: Hi there. Wondering if anyone has had swollen lymph nodes for a few weeks after getting the shingles vaccine. I have one after two weeks and i'm starting to get worried. Thanks!
6467,24 AFAB I have mild rheumatoid arthritis but do not take anything for it. Moderate use of my vape but no smoking or drugs. A few days ago a coworker came into work with shingles. He spent maybe 20 minutes around me and was sent straight home. I have woken up with what looks to me like a tiny rash on one cheek. No other symptoms I feel absolutely fine but knowing I have been around him and knowing I have big plans this week has me a little freaked out. I have also never had chicken pox or anything similar. I have not changed detergents soaps etc and cannot think of any reason why this would have appeared on my face. Does this look like the start of chicken pox or shingles?
6471,So I recently have developed this clear looking very tiny bump on my hand. I cannot tell if its a wart or not. I had plantar warts as a kid and I also got the hpv vaccine both shots. My situation ship has a wart on his knee that hes had for 12 years we cuddled he had shorts on and I had a thin layer of pants. Could I get a wart from that on my thighs or something.
6480,Monkey Pox originated in the less than 250 people who came to hear Kamala in NC and the thousands that showed up in PA for Trump. The terror from that reality caused shingle reactions in all the Covid jabbers from the Pfizer shot stress induced shingles.
6481,Crikey getting shingles after shingrix that is just suck.
6489,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: It hurts. Flu shots do not hurt at all. This one does.
6490,Its bs. Its a cover up for Covid vaccine Shingles or autoimmune blister disease or herpes. Pics of my friend after vaccine
6491,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Oh good thank you Yes the shot itself was not bad at all. And now I get to eat ice cream. smiling face
6492,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: OMG. That Is a full on nightmare. I have some nerve damage from a surgery and get phantom itches ALLLL the time. They Are unscratchable and it makes me bananas when it happens. I can only imagine how awful a cast would be. I Am sorry Yeah it might be shingles vaccine time for a lot of us.
6496,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I only had 3 chicken pox blisters on my back as a child. When I was 30 I got shingles. The first blister was in my eye and I almost lost my vision. Did Not show on my skin until a month later. I did not have the electrical shocking you described but I definitely did not have a regular reaction.
6498,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah my mom did this to me. Now any time I have a viral illnessnesslike the cold I break out in shingles a few days later. I Have had so many outbreaks I Have lost count but I know the signs and symptoms. Thankfully the outbreaks are not bad enough now to warrant a valtrex script. My first 4 outbreaks were brutal. I am also on Ozempic and the combination was brutal. I had diarrhea for like two weeks and had to work to get my gut biome back to normal. Thanks mom.
6500,41 and got Shingles: I get them at times of severe jobrelated stress. I am 47. I had singles last year and also back in 2009. It is some of the worst pain I have ever been in including broken bones or the time I hurt my back. I need to get the shot now that it is more widely available.
6501,SFN biopsyconfirmed. Secondary Raynauds orthostatic hypotension and slowed GI. Extraordinary tinnitus. Thanks simultaneous shingles and Covid. Despite the pain I refuse to give in and have lost 42 lbs from JulySeptember by being very strict on dietcaloric intake as well as working out. If I have a bad day I go out for a run or hard workout and try to push myself beyond the limit. It infuriates and probably scares my wife and kids but I Have told them that this is my way to say FU to SFN and if I blow my heart up so what. In any case I Am getting IVIG 2gkg over 2 days every month now a stronger dose since I Am down 42 lbs to 192ish lbs and I Am still getting 180 gms. While I do not give a crap about other periods I do wonder if working out real hard on or shortly after IVIG days might reduce its effectiveness. I do have fatigue postIVIG so what I tend to do is workout before day 1 and go for a brisk walk after day 2 IVIG. I get that I am thickheaded but if any of you have thoughts on this Id be curious to hear.
6504,Shingles vaccine: Oh no I have to get my tetanus updated soon. I do not remember the last one being that bad but I did have a concussion at the time from falling on the ice.
6506,Unfortunate News Eurocine Vaccines: No NDA reported on GSK there is some members posting updates here about GSK But they mention still having OBs after the two shots of the vaccine I can remember only one guy enrolled in moderna's trials that has reported his OBs fully stoped since his second dose of the vaccine His username is Geeked or something.
6508,"45 yr old female diagnosed yesterday: Hi everyone, I'm a 45-year-old woman who was diagnosed with shingles yesterday. About a week ago, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my face, similar to a mild sunburn. A few days later, I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine. Following the vaccination, my symptoms worsened - I developed a rash on my forehead, felt a decrease in energy, and experienced swelling on my face. Yesterday, I visited the doctor and was prescribed Valacyclovir for a week. These past two days have been challenging, with discomfort, loss of appetite, and low energy levels. The sores from the shingles have started to dry up and ooze. I had chickenpox as a child, which can lead to shingles later in life. The doctor mentioned that in some cases, vaccines can trigger shingles by affecting the immune system. While my symptoms had already started before the vaccination, I wanted to share my experience to raise awareness. I'd love to hear from others who have gone through a similar situation."
6509,I got shingles about 2 weeks ago started with horrible leg pains in my left leg i was diagnosed about a week ago and i cannot find anywhere how rare it is in percentages or anything in people the age of 15 and i do not really trust google to tell me what i am going to go through in the future.
6510,I swear I do not think I ever completely recuperated from having Shingles. My body has never felt the same. Get the vaccine people
6512,Shingles vaccine: Oh man this reminds me of a trip to my dermatologist recently. They always have me talk to the doctor's assistant first and then the doctor comes in and I repeat everything. I have no idea why. When I sat down with the assistant who was no older than 25 she said very politely but a little patronizingly Mr. Bradley when you were in last month we prescribed you some cream for your face you were supposed to use for two weeks. Do you remember using that cream? Do I remember? Of course I remember. It made my skin turn red and hurt. And it was only last month And then it hit me. From the perspective of a 25yearold a 55yearold man looks the same as an 80yearold man. She honestly thought I might be senile and that I forgot all about the treatment already
6514,Doctor accidentally double vaccinated our 2 month old at his 2 month appointment.: That Is not my point my baby got his rsv vaccine. Its the doctors office not checking his records correctly and when seeing my baby have to get jabbed extra and scream his head off pains me internally and then knowing he got an extra he did not need ??? That would upset me.
6517,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Watch my mom spend a year in agony. That was wake up call.
6521,Female 64 yr old stem cell transplant for leukemia treatment in May 2022 130 lbs e GFR 60 Creatinine 0 96 m gdL Mother was on oral a cy clo vi r prophylactic due to stem cell transplant and not being able to receive the shingles vaccine until this summer. Without me knowing she discontinued it in november Mid December developed a severe rash and finally went to the ER on January 1st. Diagnosed with shingles along 6 to 8 der mato mes and meningitis. Nucleic Acid Amplification Test Showed negative for herpes simplex virus 1 2 and positive for Varicella zoster virus. Admitted to the hospital an started on IV a cy clo vi r 10 mg kg every 12 hrs. Discharged after 3 days and prescribed Va lacy clo vi r 1 gram three times a day. 24 hours after discharge she is experiencing worsening severe pain in her head and behind her eye like she did right before going to the ER. Everything I am reading says that dosage for V Z V is 2 grams Va lacy clo vi r every SIX hours. Was she put on the incorrect dosage? I do not understand why the dosage seems to be for HSV 1 and her notes from the doctor mention HSV but her lab shows negative for HSV 12 but positive for V Z V. Very stressed out but she is refusing to go back to the ER yet
6523,Beyfortus?: All I can say is I highly recommend the beyfortus shot and any other vaccine your doctor recommends. Especially for a preemie. Beyfortus and the flu shot were crucial for our daughter last year.
6526,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: Coconut oil can help with the itch. That's what my friends and family who've already had shingles have told me."
6527,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: One of those crunchy moms ran a small inhome daycare and I had started using her. My son was 4yo. A few months go by everything's mostly fine. Then one day my son starts sprouting spots. He would never even slowed down or complained about feeling unwell. And he would had the chicken pox vaccine He had about 12 spots. Three days later me at age 40 gets chicken pox for the first time in my life. I gave birth without drugs and this pain was way worse. Turns out this idiot believes in pox parties and it is a spiritual transition point that every child should have. I am now 60 and have been fighting shingles on and off for the past 15 years.
6533,Fortunately my shingles vaccine was the live one dose type and I had no ill effects from that either. I Have just had the Respiratory one a few days ago and no ill effects from that either. I Have been very lucky that none of them have affected me.
6538,RSV vaccine: I got all the recommended vaccines. I got the flu and Tdap at I believe 28 weeks and then RSV and COVID at 34 weeks. Could have done the COVID one sooner but my OB office does not offer it and I was too lazy to go to the local pharmacy so I kept putting it off. Still came down with something though. I am 36 weeks now and have no idea what I just caught. No fever though so hopefully baby's fine.
6542,long post ahead I mean it. I have been living in hell. And I did it all alone. A little background because it is relevant. I am a medically retired combat vet. I am 100 PT from the VA due to severe CPTSD. Add to that I also have active pulmonary sarcoidosis and everything that entails. Most days it is a struggle just to handle daily tasks such as hygiene making food or feeding the cats. My wife often finds herself as my caregiver. So it all started in June of 22 when I noticed a rash pop near my waist on my right side. Two days later my fears were confirmed. Shingles had taken hold and was making my life difficult. At the same time the transmission in my car decided it had enough of things and stopped working. Now I love cars but I hate shopping for a car for myself. I have pretty severe executive dysfunction and despise making decisions on things especially when there are a lot of choices. Fortunately having shingles made me not have the energy to stress over a decision so a low mile Lincoln Town Car was found and acquired. Easily the most luxurious car I have ever owned. I was pleased with my decision. Put some nice wheels on it installed a nice CD player gave it a bit more power and made it sound better.....it was a decent damn car man. Mid October of 22. We had bought tickets to see Joe Satriani in Kalamazoo on a whim. We got the mobility limited tickets cuz of my crippled ass. Little did we know the handicap section was literally up against the stage right in front of Joe's pedal rack. It....was....AMAZING I got handed a drum stick at the end of the show. It was awesome...simply an amazing evening. The last one we would have for a while. My wife had been dealing with chronic bronchitis since late winter. She would been to the doctor. She would been on antibiotics. Nothing helped. However over the last couple of weeks we would noticed a lump forming on her neck. We had an appointment for the Monday morning following the Joe concert for a biopsy so we knew cancer was on the table but we were not thinking about it during the concert. We were lost in the music. Fast forward to Monday morning. I wake up to find my wife in our spare bathroom coughing continuously. She cannot catch her breath. Okay. Time to call 911. I am out of my depth. Time to call in the pros. Give the information to the dispatcher as I wander the house gathering together a go bag. Hang up with the dispatcher and call the doctor who was going to do the biopsy. He had given me his cell number for some reason I have since forgotten but I am glad I had it. As it turned out he was on the tail end of his shift as the oncall doc at the ER and was already there. Get her in here and we will take care of her he said. On it. First responders and medics arrive and I show them in give them the rundown and then get the fxck outta the way. I gather her stuff and follow the ambulance to the hospital. I stopped at the intake desk and gave them her information and then got escorted back. By the time I got back there they were already prepping to intubate. She spent a week intubated in the ICU while I fought with the insurance company over prior authorization bullshxt. Doctors wanted to ship her across the state to get treatment at University of Michigan. Somehow the prior authorization paperwork got lost between the hospital fax machine and the insurance company's. However nobody told me that until I spoke to somebody is manager's supervisor's boss. I was going to go up the chain until I was nose to nose with a shareholder if I had to. Finally got that flustercluck figured out and Thursday afternoon they shipped my wife 200 miles away from me. It bears mentioning we had four cats at the time. One was special needs and incredibly skittish so if anyone other than my wife or I tried to feed him he would not eat. So there was no way for me to stay on the other side of the state with her. UofM had her for 2 weeks. I did manage to visit once. Unfortunately thanks to arthritis and fibromyalgia long car rides can be literal torture. Lucky for me I had just bought the perfect car for long distance car rides. There literally is no more comfortable car on the highway than a Lincoln Town Car. Even on these pockmarked Michigan roads your drink will never spill. It almost made the 5 hour round trip bearable. But I had to see her. I NEEDED to see her. She finally got to come home the week before Thanksgiving. She was initially diagnosed with some kind of weird skin cancer that I guess can occasionally pop up in the throat. I do not know. Either way they operated on her and did some stuff and put a stent in and other things and she wound up on a feeding tube for Thanksgiving. yaaaaaay. Whatever. She was home. Her daughter came down from Lansing to spend the holiday with us. It was pleasant. Until she got sick. Back into the hospital that Friday. Oh shit now her daughter and I are sick.. hello COVID you snotty congested lump of ick. It does bear mentioning that I am on immunosuppressive drugs for a disease which has already destroyed 25 of my lungs. There is a 36 hour stretch that consisted of me taking a double dose of THC gummies and chasing them with NyQuil then getting into the tub for a few hours then getting into bed for a few more hours....and repeat. Pretty sure the Hat Man tucked me in and kissed me goodnight more than once that stretch. Spoiler alert I did live. My O2 levels only dropped to like 81. I told myself if I dipped into the 70s for any length of time I would go to the ER. It was close though....it was close. During this time one of our cats our 17 year old house panther Sophie was starting to decline in health. We would noticed her quality of life starting to drop before my wife got sick and unfortunately she had been kind of out on the backburner due to the circumstances. But during my NyQuil cleanse I noticed she was getting worse and made the decision that it was time for her to cross the Rainbow Bridge. I let the family know and set the appointment. She went peacefully. I held her the whole time. There were tears and snot. She is still missed. My wife came home around mid December. She was home for Christmas thankfully. Still had a feeding tube but whatever. I had still put up the tree and decorated some. We did our best to enjoy it. At about 730 Christmas night my brother texts me. Have you heard from Dad today he asked. It occured to me I had not which was a bit off. He missed birthdays and stuff but he always threw us a Merry Christmas text. He always remembered the big holidays. Something in my brain told me what I did not want to know. But somehow I knew. Rather than texting him I went to Google. Put his full name in the search bar and sent it. The first result was the obituary for an indignant decedant that shared his name and birthday from the county he lived in. That selfish motherfxcker had gone and kicked off without bothering to tell anyone. And I get to break the news to my family on fxcking Christmas. You all still with me? Take a breath. Blink. Look around maybe stretch. Pt. 2 to follow if there is interest. Yeah there is still more to cover.
6546,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Weird I did not have any reaction to covid shots. I wonder if that means I will not for shingles.
6547,Waiting for outbreak to clear then 1st dose Shingrix: I got my 2nd dose July 11 and so far my outbreak has not come back and I Have had it 5 times since May and I had it consistently from 2021 to 2022 but it was silent shingles in my mouth that they could not diagnose because they could not see it. My oral surgeon was pretty brilliant though in his belief of what it was. I got my shots both of them as soon as I finished a round of antivirals even with active shingles with the doctors blessing.
6550,Shingles week 29: Definitely keep an eye on it And I never had ocular shingles I had them on my side but I do randomly still feel little tingles and zaps years later so just fyi I had shingles at like 23 and it was BRUTAL those first few days but a great excuse to stay home and ignore everyone right now lol
6552,Had the second shingles shot: I was fine after both of my shots.
6558,Shingles vaccine: Can also confirm I had a mild case of it last year at 30. Every so often I would get shooting nerve pain up my back that would stop me in my tracks. And I am too young to get the vaccine so now I am scared I will get it again and it will be worse.
6559,Well crap. I had my covid booster 3 weeks ago but it was not vaccine Oh well. Yesterday I went in for my 2nd shingles vaccine and it is currently kicking my behind.
6562,Flu and shingles shots?: The shingles vaccine which is two shots is horrible. I got really sick both times even the pharmacist warned me it would be bad. However you do not have to get it again after that and its better than getting shingles Do it when you can have the day off and maybe the next day. Flu shots do not bother me.
6564,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Prob both. i am going to picker Edit and it itched SO bad
6569,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I never had the chickenpox but was given the vaccination for the last three years I Have been getting shingles outbreaks. I have now had the shingles about 30 times. They really do not recommend getting the shingles vaccine until the 50 year mark though. I Have talked to countless doctors and pharmacists now about it.
6572,Shingles vaccine: The first was fine other than sore arm. But just in case maybe to it after the holiday?
6574,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it at 19 and it fucking hurt. Cannot get the vaccine until you are at least 55 I believe. You can get shingles more than once.
6575,Shingles vaccine: Can confirm. I had shingles twice. First time was when I started Methotrexade. The second time was a few years later. By then antiviral meds were available so the second episode was much milder. But shingles is very painful. So now I Am vaccinated.
6578,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was the carrier for a poxparty. It feels gross.
6579,Anyone used antiviralsacyclovir while suffering with LC?: What convinced me to take it was reducing the chance of getting long term nerve pain after shingles. I already struggle with nerve pain and I did not want to encourage more of it Where is his shingles? Mine was on my leg in an area that has had chronic nerve pain since the vaccine. It was quite interesting it would appear there and now I wonder if my recurring nerve pain in that area was a form of internal shingles without a rash. I Am curious if his location is at all linked to any of his LC areas of issue.
6581,Could reactivation of herpes virus because neuropathy and brainfog? Shingles vaccine?: I got two shingle vaccines specifically to help against potentially reactivated varicella. But it did not have any benefit to my LC. I have also tried the Celebrex and Valtrex both together and separately for high EBV titers but no discernible benefit. Personally I have ruled out reactivation of herpesviruses. I blame my troubles squarely on the covid virus.
6583,"What's up with crazy conspiracy theories and why do they spread and grow so well in the community?: PizzaGate: Seriously? Oh, there is hanky with pizza on it and some emails so Podesta and Hillary kill and eat kids. Oh, and then some dude shot a hard drive and he was an actor trying to destroy evidence! Ok: Why would you need someone to come in and shoot your computer (not the HD) when you could just erase the drive and throw it away for a new one? Anyone? Nope. Didn't think so. Next on that topic: Does anyone, and this is for the people on the right (which most theories come from of this nature), really think Hillary cut the face off a kid and then wore it and ate them? Yes, yes conservatives believe that shit. Why? Because they want to. -------------------- Covid: Oh shit, here we go. First it was covid was being covered up and was killing people left and right in Wuhan. And our government wasn't addressing it. End times incoming! Then it morphed into covid doesn't exist, masks help and then don't (Fauci covered up masks helping, right? Oh wait, they don't help? Fauci was right then wrong? were conspiracy people right then wrong?) Covid won't hurt anyone, just a cold. No one died. And if they did die it was because they didn't eat horse paste from the Tractor Supply Store. Trump rushed through approval for a vaccine, he is a hero (and he claimed a lot of credit for something developed by two Turkish, iirc, people, etc). Oh wait! The FDA, which we said before held us back on getting drugs approved, a problem solved by Trump, has approved an emergency use of it. But, wait again! Why aren't they going through all the trials and years of worked we bitched about them doing before and slowing things down? I am dizzy now. Did you bitch about the FDA before having too much red tape and are now bitching that there isn't enough? What the hell do you want? ------------------- Ivermectin: Pills are approved for human use in certain cases. But now....just buy the horse paste and eat it! Screw Biden and the evil cabal and deep state. They don't want you to eat the paste! Suddenly, the scientists and doctors are out to stop you from eating paste and want you to get that vaccine you were talking about above"
6584,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Depending where you live spring allergy season may have started that just make you blah feeling anyway.
6587,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My twin sister caught it as a teen and she still has scars on her face neck and torso. She was hospitalized and had the sores in her mouth and esophagus. I got a mild case years earlier and was perfectly fine. Definitely made sense at the time.
6588,41 and got Shingles: Had at 37ish horrible sorry pal I think stress got to me to get them
6591,Decreased Fetal Movement After Vaccines: I got all 3 flu Tdap and RSV and noticed no change related to the vaccines themselves. What I do notice is that if I have a change in routine then there is usually a change in movement. It does not matter what caused the change a work trip having to take my older child to the doctor etc there is change. So if I overexert myself like when I did for the last vaccine my baby moves less. I guess he gets tired as well? D
6593,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: I got the vaccine while pregnant. I had a preemie and he got the vaccine like a week after birth. Hes now 10 weeks and completely fine. He was not even that fussy and did not have a fever or anything after the vaccine.
6595,"Ever notice on Drug Commercials on TV that they are required to list out all of the possible side effects and to consult your doctor? All of the Get Vaccinated Commercials don't list out any side effects and they don't ask you to consult your doctor.: Not one MSM Source I have read has listed any side effects of the MRNA vaccine. Other than the basic chills, and muscle aches. None of the ""serious"" side effects. Everything I have read from MSM is saying don't worry ""it's not from the vaccine."" This is just a anomaly. And if you really pay attention to these drug commercials some of the side effects are shit that I don't want to fuck with either. Like I would rather stick with the original affliction. Because the original affliction is better then the side effects from this shit. Everything from Suicidal thoughts to wanting to kill your neighbors to depression, to sleepiness, etc., Then they list out o and by the way THIS ISNT ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS EITHER. PLEASE CONSULT A EXPERT BEFORE TAKING THIS DRUG. Why arent the Get Vaccinated commercials not listing out any side effects? This is still a drug and should be required to list the potential harm to your health. And yet they aren't. Does Emergency Approval mean they don't got to follow any guidelines? Because that's what it seems like to me."
6600,Anyone gets these regularly who did not get gardasil younger?: I got the vaccine and have high risk hpv so just be cautious and do not get too comfortable got gardasil 4 in middle school 2 dose series garadsil 9 one dose in high school first positive results this year in Jan
6602,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I had shingles on my back hip stomach bikini line and pubic area. I know just how painful it gets I am 24 and my doctor was BAFFFLLLLEEEED I got it so young had chicken pox twice
6606,My LO is 12 weeks and I really have not let many people around him nor have I brought him out to a store yet. I have 4 nieces who attend daycare and preschool but they have not been around my baby yet because they do get sick often and I Am so worried about him catching something. He received his two month vaccines plus the RSV antibody shot. Am I being paranoid? When did you all feel comfortable bringing your baby out to storesaround more people and kids?
6607,I never had reactions to any shingles shot or booster. No issues with 4 previous Covid shots until a few months back. I got newest Moderna and flu shot same time same arm stupid move on my part.
6609,I am in the age bracket where shingles is a thing and a painful thing. In 1997 had GB S and was in the ICU paralyzed for a week 4 treatments of Gamma Globulin had me walking again and mostly recovered after three months. Since then I have only had covid vaccines pfizer baked beans spam and pfizer Spoke with a neurologist not a very satisfying consult but there ya go and took the plunge see what I did there? Why? Because I am told Shingles is very painful. The neurologist knew of no connections and I think at least I have her number now and my file is on record in case something happens in the next few weeks though to be honest if I did get a recurrence I do not think I would trust her to be a GB S specialist. FWIW the shot seems more painful than the covid shots I have had but not close to intolerable like the cyst os copy I had a few months ago. Heh you future cyto s cops you have some great experiences to look forward too. My arm is supposed to be painful for the next couple of days. the title of this post had an A I assist because A I is all I have now
6612,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: I had shingles inside my ear. I have a little ear cleanercamera gadget and I could see the rash with it. I also had it inside my nose on one side. The first doctor I saw said I was overreacting and he did not see any rash. I went to my local walk in clinic and showed them the pics. By that point I had the rash behind my ear as well. They said it was shingles and prescribed antivirals. This was in November and I am still dealing with pain and light sensitivity. I am taking gabapentin and it helps the pain.
6614,Got my Shingles vaccine: I have broken out with shingles now like 4 times in about 40 years. Only this most recent time did it actually bother me. I have some pictures. But right behind the armpits is a fun place..
6618,RSV vaccine Abryso because: I got it in the fall I did not need a prescription and was able to go as a walkin at Shoppers. I had it partially covered so paid about 120 of the 300 total plus an injection fee. I had no soreness or side effects from it.
6622,Shingles vaccine: It is a 2 part vaccine Yes it stung but nowhere near to pain of shingles.
6625,Tell me about your vaccine flares: That Is interesting that you did not get a flare for two months. I Have noticed that if I use capsaicin arthritis cream on places where poison ivy has touched me that are feels like I Am on fire for 1530 minutes then I stop itching for 68 hours. I Have always told my husband that it feels like it has burnt out my nervous system for a while. Its how I sleep if I get into poison ivy.
6629,Video on Dystonia: I am 54 and took the Shingles shot . I take the following Famvir aka Famciclovir antiviral  500 mg daily . It gets bumped to 1000 for 57 days during break out . Which I have f had another since the initial . Thank god . Lysine  1500 Lemon balm  2400 Andrographis  8000 Monolaurin  1500 I take psyche meds one being Lithium its low dose . 300 mg I go for blood panel every 4 months . What do I need to do ? I see the neurologist again in March . It will be my 3rd Botox treatment. Hes conservative . I had 40 CC then 100 beginning of December I already broached the subject of herpes . I told him exactly what I told you. Is there a way to reverse this ? I Am going to the Cleveland Clinic which is known . Many people from all over the world come here. I Am lucky to live close. He is a sought after doctor with long waiting lists . I was lucky to get in quickly . I worked there before I had to resign due to this .
6634,That is unusual then. The pharmacist counseled is on a very long list of very common side effects and immune reaction to the vaccine all of which were less serious than shingles. Everyone I know has commented on lingering soreness and temporary illness.
6635,I Have had both the old Zostrix the Shingrix series. That Is likely what is preventing this from extensive spread. I have autoimmune diseases I Am very immunosuppressed so I Am always high risk. I just thank god I had the vaccines This is my 3rd episode
6637,Shingles: Yeah it is shingles for sure. Its not painful just itchytingly. That Is the only thing about the outbreaks for which I am greatful. Hindsight being 2020 I was exhausted a few days prior to vesicles popping up and my tailbone hurt so bad like I was kicked in the bum different from normal arthritis pain. The outbreak is on my hip and lower abdomen and both times I Have had it on one side of body.
6638,Had shingles before I got the vaccine. Ill take the side effects of the vaccine than the experience of pulsating stabbing nerve pain 247 for a month.
6639,Preventing shingles recurrance: Thanks that is helpful yes think that is what the GP said as well. Glad to hear that the cornea is ok. It's my worst fear it coming back in the eyes.
6646,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My mother just had shingles and now she is off work on longterm disability. Aside from the extreme pain it left her completely sapped of energy to the point where she has difficulty performing basic daytoday activities let alone going to work.
6650,"Has anyone seen a doctor that recommended additional vaccines?: I've heard things about Long COVID/ME being immunosuppressive and I'm wondering if there are any additional vaccines I should get, including a second shot of the COVID booster? (I got one in September.) I don't usually get the regular flu vaccine and haven't had one for pneumonia or anything but I've been concerned these are things I should consider. I'm concerned because last year I got sick with probably the flu (not COVID) around the holidays and got worse."
6651,Shingles vaccine: Did you develop flu like symptoms after the shot? I was told by my doctor to expect to be sick for a few days after the shot
6652,My sister got the Shingrix shot. And she got GuionBarre as a result. Thank goodness we figured out what the problem was and sought proper treatment in time steroids to reduce inflammation and she is mostly 'clear' at this point. Turns out that if you have a stenosis at an
6654,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 88 contracted chicken pox at school? and was old enough to remember taking an oatmeal bath. I developed shingles in college which left me with scarring and numbness on my back.
6655,Thought you all could appreciate thjs meme lol: Call me Shingles and prepare for PAIN bitch I Have never seen someone in more pain than my dad when he had shingles
6656,So I am dx ' ed and treated by my doc for high blood pressure. However I have huge health anxiety and white coat syndrome and I always see it rise when at docs ' offices. I want to get the Shingles vaccine but I am scared to go to a Walgreens or similar type of place and they take my BP for a vaccine appointment it is high and then they will not give me the shot. I got the covid vaccines as part of being a teacher en masse at a hospital so it was a different set up. Does anyone know? Can you walk me through a shingle vaccine appointment? Oh also my regular doc does not do vaccines or flu shot shots. Thank you
6660,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine and still got chicken pox at 18. That was after being sent to what must have been over a dozen chicken pox parties when I was much younger just i am case the vaccine does not work. I am glad that I got it later in life purely just because I as able to resist scratching myself.
6661,I have had mine after a very mild dose of shingles I do not want it again. Good idea if you have ever had Chickenpox.
6663,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You were lucky they did that. I got chicken pox at 13 and it was AWFUL. I was out of school for two weeks. My eyes would be glued shut every morning from the pox goo. My sister was 11 and had the same experience. Really bad scars. It was horrible. If we had avoided it until adulthood it could have been deadly. Our 6 year old sister who got it from school and then passed it to us was totally fine and it was nbd. There was no way to know there would be a chicken pox vaccine coming.
6667,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: I was in my 30s when I got shingles. Fortunately it was not too bad just a really bad itching.
6670,Shingles again?: Exactly the same for me. 3 times before and 3 times after. Mine was always super mild but I caught the first sore within 12 hours. It was so weird I got into my Dr and on antiviral quickly. I thought I had a Mersa sore or spider bite or something weird. All 6 are in the same spot. I now just keep the meds at home.
6672,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: I got the Shingrix and it really kicked my butt. Agree it was much worse than the COVID vaccine But over time I Have forgotten exactly how bad wait protect against dementia? Joking def get the shot. One of my only slightly older friends got shingles and definitely would not recommend.
6676,New Chime in Similar Diagnoses 35yo 2.9cm nuclear grade 2 low mitotic lymph imaging normal: Sounds a bit like me...I was diagnosed at 38 I am 39 now grade 2. Docs originally thought some lymph nodes looked suspicious then decided the nodes were fine and that the swollen look was due to a recent Covid shot. Then unfortunately they found 4 positive nodes after all during my SMX and sentinel node surgery. That led to ACT chemo 28 doses of rads and now AIZoladex. I am supposed to start Verzenio soon. I did switch from a Nexplanon hormonal birth control implant to a Paraguard IUD once I was diagnosed and have not had any issues with that so far no periods anyway with the ovarian suppression. I finished chemo in late December and have some hair now something in between a buzz cut and a pixie. No lymphedema so far despite 11 nodes being removed. I do short hikes and am getting back into light jogging now that I have stopped peeling from rads. If you are thinking about getting vaccinations just be aware that they can because temporarily swollen lymph nodes and potentially confuse things on the ultrasound as happened in my case. Maybe ask your medical team about the best timing for those.
6678,Sick: We have an 8 week old and a 4 year old. I combat it as much as possible by making sure everyone was up to date on their vaccines flu for the older kid and dad flucovidtdap and rsv vaccines for myself while pregnant. I take a high dose of vitamin d for myself which baby may get some through breastmilk but I also try and remember to give him his vit d daily. I also take a lot of other supplements to address for my autoimmune disorder including zinc and omega 3 and I focus a lot on my diet to stay as healthy as possible. We wash our hands a lot and I make our older kid wash theirs every time they want to touch the baby. While it sucks not having family nearby to help we also do not have a lot of other people coming around to hold him. I get the health anxiety for sure I have OCD and it hits hard postpartum. My mom flew up to watch our oldest while I was in labor and she contracted covid before she came here. She tested positive the day we went to the hospital. She did start Paxlovid and masked when she was with our older kid and she flew home the day after we came home. Thankfully none of us got it. I had a gnarly sore throat and cold about 23 weeks postpartum which baby got a little congested from but nothing major. Unfortunately there is only so much we can do to protect our babies. Breastmilk can help but its a fairly short window that antibodies that help fight against respiratory viruses are transferred this is a helpful link that explains it . If you are seeing a lot of newbornsinfants in the hospital right now its likely due to RSV. If you did not get the RSV vaccine while pregnant or for baby yet there is still time It should be available through January. For anyone concerned its literally just RSV antibodies that hang in babys system until they encounter the virus.
6680,"Shingles related to Covid? Pain months ahead outbreak: I would never want to risk getting this activated in me again after I'm still having issues and life is not back to normal just yet for me.... thinking I am happy I can't get the vaccine now because I was wanting it thinking it would lower my chances of getting it again, not risk it happening again. There has to be something I'm not understanding or educated enough on about it so looks like I'm headed to do some more research on it. Thank you for letting me know."
6682,More evidence of a failing immune system: Fun anecdotei got blood drawn years ago to volunteer in a medical clinic. I had no antibodies to CP so they gave me the vaccine. Came back six months later and they tested me again weird no antibodies They wanted to give it to me again and I declined. Why would I do that again? Within six months I came down with an autoimmune illness that took me years to connect to the vaccine I had received. And last year I got shingles womanshrugging
6683,Shingles vaccine: I did not have bad reaction
6684,Sore arm 1 week after Gardasil?: I Am not really sure. I was due for screening this year and here in Canada we have switched from paps to HPV selfscreening so I did that for the first time. Came back as positive for HPV 16. Referred for colposcopybiopsy which showed a small spot of CIN3. Then referred for LEEP. I had normal paps before this last pap was 3 years prior.
6685,My doctor had no idea why I had sudden jointnerve pain. She suggested I take 2 Advil twice a day for 2 weeks. no effect Eventually I made the link to the Shingles vaccine. That is when she thought to look at the package insert. She had no solution except to ride it out.
6692,Experts urge vaccination as RSV and 'whole bunch of viruses' circulate across the country: Not nessecarily as there are different variants I Have caught covid twice in two months fully vaccine
6693,My aunt received this vaccine at the recommendation of her doctor 2 weeks later she got shingles for the first time
6695,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It was not the worst pain I ever felt by a long mile. But until my back injury it was. I thought I had a ruptured spleen or something because of the intense internal pain from it. I went to the ER in fact because I thought I was having an emergency. And then I got the rash badly solid all over my torso and I had the internal nerve pain from it too. It lasted a month.
6699,Had shingles on my forehead and scalp: Oh my Goodness This sounds exactly like I wrote this Except mine was on the left side of face. Started with a migraine for 3 daysthen throwing my guts up. St that point hubs takes me to ER. They diagnosed me almost immediately. They put me on same drug with some eye drops as well. I had very little breakout as well. Just a 4 or 5 spots along my nose. But I had some intense pain that followed that nerve to my teeth cheek and ear It finally let up on Day 9. My head is also very tender like I have a sunburn on my scalp Be thankful that you started the viral drugs that basically help tremendously in stopping the spread. No its not coming back because you had a light break out. It may come back in 5 or 10 years as another breakout or never. My son is an ER dr so I have a support system. He did not treat me initially fyi. My awesome ER dr suggested I wait about a year and get the vaccine. Considering what I just went through I am going to follow his recommendation I never want to go through this again. It was truly an awful illness. I hope you are healing well and feeling well
6703,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got my RSV shot when I was pregnant now me and baby are home safe while there is an RSV outbreak at my toddlers daycare. I Am so thankful that I can give my baby the protection.
6717,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: No reaction to the first. The reaction to the second one was awful like the worst flu I have ever had multiplied by 2 for around 2436 hours. I have known people who have had shingles though and that misery was worth enduring in comparison.
6719,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Get it. Our 6mo old required Bipap oxygen in the PICU for 4 days then 3 days of regular high flow. Scariest time of our lives wish he was eligible at his 4 month but because of supply it was only for preemies and high risk babies.
6720,Female 30 weight 147 height 5foot 31 weeks pregnant I have been diagnosed with shingles. Ophthalmic shingles. I know it will get worse before it gets better. I am on an antiviral and erythromycin. What are some things I can do to help reduce the swelling and pain? My right side of my face is starting to bruise the nerve pain is radiating down my nose check and lower jaw and even causing dental pain. I do not even want to eat it hurts like heck. I was not prescribed anything for pain as when I was seen I was not experiencing pain. And I do not want to take or do anything that will harm the baby. I have been doing cold packs and that does not seem to be helping much. Any helpful information would be awesome.
6721, 3 Months Hey everyone if you have been following me 33 Y.O. you know that I tested positive for HPV a while ago. I was diagnosed with HighGrade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion HSIL in my cervix which was a tough diagnosis to face but I Am happy to share some good news with all of you I recently received my endocervical curettage results after having a colposcopy and the results are looking great No lesions were found on my cervix and here is a breakdown of the pathology report  Benign  Appearing Endocervical Mucosa  Glandular Epithelium The tissue sample contains fragments of normal benign endocervical mucosa which is the lining of the cervix.  NEGATIVE FOR HPV CYTOPATHIC EFFECT  NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA  NonKeratinizing Squamous Epithelium with Mild Atypia A section of the tissue contains a strip of squamous epithelium that is not keratinized. The cells in this strip show mild atypia slightly abnormal appearance but there are no signs of severe abnormalities like prominent mitotic figures a sign of active cell division or HPVrelated changes which might indicate infection by the human papillomavirus.  Squamous Metaplasia Over Dysplasia The mild atypia could suggest that this strip of tissue is undergoing squamous metaplasia a process where one type of cell changes into another possibly over an area that might have had early signs of dysplasia abnormal cells. To be honest I feel so relieved after fighting for 3 months. I Have been focusing on natural ways to boost my immune system supporting my body with proper nutrition reducing stress and overall focusing on my health. I believe this approach helped me clear the infection and prevent any progression to cancer. I know many of us can feel scared when dealing with HPV and cervical abnormalities but I want to share that its possible to heal naturally and to overcome this. Update My KUB Xray shows everything is functioning correctly. The ENT doctor found no HPV lesions and no signs of oropharyngeal cancer after using a camera to examine my throatthough I did cry during the procedure. I later learned you are supposed to get numbed for it. My dentist also checked for oral cancer and HPV and everything was normal no signs of HPV or Oral cancer. My upcoming appointments  February 7 2025 2nd HPV dose  1st dose had my arm numb for almost a week  September 17 2025 Followup for Pap smear and HPV testing and my Dr will check to see if mild atypia went away. She think it will after i receive my 3rd HPV dose and want me to use condoms until final dose. Stay strong take care of yourselves and do not give up hope
6724,I am 32 and going through shingles a second time is this abnormal?: Mine seems to be fairly mild this time but I think I luckily caught it early and I am already on gabapentin for anxiety so I think that helped with the pain I remember from the first time I had it.
6726,Santa bright me shingles 46M 175lbs: It was more of a burning feeling but more recently has evolved to more of an itching and aching. Good times Thanks for the response.
6728,Exposing Covid Vaccine Trials  Shane Smith Has Questions w Brianne Dressen: Last fall I received the Pneumonia RSV Flu and COVID vaccines the same day. I felt fine neither arm was sore for more than a few hours.
6729,"45 yr old male diagnosed last week: Hey everyone, I'm a 45 year old man who was diagnosed with shingles last week. It all started with a persistent headache and pain in my lower back. I had received the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain intensified, and I noticed a rash developing on my chest. I went to the doctor and was prescribed medication to help with the symptoms. I've been feeling exhausted and have had trouble sleeping due to the discomfort. The doctor mentioned that the vaccine might have played a role in triggering the shingles. Has anyone else experienced something similar after getting vaccinated?"
6732,Put me out of my misery.: Same experience. It is normal. I had to sleep the whole day. But shingles is terrible. I have seen it. I do not want to have that ever.
6735,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles just like this in my thirties and it sucked badly. Definitely get vaccinated if you can afford it.
6736,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: This is not correct. You can get shingles even if you have had the vaccine. I had the vaccine never had chicken pox but got shingles.
6738,Shingles Is NO Joke: I have severe RA that is uncontrolled. Went off of Rinvoq10 or so weeks ago. Since first week of OctoberTooth infection so bad they had to put me out to pull it. 3 days later UTI. 1week later flu like virus that lasted 2 weeks. Then foot infection as in literally hole in bottom of my foot almost going to my bone needing hospitalization infection. Atvleastv3 weeks. And 2 days before Christmas Eve I started having symptoms of this. It all has to be uphill from here right? I miss feeling better when I was in the Rinvoq but I do not want to go through series of illnesses like this ever again My Immune System Hates Me
6739,Anyone had shingles vaccine as trigger?: Get the Shingles shot Afib is a walk in the park compared to Shingles. Yes have had both.
6740,Do I have scabies?: I had shingles when I was 25 and it looked just like this but it was also super painful
6741,Thank you. I Have had both the vaccine Shingrix series. My last 2 shingles episodes were easily managed. This time I Am severely immunosuppressed so all bets were off. I Have been thru all the OTC stuff it seems a combo works best at this point.
6743,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: If you do have a reaction it will likely be after the second shot anyway. I had almost no reaction at all but I pretended to do I could have a day off
6746,"Just got my HPV vaccine and man, that needle was no joke! But the peace of mind knowing I'm protected against certain cancers is worth it. #vaccinessavelives"
6747,41 and got Shingles: I had a coworker get it at 38 on her face and that was her complaint too That her hair was too heavy She also had to spend lots of time with the eye doctor and use special drops etc. Coincidentally at the same time I had Bell's Palsy and half my face was paralyzed. We joked that between the two of us we had one fullyfunctioning face.
6750,I really had no effects from the Shingrix vaccine but maybe because I had shingles 2x previously. Rest. Hopefully the 2nd one will not be quite as bad.
6752,"Strange Rash/ Hives.: 23F | Caucasian | 5'6 Inches | 150pd's | No existing medical issues besides mental health. I did have eczema when I was super young (around, 2-4) & it runs in the family. Not on any prescription medication for my mental health. Supposed to be taking Zoloft but not. I did go to my family doctor about this situation last week and was told it was not Chicken pocks or shingles ( I did NOT get them as an adolescent ) he told me it was an allergic reaction of some kind and he prescribed me; Blexten bilastine tablets / 8 pills(4packs), 20mg. The medication has NOT done anything and it's been progressing. This is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this. The start of the hives began about 2 weeks ago but got worse very quickly. It started on my stomach & head then it spread to my arms/armpits, my hands, my legs, and my feet. There was nothing on my back or neck/face until a couple of days ago. The itching was minimal the first week but then it started to get pretty bad but only whenever I was stressed out or they were rubbing against something. Should I go to an emergency room?"

6756,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I Am nearly there and had Shingles at age 35 on my forehead which traveled to my right eye. Luckily it did not fuck my eyesight that badly. Everyone should get this vaccine Shingles fucking hurts.
6758,Got my Shingles vaccine: Everyone complains about it and many say it took them down but my only reaction was a sore arm.
6761,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: Ack its so stressful have little ones in daycare during peak illness season Fwiw I have an infant in daycare as well as her older sister in daycare and we have had some minor bugs but nothing major. We do emphasize lots of handwashing and good general hygiene for the whole fam. My infant got the RSV vaccine in October and last month two infants in her class got RSV. I was bracing for the worst but my daughter did not even get a sniffle. No way to know for sure of course but it seems probable that the vaccine was at least partially a factor in keeping her healthy.
6765,I Am just now getting over a case of Guillan Barre. Standing and walking now after a month of not being able to. Shingles vaccine says May because Guillan Barre.
6768,Shingles vac: I am on x el jan z which is high risk for shingles but at the time I started on it the inactive vaccine was not available where I live. I got shingles about 18 months later and it fuck en sucked. So miserably painful like my skin was on fire in a band across one side of my body that was aligned exactly with where my bra band sits. A friend with Crohn's got shingles in her eye and it was incredibly bad. She was in agony and it took weeks to start improving. You just cannot imagine how painful it can be. do not forget too that it can be the gift that gives on giving if you end up with n europa thy. The moment that the inactive vaccine is available to me I am getting it.
6769,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I personally was lucky. Only symptoms I had for both shots was a bit of soreness in the arm where I got the needle.
6775,1st pic left thigh 2nd pic up close 3rd pic right thigh Just started this am . I Have had my shingles shots. I Am 54. Nonstop itching all day. Of course trying not too. Any ideas appreciated thanks.
6777,I Am ok now. The shingles pain was way bad so I got double vaccinated Shingrix suggest the same for others. Vaccine is no picnic but alternative can be horrible.
6778,First shingles vaccine side effects: Nope I was lucky. No side effects for either shot.
6784,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: The Shingles vaccine will kick your ass but its miles better than actual Shingles.
6785,Undiagnosed Shingles: Since you were diagnosed late and late into antivirals it is possible you have nerve damage from your initial outbreak. It is also possible that what you are feeling now is postherpetic neuralgia a chronic condition from shingles nerve damage although you could be having a milder shingles attack. If it is shingles again the antivirals you are on could be suppressing other symptoms. I know that paragraph is full of possibly and could be but I am not a doctor just someone who has had shingles a lot. I got facial nerve damage my first time around and it took two and a half years for the pain to go away completely. After that I got the Shingrix vaccine and had milder outbreaks thereafter but as I now know the damage had been done. Fortunately after the first time I knew what to look for when outbreaks started so I got valacyclovir as quickly as I could. You have noted the exhaustion which is so frustrating with shingles. It is an aftereffect from both shingles and the antivirals but eventually it will fade. Get lots of rest and drink lots of water. When nausea hits me from the antivirals I rely on tea and crackers. Telling you to wait out the pain sounds like I am minimizing what you are going through but truly the nerve pain is in a class of its own. When I am in an outbreak I feel like I am being told to walk it off with two broken legs. But neither OTC nor prescription painkillers do much good for me. Some people have posted that Botox injections helped but I have no experience with that and was recommended against it due to other complications. Since Botox paralyzes the nerve it makes sense it could help in some cases. As far as a third dose of the antivirals I do not know how effective that would be for you if this is all part of your May outbreak. I do know that my former primary care told me not to worry about taking valacyclovir too often that it does not lose its effectiveness through continued use. However I recently read something online that somewhat contradicted that suggesting that you could build up an immunity to it. So ask your doctor about that if you think you need more antivirals like everything else out there for shingles it is maybe and possibly. So I have no absolute answers for you but a ton of sympathy particularly on the late diagnosis. My own experience has left me with the old What if I had been diagnosed sooner? questions in the middle of the night. I can tell you that dwelling on that has solved nothing and I have to deal with the here and now. So concentrate on your symptoms and reactions. Nobody knows how you feel better than you and if you get too muddled to keep your progress fresh in your mind write it down for your next doctor's appointment. I have had good doctors andwell let us just say not so good. At least they all meant well. But your knowledge of your own body is every bit as important as their training. Keep looking for answers every time you have a question. We may be a bunch of internet lurkers but we have gone through some of what you are going through now. Take care of yourself and like Hallmark says get well soon.
6788,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Fully vaccinated when a kid just had it in 2022... At 31...fucking sucked
6791,Tysabri Infusion Shingles: I was on Vumerity at the time. I had gone to a concert in Chicago and I typically get sick after a concert. I had a chest cold and ended up getting shingles on top of it. That was December of 2019. I had the same symptoms as Covid. I had the vaccine as soon as I could get it.
6795,Shingles vaccine: No ill effect on me. Sister head shinglesterribly painful
6801,Shingles vaccine experience: My wife has had shingles 3 times. Once prevaccine and twice post vaccine. Crazy. I felt terrible for her. To be fair the latter cases were very mild. She Is the type who always finds the flaws. Poor girl.
6804,My in laws are throwing a party for my baby who will be 1 month 10d old by that time. Guest list is pretty huge and most of it is outdoors. She has her RSV vaccine and all the others but I am still nervous. Any advice on how to keep her safe and comfy for the few hours were there?
6805,Shingles vaccine experience: First shingles shot hurt and the second hurt even more but was not nearly as bad as the pneumonia vaccine. Still knowing the vaccine would likely let me avoid the pain my father and mother did when they had shingles I would do it again in a hearbeat
6807,Me too just had the second dose horrible But my great uncle had shingles that affected his eyes long ago before antivirals and I remember him sitting in the corner basically crying in pain. Vaccinations are well worth a few days of feeling miserable.
6811,Everybody told me the second shingles shot would be worse than the first. The first night I almost believe them. But the first night is the only problem I have had. I seem to be okay and clear. Well alrighty then Now for the covid and flu shots
6812,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I know someone who got it as an adult. She was healthy and in her mid30s at the time and was out of work for one day short of 6 weeks. It was bad.
6820,Shingles vaccine shot feels like I got hit with a MAC truck.
6821,Shingles vaccine: I had the series of two Shingrix vaccinations with no side effects at all except a slightly sore arm no worse than with any other vaccine. I was prepared for a lot worse but everyone I know who has had shingles says Get the shot.
6822,Second Shingles Shot: I got mine but it was not pleasant. I definitely am not suggesting people should not get their shot but the reaction does vary. I would recommend doing it when you do not have to work for the next couple of days and do not have big plans. That way you get your shot and if you are good you can do something relaxing in your free time. I thought about not getting the second shot but prepared for it instead.
6824,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Ahh this especially the last part of what you said My boyfriend got shingles at 25 and never had chickenpox. He thought he had spider bites or got something from the gym. I know gross but he is a personal trainer and had a bout of weird things like ring worm So he thought it was then suddenly it multiplied. When we went to the doctor the doctor said it could have been triggered by stress. We just moved together and were under a lot of stress adjusting to the new place. It took him 34weeks to recover. He had to use steroid creams AND calamine lotion and could barely wear clothed because it felt like his skin was on fire. But he is better now lol
6830,Shingles Vaccine: Yes I had shingles in 2018 and got my vaccine last year before starting Ocrevus.
6834,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: I thought I had severe muscle pain then later thought I had a kidney stone or something it was on my right side. Docs did not find anything and it was not until later a rash broke out and I ended up with pain in several surrounding areas inside my body. I did not know until then that shingles could be internal as well as external.
6837,Sorry to challenge your N1 theory but I got shingles prior to the COVID vaccine Millions of other people around the world got shingles before COVID or its vaccines existed. I was a nurse in 1980s treated many older people with shingles. Its age immune system related.
6839,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I got it when I was 8 years old lol. That to this day is the most pain I have ever experienced.
6840,I have had both doses of the shingles vaccine and had no reaction. You are the only person that I have heard of having a reaction. Feel better
6845,First time with shingles is this normal?: Yeah I had it under my arm my stomach my legs my arms and my chest. I Have been on the anti viral for two weeks and my skin still feels like its on fire. Its terrible I just want to feel better. Nothing seems to help the burning either. I hope you start to feel better soon.
6846,Hearing about the possible side effects kept me from getting the Shingrix vaccine for a while. But I barely had any side effects for either dose. So to anyone putting it off you might be as lucky as I was. Get it done.
6851,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: If you have questions about the vaccine you need to talk to your doctor about your concerns. Not your friends not the internet not me talk to a real MD. The way I see it the vaccine is making up for the fact the US has nearly eradicated childhood chickenpox and our immune systems simple cannot get immunized the natural way which is when your kid or grandkid gets sick and reintroduces it to your immune system every generation. Pros Your chance of severedangerouspainful side effects goes way down and you might even avoid shingles altogether. Cons If your regular reaction to vaccines is standardgood the site may be sore for a few days. To me its a no brainer. The risk of getting severe shingles or flu or Covid or tetanus or whatever is way more frightening to me than having a sore arm.
6853,Sick after first dose. Please help: Respectfully Id disagree. This was worse than any experience drinking I ever had x100. Its now 1am and I think I Am through the worst of it but I still feel like I got hit by a truck. Shakes fever nausea restlessness diarrhea. Its like last night I had the worst case of the flu I Have ever had and now I just have normal flu symptoms. This stuff is horrible.
6863,GenX Shingrix: I did a Rona booster and Flu shot on the same day. While my immune system response was robust I do not recommend getting 2 vaccine shots on the same day I felt like I got run over by a truck. I did Shingrix and it was not bad. Certainly better than getting Shingles. My exin laws both had it and are apparently dealing with severe nerve pain years after. edit for spelling
6864,Is the antiviral a MUST?: The first time I had shingles when I was young it lasted weeks. There were 23 weeks of the random shooting pain. It was like being tasered. It brought me to my knees in writhing pain. This past month I started the antiviral as my blisters were erupting on my face and it stopped the progression in its tracks. The rash started to fade within 710 days and paindiscomfort was minimal. Id recommend the antiviral because I know how terrible it is without it. The antiviral will also stop the spread and any potential long term nerve damage. I had a numb spot on my back for YEARS after my first time. You Are right though the pills are HUGE why?. I also took 3000mg of Lysine a day and those were bigger and bitter Yuck
6866,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: I had shingles on my face in 2022 and again in 2023. I got both doses of shingrix earlier this year. Today I was sitting with my husband at his doctor appointment and I felt the spots pop up along my hairline by my eye. My face had been feeling weird and tingly for the last three days and I had a headache but I had not considered shingles because I was vaccinated. But it is happened enough that I know that feeling when the spots suddenly show up. After my husband's appt was done I went to my favorite walk in clinic. The provider looked at the bumps for a few seconds and confirmed it was shingles. She prescribed valtrex and prednisone and said to increase my gabapentin. Oh and apparently getting shingles when you are younger than usual is linked to an increased risk of stroke or TIA. I had a TIA last month right after my surgery and another one several days ago.
6867,Hi I was one of the last patients added to Pfizer s trial. Sharing my experience of being on Cibin qo for 2 5 years as it has been life changing for me. I m 100 clear and my skin barrier is healthy now and does not require moisturizer. I ve included my history experience tips on dosage and managing the side effects acne shingles. On the whole I m doing much better on Cibin qo vs Du pix ent Du pix ent gave me facial flares and hair loss. Jan 2021 Placed on Pfizer trial for Cibin qo 200 mg a day. Trial was meant to be blind but I guessed pretty soon from my results that I was getting the full dose. Itch dramatically stopped within a week. Within a month skin was healing and normal ising. In three months I was fully clear and able to go for a wedding in short sleeves. At my most recent appointment the trial clinicians note that I m fully clear and stable on the drug. Tips and what I ve learnt after 2 5 years on it Dosing Doctors initially asked me to take 200 mg every 24 hours. The pill wore off within 12 hours and I would feel the itch come back. We decided to switch it to 100 mg every 12 hours. Effectiveness Two years later I have skipped a dose sometimes or forgotten to take it before leaving the house and the itch remained manageable. Allergies Still remain highly allergic to pollen dust and cats. But I get a few hives and my eyes start getting sticky rather than an extreme full body itch. Taking an antihistamine helps. Side effects I had my blood and vitals taken every three months since starting the drug and have had no major health issues. The side effects I have experienced aren t ideal but on balance have been worth it to me. Acne Around eight months in I started getting pretty bad hormonal cystic acne. Spiro no lac tone at 100 mg for eight months reduced the acne significantly. However it had side effects that I did not like dizziness hard to wake up in the mornings. I switched from Spiro to drinking two to three cups of spearmint tea a day. My face is now relatively clear. Shingles. I have had mild shingles recur four times since starting Cibin qo in the same place usually during periods of high stress at work. JAK inhibitors do lower your immune response along the same viral infection pathways so I would recommend getting the shingles vaccine if you ve gotten chickenpox. Weight gain JAK inhibitors disrupt the signalling for the hormone leptin which helps to regulate hunger. Gained about 15 lb in the first six months but my weight has been stable since then. I had always told myself I d be willing to gain weight to not suffer from itch so I m fine with this. Hope this is helpful happy to answer any questions. If anyone has tips on how they have managed their acne too would appreciate it
6873,20 F with shingles even though I was vaccinated and have never had chickenpox: When I was 16 I got shingles. I was working and studying a lot did not take good care of myself and did not get much rest at the time. I went to the doctor for something else unrelated and mentioned that a had a rash on my back I thought it was an allergic reaction to my bra clasp. He said it was shingles. I just thought I was tired and run down so I did not give any thought to the pain symptoms haha. Shortly after that I went on a date and wore a singlet that did not cover the scabby rash. My date asked what it was and I was so embarrassed to tell them it was shingles. I thought they would be disgusted and think it was an STI Luckily they would recently been waiting at a doctor's office and read a pamphlet on the topic. Years later I had another outbreak but realised what it was in time. There was very little rash but other typical pain symptoms. I am grateful that I was only in my 20s therefore basically invincible compared to now decades later. I had chickenpox when I was 5. I assume I have had the MMR vaccine when I was very young but do not know how to check. I am Australian just mentioning in case it is helpful in some way. With good humour I am assuming I will get shingles again at some stage. Hopefully I will not have a hard time next bout
6874,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: To me first was worse than second.
6880,GenX Shingrix: I had my first shingrix shot with a TDAP shot and had nothing more than a sore arm. Second shot also minimal soreness.
6881,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Dude. I'm 51 and have never had chicken pox. I have to get a vaccine from the health department. My doctor doesn't know if I then have to get a shingles vaccine cause the kids who got the chickenpox vaccine aren't old enough to get shingles.
6884,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I Am 32 and had shingles earlier this year. It was so uncomfortable and it came on the week after I recovered from what felt like COVID again. It really is a sneaky bastard.
6887,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: Yep same. I Have had 5 shots and now each time just know and plan to be down and out for a few days.
6892,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I Have had internal shingles it started on one side and then went to the other. Its one of the worst pains I Have ever had and I broke a hip and walked around in it for a month when I was 49. I got vaccine as soon as I could.
6897,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine even if you have to pay. Got it on my face and in my right eye in 2023. The burning the blisters the scabs the scars the nerve damage the right eye that is always blurry because of scars on my eyeball the possibility of blindness stroke deafness and a whole slew of other random things.... JUST GET THE VACCINE
6901,Shingles and GenX: A couple months back I had my 4th covid vaccine and a Shingles vaccine at the same time. While it was not exactly fun it was not that bad.
6902,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I Have never had the vaccine I Am not quite 50 yet but I would absolutely choose a 3week flare vs the severe blinding pain of actual shingles which also lasts for weeks. My fatherinlaw had shingles and was writhing in pain for weeks. Could Not sleep or eat. The vaccine which he took after just made him fatigued.
6903,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Thanks let us hope. First just gave me dead arm
6905,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: I gave it to my 29 weeker when it was available to her and she is ok
6907,2nd shot of shingles vaccine worse then the first.
6911,RSVP vaccine and others: This My pediatrician said she saw a huge decrease in RSV cases in infants since the vaccine and the ones that did get were much less severe. I had two friends whose babies got RSV before the vaccine and they were in the hospital for weeks on oxygen. That Is all I needed to make my decision.
6912,Frequent urination began in June 2023. I currently urinate more than 10 times daily. Do not drink coffee tea or alcohol. Clear urine no pain no blood no burning sensation normal flow. Recently started waking up once a night to urinate. Yellowish jellylike lumps in seminal fluid. Unknown onset. Ejaculate has a liquid consistency. Prior to the onset of frequent urination I had recurrent right eye infection that was linked to stress and disappeared after 3 months. Blood tests for autoimmune diseases Negative. Accompanying Symptoms Lower back pain when lifting heavy objects. Occurred at the same time as the frequent urination. Old poor hygiene habit Using the same toilet paper to wipe the penis head after defecation. Sexual health 1. I have had multiple sexual male partners more than 10 in the past 2 years 2. Received fellatio without protection 3. Negative tests Chlamydia gonorrhea HIV syphilis hepatitis B and C April 2024. 4. Received vaccines for HPV and Hepatitis A and B April 2024 First urologist September 2024 Ultrasound with a full bladder 1.

6913,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: This is what I meant in terms of effect noted on dysplasia. There are a few similar studies. As you noted however the vaccine is not yet licensed as a therapeutic. In my own case anecdotally taking it while i had active hpv did not end my genital warts infection. But perhaps other things would have been different.
6914,Put me out of my misery.: Got my first singles shot the day after my 50th birthday. My boomer brother called me a week later to say he had shingles Told my boomer sister to go get her shot and she made all kinds of vaccine excuses. Enjoy your inevitable case of shingles I guess. Got the tiniest puncture wound on my hand from a tack 2 days ago. I was at the pharmacy the next day for a tetanus booster TDaP and threw in flu covid and pneumonia just for funsies. Typing this with two sore arms Better than shingles covid flu pneumonia tetanus diptheria and pertussis Hail science
6916,Guess what? You have to do it again in 5 yrs. I had it when it first came out in 20182019. Had to fight like hell to get the shot. I am starting to have shingles outbreaks again so both my insurance and doctor said I have to have it again after 5 yrs.
6919,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I did not have a reaction to the first but did to the second. Other people have told me they had it the other way reacted to the first but not the second. In any case its better than getting shingles and enduring months of pain.
6922,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Follow up question for those who have gotten the vaccine how did you feel after? I need to schedule mine but I need to know if I am going to need the weekend to recover from it feeling lousy. TIA.
6924,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: Me too A hot compress and ibuprofen helped. Still better than shingles
6925,"vaccines before new meds: I'm not here to debate about the efficacy of vaccines, so I won't respond to comments about that. I just want to know if anyone else's doctor has recommended the same vaccines mine has. I'm (possibly) stating Orencia. I'm off my previous med. As part of the prescribing process my doctor recommended Shingrix for Shingles and Prevnar13 for pneumonia. I went to the pharmacy to get them. They wouldn't give me the Shingrix without a doctor's order, so I am waiting for the doctor to send that. But my insurance wouldn't cover the Prevnar13. The website says this vaccine is for people over 65 and people with ""certain medical conditions."" I'm 40. Usually people my age get a different pneumonia vaccine, Pneumovax23. The doctor said that Prevnar13 was needed for immunocompromised people, but the fact that my insurance won't cover it makes me think that it's not really the standard of care. I am fortunate to have pretty good insurance. Has anyone else under 65 been told to get Prevnar13? Did your insurance cover it?"
6928,Shingles shot: I put off getting my first shot because of all the bitching and moaning right here in rGenX. Not even a sore arm. No reaction whatsoever. Do not let all the bitching on here prevent you from getting the shot.
6930,31 yr old male: I found out today that the vaccine is a live version of shingles and will make you sick for 3 weeks or more. After that you have general weakness and fatigue. The guy I spoke to does not know how long it lasts because he is still going through it. He is an EMT.
6933,I am a 28 year old guy. So I tested positive for hsv1 last week because I requested blood work. I am asymptomatic. I had been in talks with my fianc and got engaged 2 months ago. I also contracted genital warts which is due to a strain not covered by the vaccine because I took all doses of the HPV vaccine and still got warts. I thought mentally I would be able to deal with warts and that being young I would be able to clear the HPV in 23 years. Prior to meeting my wife I was promiscuous and made stupid decisions about not wearing a condom at times because I got trapped by my mind in the heat of the moment and I am suffering now. I told my fianc about my herpes and hpv status. She was accepting of the hpv status and said that it will most likely go away in 23 years by the time she arrives in the US. She lives internationally so it will take some time for her to come her. I was ok with the prospect of waiting. Telling her about my hsv1 diagnosis took a huge hit on my mental and physical health. I feel emotionally dead and like my life with her is over. I love my fianc so much but since said that hsv1 is associated with oral herpes she is fine with that that is where the problem is. I do not know if I only have oral herpes or genital hsv1 as well because I have been asymptomatic The fact that this virus is transmissible during asymptomatic phases is mentally driving me insane. I have become so depressed and suicidal over the past 2 weeks and losing interest in my career. I am a med student by the way. And I am feeling like I destroyed my life. I am scared to lose her I do not know who else will come in my life because I am from a Muslim family and it is hard to come across Muslim females with hsv and it is looked down upon so much particularly in Muslim society. I feel like there is few like me in my situation and it is eating me from here inside. I cry almost everyday thinking about my mistakes and I want to move past and be able to have a marriage and have kids but I feel like I shot myself on the foot. I do not know what to do I am crying as I type this It took a lot in me to reveal my diagnosis to my fianc because I did not want to put her through harm. I love her so much. But now she is under the assumption that I only have oral herpes with hsv1 because that is what is classically associated with it. But I do not know whether I might have it genitally too since I have never had an outbreak. She stated she is ok with possibly contracting oral herpes but cannot CANNOT settle with the idea of getting genital herpes. She said that to me yesterday and my suicidal thoughts resurfaced again. I had a severe mental breakdown after listening to her say that. I did not delve deep in terms of telling her that there is a risk of her contracting genitally and I have heard that if I had genital hsv1 it is much harder to transmit genital to genital so it is typically low risk but there is one nonetheless. I already had so much difficulty and pain revealing her about having hsv1 but now with her not wanting to have risk of getting genital herpes I am feeling dead. Nothing to me is enjoyable I spend time in my bed crying about my ruined love life. I made huge mistakes in the past I admit it But I feel like I am being punished severely with 2 Stis that are incurable. I am going through a really difficult time so please I need help
6936,I Am sick I have a bad headache and cold symptoms and have a 34 week preemie that is a month and a half adjusted. Hes scheduled for the RSV antibody shot next week was the earliest they can get him in since hes came home from the nicu.i am wearing a mask and washing my hands and using hand sanitizer to the point my hands are damn near peeling. I Am so worried my LO is going to end up sick. I Have had the flu shot and TDAP while pregnant and actually was sick with Covid while pregnant and hes got his first round of vaccines just not the RSV yet since our pediatrician does not have it. I did not get the RSV shot pregnant because I was not planning on delivering early..No real point of this post other than I feel like a horrible mom. I have not gone anywhere but the grocery store once or twice and the pediatricians office and around my mother in law who was not sick. I Am so worried my baby is going to get sick and die. Why did I even leave the house to go to the store? I Am never going to forgive myself if he does get sick.
6941,Overall health in danger?: Yes Stress could be a factor and often nothing is obviously wrong but it does not hurt to get a check up. I Am not as young as you and I was very surprised when I got shingles the first time then I found out a few months later that I had cancer. I Am going through shingles for the second time right now and I Have already made an appointment with my doctor. I think this time it might be because of major back problems but I want tests done.
6942,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I still have PHN and I got shingles in 2018. I will say that it is better than it used to be and lately only hurts when the weather changes. When I Have gotten sick with covid its flared up significantly.
6943,It is no fun at all Shingles is worse. My aunt had shingles and it was horrible. My dad had the vaccine and got shingles. It was extremely mild. He barely knew he had them
6946,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Sore arm and a little bit of malaise. No fever headache anything just feeling odd and tired.
6947,Pretty long term side effects in ears curious if anyone has also experienced: I had shingles on my back this past April. It resolved visually in June but was still quite painful itchy until August. It continues to be itchy to a lesser degree.
6948,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shots are SO WORTH IT I had shingles on my head face down to my ears. It was beyond horrible. Two years later still dealing with the after effects from shingles. Get the shots
6950,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: We had them when I was a kid by the time my son came along they had the chickenpox vaccine sow we got that for him. My brother got shingles so bad he was almost suicidal so I ran out and got the shingles vaccine as fast as I could. Real vaccines are great experimental DNA modifiers are poison.
6951,My father had 3 Covid shots 3 serious AEFIs. His MD filed a report after the first PH responded that shingles is not a recognized AEFI The last shot took away his ability to walk control bladderbowel function live independently. We would like to help care for him pls.
6953,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never had chicken pox was vaccinated and currently have shingles. Doctor told even with vaccine I probably got pox in a very mild form and did not know it.
6954,I have had the pfeizer ones. I have had zero reactions to any vaccine ever besides maybe a little tired but that is probably more my head not a real symptom. I have gotten all my shingles pneumonia doneI do flu shots annually because it is my health I want to protect.
6955,I have been putting off my flu etc because of this fear but will get it done. I have a client facing office where I might sit across the desk from 1012 peeps a day and have been 3 years no fluxoldcovid completely dreading my second shingles shot first one was killer.
6956,Screenings or vaccines before biologics?: I would highly recommend the shingles vaccine. I did not get it before going on immunosuppressant s and came down with a bad case of shingles that scarred my face.
6958,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Shingles is not always bad. A couple years ago my husband had a small rash about the size of a quarter. It did not hurt did not itch nothing. But it annoyed him that it was there for a couple weeks. He got a telehealth appointment and the doctor looked at it over Zoom then had him go right in so the doctor would verify what he thought it was since he was not expecting to see shingles in a young person. Well it was shingles. My husband never had a single pox mark as a kid. He was asymptomatic to the point that he thought he never had chicken pox. There was nothing the doctor could do since there was no pan or anything but did tell him to stay away from people who had not had chickenpox or the vaccine. Oops. Our daughter has a legit medical exemption to most vaccines due to the severity of her reactions to the few she is had I also react so horribly that I have no intention of ever getting another vaccinehospitalized twice from vaccine reactions. Poor dear spend her 12th birthday with chickenpox which sucked. She had measles a few years prior. Though I got Covid thrice including being one of the 2019 cases she never got that but did get the vaccine which made her so incredibly sick that fuck anyone who tells me she should get boosters because what about granny.
6959,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Fractured skull and concussion no lingering symptoms. Alive and well.
6960,In their own docs an adverse reaction to Pfizer vaccine is blistering skin eruption. Many folk are also getting herpes and shingles quickly or some time after their covid vaccine It is all a cover up another attempt by them to inject more toxins into folk restrict freedoms.
6963,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I was in a lot of pain for five days. I would do it again. Shingles can be horrific.
6965,First shingles vaccine side effects: I just had my first one this morning. So far so good but I am still expecting the worst. How are you doing now and how long was it before you felt the side effects?
6966,21 year old LSIL  hpv positive: Its too late to prevent the strain you have with the vaccine. But it can force your body to produce antibodies that may help it fight the strain you have. It can also help prevent other strains in the future. So its good you got it. You do not really need to stress about being positive until 30. The body has a high chance of clearing or knocking it into dormancy before 30. I had LSIL at 26 and got rid of it. I now have HPV again at 34. Not sure if its a reactivation of the strain I had at 26 or a new one. But I am getting the updated vaccine series beginning tomorrow. The version of it I got as a teen only covered 4 strains instead of 9. They Will only send you immediately to colposcopy if its strain 16 or 18. Otherwise they will wait 12 months. If you are still HPV positive at that point they typically send you to colposcopy as a precaution. But roughly 60 clear in 1 year and 90 clear by 2 years. Consider adding vitamins to your diet. I just started a regimen of 6 daily supplements Ill be taking for a minimum of 6 months. Also waiting on colposcopy results. I promise this is not a death sentence. HPV is so common that an estimated 90 of the sexually active population will come into contact with it at some point in life. Would suggest your current partner also getting the vaccine along with though. Regardless of who gave it to who you both likely share this strain now. Condoms unfortunately do not do much in terms of protecting against sharing it.
6971,Exactly Me too No flu No Covid And No RSV 3 years ago my Dr talked me into the Shingles vaccine right after I took a Covid my SIL has cancer so we were told it was necessary. Ended up with heart issues and in the hospital. Never again
6973,Just did this yesterday with Shingrix it is a great idea if you do not like feeling sick or having horrible rashes when you are 50
6975,Shingles vaccine: I had it. My uncle died of shingles. It should not be that expensive contact Glaxo Smith they have programs that will reduce or eliminate the cost of The injection is no biggie. And you just need to rest after getting the injections.
6980,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Chicken pox as a young boomer and for some reason the lesions became horribly infected and I wound up hospitalized with eventual scarring. Plus not long ago I got a nasty case of shingles with painful and maybe permanent sequellae. Kids should be vaccinated for chicken pox whenever possible.
6982,"Medical exemption for varicella vaccine in nursing school?: Hey! I just got accepted to nursing school and was looking at their required vaccines. My problem is that they require 2 varicella vaccines and I only had 1. I can't get the second because it's a live vaccine and I take methotrexate and a biologic. Is it possible to get a medical exemption? I swear I'm not an antivax moron. I've got all of my other vaccines and would get this one if I could, but I've already been told by my gastroenterologist and infectious disease doc that live vaccines are unacceptable. Update: Thanks for the advice! I did get a titer ordered by my primary care, but they said with my medical history and immune suppression they'd be surprised if I was positive. So I guess we can hope the clinical sites cooperate, or I get to go back to the infectious disease team and try to figure how to vaccinate me without killing me... Maybe I could delay methotrexate doses or something. Tbh, I'd like to figure out how to safely get the shot and develop antibodies. The last thing I was is to be an immunocompromised nurse working directly with patients with a contagious disease that I could be vaccinated for. I know I'll be working with infectious patients, but if there's a vaccine for the illness they have I'd strongly prefer to get it. For their sake and mine."
6985,RSV vaccine?: I got the RSV antibodies for my son at his 6 month appointment and were doing flu vaccine next week. He was definitely fussier than he normally is after his 24 month vaccines but not outrageously so. To me its worth it especially since I Am in healthcare and would hate to expose him to something and him get terribly ill and feel like i did not do everything i could to protect him. Like others have said  diseases are worse than vaccines. Ill take 12 days of fussiness over a hospitalization.
6989,Hi all. I was on Wegovy for 7 months and loved it. I lost about 20 pounds and the food noise went away. I wanted to share some of the negative I experienced that are not mentioned often or as a symptom of the medication. 1. I got gastritis 2x. The 2nd time which was the worst one was so bad I had blood in my stool. I was throwing up and the pain was SO BAD. This was what ultimately made me stop taking the meds. 2. I get shingles occasionally but on this medication I had shingle flare ups every month after 3 months on the medication. I ended up staying on Acyclovir the last 3 months breakout dose consistently. I am married to an ER doctor so that helped me to get treatment I needed and fast. So I wanted to share my experience with you all in case it helps anyone.
6990,I had a very sore arm with Shingles shot 2. However I was more scared to get Shingles than Covid. My mother had a horrible experience with Shingles. Have a shot
6996,Brave. That shingles shot was the worst ever. Worse than any Covid shot
6997,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Had shingles in my face twice now. it is the worst.
7002,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Maybe a little senility kicking OP. There are only 9
7003,My baby boy is a week old am I crazy to not want an 8 year old holding him?: You are not crazy. My son is almost 4 months old and I have still only allowed his grandparents to hold him just a few days ago lol. If you are in the states they offer an RSV vaccine called Beyfortus. I got it for my son before I let his grandparents hold him. I will not be letting my nieces  nephews or school age siblings all ranging from ages 5 to 13 hold him. I find it unnecessary to be honest. I mean why do we need to pass babies around like toys? They are people who deserve to be protected and not overstimulated by being passed around to the whole family. That is my 2 cents. Not saying others are wrong in what they choose to do this is just how I feel personally. So I do not think you are crazy.
7005,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Have fun with that my mother in law skipped her Covid booster because her daughter was telling her its bad for you. She then got Covid and it caused a mini stroke. It took her months to recover and she will never be quite the same again.
7011,Glad you are feeling better. Yep the Shingles vaccine and booster were not fun. I Am doing the flu and Covid vaccine Friday. Planned it so I could have the weekend in case I do not feel well.
7012,Shingles vaccine experience: I had zero side effects from either vaccine but my grandmother died from complications after having a colostomy bag due to shingles. No comparison. People need to stop being such wussies about vaccine side effects anyway. Most are not as bad as a simple flu and we all survive a virus or two per year. Suck it up.
7015,Shingles vaccine: Friend got shingles and was in so much pain. Re the shot my only advice is to not get it at the same time as a covid booster. I did that with the first shingrix and it knocked me on my butt. Second shot gotten solo no biggie.
7024,Hi all 26F 250 lbs 58 no other medical issues besides the lack of gallbladder I have taking Zoloft 100mg and a post natal vitamin. I have some weird bumps on my knee that do not hurt only a little when touched and slightly itchy. Picture in comments have had them slowly spreading more for a little over a month. I asked my mother what she thought it could be and she said shingles? Which freaks me out because I have a 11 month old baby and do not want her to catch anything. What do you think? What should I do?
7027,Just got all those and shingles vaccine too I cried a bit.
7028,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Lots of preemies have small setbacks with other vaccines but that is much more rare with the RSV shot. The new one Beyfortus is amazing compared to the older one synagis which required monthly injections for the entire respiratory virus season my NICU grad twins had that during their first and second RSV seasons and while they never had actual side effects the monthly shots suuuucked. Kept them healthy though My 6 month old full term no NICU was able to get Beyfortus this year had no side effects and stayed healthy when RSV was confirmed in our house 2 weeks later and she has crappy lungs and had to be hospitalized for respiratory issues twice before she got the Beyfortus. I am 100 sure that she would have needed another hospital stay if she did not have the shot
7031,About one month ago I was out of work for 2 weeks with shingles. I had a rash under my right breast. At the time it was probably a 410 in terms of pain. I was extremely tired and slept a lot for the first week. I was given anti viral medication but no pain relief. This past week I have been experiencing shoulder and back pain just around from where the rash was. I have been extremely fatigued as I am in constant pain and discomfort. I have felt as though my immune system has been completely shot since having shingles  I have been getting frequent headaches and a stuffy nose. I have tried heated gels ibuprofen and a massage gun on a low setting to try and ease the pain and tightness in my shoulder to no avail. Does anyone have any tips  advice ?
7033,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had no ill effects from either shingles shot.
7037,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Pretty sure I was vaccinated and still ended up getting it from a friend in grade school. Lol
7038,Shingles vaccine: I think everyone is different. I got the covid flu and second shingles on the same day. No effects other than a little soreness in my shoulders.
7039,The shingles vaccine is 2dose. The first is nbd but most people have a much stronger reaction to the second dose. That is how you know it is workingyour body recognizes it. I am glad I got it and my husband and I took turns pampering each other after our second doses
7040,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Ugh yikes. I can get wasted even from a flu shot and the covid was beyond horror. To hear people saying it is even worse than the covid shot????????
7042,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles at 35 as a result of stress on my immune system from another infection. Early onset Shingles is on the rise among Gen X and older millennials because were a weird vestigial demographic group who got chicken pox but is no longer regularly exposed to the chicken pox virus as a result of the vaccine that was rolled out in the 90s. Our immune systems recharge themselves when they are exposed to old familiar pathogens. They forgot how to fix the chicken pox virus which is a form of herpes after so many years without reminders from the circulating virus. Were all going to have to get regular shingles vaccines as we get olde r
7043,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Thank you for sharing this We had a baby back in September and in October opted for him to get the RSV vaccine. Lo and behold the holidays come around and a family member had RSV unknowingly passed it to our older daughter 3 who then passed it to our 3 month old. Our pediatrician mentioned that he really dodged a bullet and we saw it first hand. Our oldest battled it for 10 days straight with horrible symptoms while our little one had half the symptoms. We are lucky to have had the access to the vaccine and even luckier that all the kids made it through
7044,Shingles at 35: Ugh I am so sorry. I went to my pcp office last Monday for nerve pain and awful itching localized into one area of my body. I checked all the shingles boxes just not the veyy try obvious rash. The dr said he did not know what was up and sent me home with Benadryl lidocaine patches topical steroid cream and a topical NSAID. Said come back in a few weeks if its not better. Id told him the Benadryl and NSAIDs were not working and he said here have some. Benadryl So later in the day I went to urgent care and she said shingles. I got the antiviral meds steroids and hydroxyzine. Now a week later I Am mostly better. Its crazy that some docs just do not seem to understand or care.
7045,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: Beyfortus was not around when my nicu twins were babies but they got Synagis for one and two years respectively and did great with it. I definitely credit it with keeping them both out of the hospital during that time because they were prone to ongoing respiratory issues with any minor virus and we know RSV tends not to be minor in infants. My current term baby is 5 months old and she got Beyfortus this year no issues or side effects for her either. The NICU where I work is giving Beyfortus to any consented baby a few days or so before discharge and while the season is not over yet last week our leadership announced that NICU grad readmissions for RSV were down a decent percent this year
7050,i know the length of this looks overwhelming but the bulk of it is describing symptoms. I have been having a pretty rough time. F22 in the middle of august i had an upper respiratory infection that was treated with antibiotics. i recovered from the infection but after finishing the antibiotics i started getting significant nerve pain in a spot in my back that i had shingles in seven years ago. i thought i was going to have another breakout as i have recurring shingles but a rash never erupted. a dermatologist suspected that it was postherpetic neuralgia. then from sepdec i experienced a whole slew of symptoms widespread nerve pain. the patch on my back is the most consistent area of nerve pain the others are fairly random. i get burning tickling poking and electriclike sensations all over. i honestly feel like a voodoo doll and someone is just repeatedly poking me with a small needle lol. an area of skin will also sometimes feel like it is wet when it is completely dry bladder issues. i went from urinating normally to suddenly having to pee 15 times a day. there will also be times where i will pee wait a few minutes to make sure that is everything and after a minute or two of being away from the toilet I PISS MYSELF. it is always been a small amount but it is involuntary and i have no urge to do so. I have had three UAs with cultures within the sepdec timeframe. no infection but small presence of blood each time achy body. some days i feel okay others my body feels physically sick. weakheavy limbs back and neck pain specifically in joints consistent low grade fevers. i usually sit at 97.1F and when I am experiencing symptoms i sit at 99.5F. cognitive changes. started slow and got worse. difficulty focusing cannot think deeplycritically bad memory near constant state of confusion. i was struggling to do basic dimensional analysis at work at one point when i do it on a daily basis. i felt like i had no idea what i was doing and it was very confusingfrustrating. i had to stop driving for a month and took three weeks off of work because i cannot afford to make a big mistake in my line of work occasional difficulty with speech. I will be talking and then it is like there is a sudden block preventing me from thinkingspeaking. i will also randomly start stuttering or will almost have a lisp when I am speaking never had speech problems before. the lisp is more rare and usually goes away quickly. occasional difficulty swallowing. it is frickin weird man. the worst is when I am taking my meds because my body is like nope cannot swallow these. hold these pills as they start to disintegrate into your mouth and then try to force yourself to swallow. dizziness clumsiness vertigo. i will think I am walkingmoving just fine but bump into things constantly. cannot stand in one place without swaying back and forth. DROPPING THINGS like crazy i will think i have a grasp on something and then it suddenly drops to the ground eye and ear pain. I will get tinnitus in one or both ears and pain behind one or both of my eyes. will also have moments where i am involuntarily blinking or double blinking. rarely will also have blurry vision or my central vision will be focused and my peripheral is significantly more blurry shakiness. usually just in my hands but I will sometimes feel like my head is very slightly bobbing?? limbs randomly falling asleep without because. i will also feel like there is a tight band around my upper arm that makes the rest of my arm weak. sometimes experience carpal tunnellike syndrome as well. i remember waking up once and feeling mildly numb all over limbs torso face. extreme pain inatop ribs. does not appear to be associated with organs below it is fairly superficial. this has only happened 34 times but it hurts much worse than my typical nerve pain. I have only experienced it on the front side of my chest and it is happened on both the left and the right side. feels like very intense burning and i have to stop everything I am doing until it passes usually lasts a few minutes rashes. suddenly developed a mild allergy to the sun but it went away when i was doing better towards mid december. almost every day I would get an intense flushing feeling and would be red across my cheeks and neck for the next few hours. developed a pinprick rash around my abdomen as well that was present for 1.5 months. would also get other sporadic red dots around body but they looked different than the pinprick ones there are other symptoms but obviously this list is long and these are the most notable ones. I have seen a few different doctors and have been working with my PCP and immunologist to get answers. i have a history of medical problems that do not appear to have any correlation. I have had more bloodwork done in the last 45 months than I have had in my entire lifetime. i did have a faint positive ANA test with negative characterization for things they were concerned about but we redid the ANA test 1.5 months ago and it was negative. also tested negative for celiacs vasculitis mashimotos and MCAS. i was very concerned about a bad vitamin b deficiency as i follow a plantbased diet but all of my vitamin and metal levels are normal. i do b12 injections every two weeks and take a handful of supplements all approved by my PCP. i was on gabapentin to help with the nerve pain but it made my cognitive symptoms 10x worse while only partially helping with pain. i started low dose naltrexone early december and noticed a difference within two weeks. started going to physical therapy to address scoliosis my PCP was wondering if that was contributing to the nerve pain but both my PT and i disagree. i was doing incredibly well for the remainder of the month and into january up until a few days ago. my brother is in what we believe to be a drug induced psychosis and it has created a lot of stressanxiety for me. we have been getting him help but dealing with his erratic behaviors has been incredibly hard. i started having more nerve pain and now other symptoms have been tacking on sudden bladder issues cognitive problems fatigue stiffness in neck etc. I am so afraid that I am going to have another full blown episode of what happened from sepdecember it was awful and I am crying just thinking about it happening again. i was able to get a referral to a neurologist in november as i felt my PCP was not able to help me beyond ordering blood tests and trying different meds. they were booked out for awhile but i do have an appointment at the beginning of february. i really want to get an MRI and do a tilt table test as i have concerns about POTS as well. i do not know. the brief uphill that i was on and subsiding of symptoms was so nice. i was finally feeling like myself again. I am trying not to think I am having a relapse but at some capacity i feel greatly defeated. has anyone experienced symptoms like these and received a diagnosis? a lot of the symptoms seem to correlate with MS but i do not want to automatically jump to that without having an MRI done. i was hoping it was something momentary i am terrified of having this as a long term condition. thank you to anyone for taking the time to read this i truly appreciate it. 3
7052,Shingles vaccine at 27?: Yeah just get it your immunocompromised which makes you more susceptible to it also a bunch of meds that we can end up on could set it off. My brother was 24 and he got shingles said the pain was unbearable could not sleep for 3 days. Definitely take it its just peace of mind.
7053,Just took my first dose about 20 minutes ago. What should I expect today?: My first dose did not feel like anything. After a few doses the food noise started getting quiet. I have had zero negative side effects.
7057,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Usual disclaimer no one can provide specific medical advice for a person or condition without an inperson interview and physical examination and a review of the available medical records and recent and past testing. This comment is for general information purposes only and not intended to provide medical advice. No physicianpatient relationship is implied or established. The vaccine uses to primarily prevent chickenpox is not the same as the vaccine that is used to prevent shingles. The first is a live attenuated virus. This means it is the virus itself that has been manipulated to prevent it from being Dangerous. But it is a virus and in some cases it can because a mild case of shingles. This is not a particularly puzzling event.
7058,I have been in a pain clinic.I am good with pill counts and UA.I go every month.also the reason why I am there is do to shingles.when the shingles healed I still was in a ton of pain.I was told the shingles virus caused the coating on some nerves on my abdomen.its called postherpatic neralha.I cannot spell it sorry. I have been taking two types of morphine.one is extended release and the second is a immediately release.about two years ago i was told to taper off not completely but it was half of what I was taking.I told them I could not go anymore down because I was in tears while my body got use to the lower dose.it took two years to get my life in order. Now last month I was told my doctor was leaving and this new doctor is telling me to taper aginmy old doctor told me that he would not taper me anymore.but now hes gone I have no choice.also they told me that they wanted me to switch to either butomorphine or subyoutec.these two meds are given to people with a substance abuse disorder.I do not have that.this may sound upsetting but I do not want to have either of those drugs in my medical records due to any medical person looking at my records is going to think I have or are being treated for substance abuse disorder.I received enough judgment I do not want anything more. I have been stable all these years and have been through all kinds of treatments.I cannot have antidepressants or ultram.they caused seizures every time I took them.i would have no seizures when I was off the meds.then I was placed on them again and I would have a seizure about hour or so after taking the meds.I have no history of seizures.I had all the work up and nothing.so I was told not to take the meds. I am JUST SO ANGRY I am AFRAID THE LIFE THAT I WORKED SO HARD TO GET WILL FALL APART I would like to thank everyone for such good and inspiring messages.it means a lot I will post another update after my upcoming appointment.
7060,RSV Vaccine???? because: Did they say how young they are allowed to get them? I have a 2 month old why receives her first round of vaccines this week. I wonder if she can get RSV too
7061,Shingrix Dose 1 Injection Site Reaction
7062,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My Mum had shingles earlier in the year. Never seen her in so much pain she had them on her ribs and even breathing hurt. She was nearly crying every time I called her and was just laying on her bed trying to sleep all the time. That said it is nothing less than Trish deserves. To purposely give a child chickenpox is one thing my mum took me round to my cousins to get it and it was cool for me because we then got to spend our time off together scratching and ayimg games on Sky TV. That being said it was done with everyone is permission and not to a baby. Vaccinations or not I would be fuming if someone purposely infected my son. I would be even MORE fuming if they then justified it with such lame excuses as it is natural.
7066,"Vaccine Experience: My Journey with the Moderna Vaccine Hello everyone, I wanted to share my experience with the Moderna vaccine and the health complications I've faced since receiving it. Prior to getting my first dose, I was in good health but after the vaccine, I started experiencing severe fatigue and joint pain. Following the second dose, my symptoms worsened, and I was eventually diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia. Despite numerous tests and consultations with specialists, no one has been able to provide a clear explanation for my deteriorating health. Any advice or tips on managing these conditions would be greatly appreciated."
7067,Shingles with PHN after: I have been reading a lot lately about shingles in general. And primarily because I just contracted my first ever severe outbreak. I know you realize this but you were really lucky that you did not lose your vision. And thank goodness you were on top of it.. You mentioned you got the postherpetic neuralgia PHN. Like you I did as well because my rashes did not show up until 2 weeks after that agonizing off the charts' physical pain. They missed the 72hour window for the antiviral medication. So here I am into my 5th week and every new day that comes I wonder if it will be over. I have been to the hospital 4 times and within the first 2 weeks of it starting one of those visits they kept me 4 days. I was also to my primary twice. I have had a lot of symptoms and lingering effects if you will. I know you mentioned getting the vaccine. Though in my situation I am not able to do so as I was diagnosed with a rare disease 2 years ago titled Burning Mouth Syndrome. And because of the type I have and also the fact that I have under lying illnesses such as ulcerative colitis Fibromygia RSD and trigeminal neuralgia. Anything and everything vaccines medications nutritional deficiency taking herbal supplements and a ton of other things can because me to go into a flare. My Burning Mouth Syndrome is rarer than the norm because when I get a flareup I can get it in one of two different patterns which I have nicknamed Mild Mary and Horrific Harry from HELL. The names say it all. Burning Mouth Syndrome specifically the ugly one is nothing that I could have imagined that I was able to survive and live to talk about it. My adult son described it in comparison to being tortured in a prison camp. Good luck and also thank you for your service. P.S. thank you for listening
7072,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got both shots earlier this year and had no reaction. Just a little sore at the injection site for a day
7073,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had shingles on my knee as a teenager. I first thought the scabs were insect bites since I camped a lot back then. Then a few days later the skin on my knee began to tighten and my knee began to throb. Had to take shots and apply some ointment. The shingles went away in a few weeks. I assume that I am now less likely to get shingles as I grow older.
7074,I was just bedridden for the last few days because I got shingles again. I first had them in 2021 then 2022 opposite side most likely just residual shingles that were feeling left out? and then severe post herpetic neuralgia. I have been off work since Christmas of 2023. Basically slept for 20 hours a day from December until May and have been making slow strides at getting better. Nerve pain has healed but now I Am dealing with a lot of muscle weakness brain fog and cognitive issues. We suspected that my poor immunity and everything else was due to long covid and I had a referral for the long covid clinic in my province Alberta Canada but the government abruptly shut everything down. I was super excited about the possibility of returning to work next month due to some very extensive physio kinesiology therapy and other work that I was doing. Unfortunately I found a weird pimple on my face that eventually spread and was diagnosed with shingles. Again. I was prescribed Acyclovir cream and realized that some weird rashes I had in my back were likely shingles that I have not realized less painful than my first bout of shingles. I finally took a shower today with my contacts on I am 10 lol and realized how widespread the rashes actually were. There are dark spots in a clear band around my hips and waist. This will undoubtedly set me back for my return to work and I Am sad. My therapist said that my excitement for a return basically made me overlook a lot of stress that I was going through. I have ADHD and I am really bad at gauging stress levels and not hyperfixating and neglecting my health. Anyways I Am sorry if this was all over the place. Thanks for reading my rant I really hoped I would never get shingles again and now I am disappointed and sad that I will not get to return to work. I am trying to not be so hard on myself but it sucks. The doctor at the walk in clinic told me to see a specialist because I am 28 and should not be getting shingles so often and I was like yeah dude I am very aware lol.
7083,RSV vaccine for infants.: We got it for our baby at 6 months when it was first available. Unfortunately hes almost 11 months now and has RSV. Its pretty mild though so I am glad he maybe has some protection from the vaccine.
7084,I am very worried about my husband's and children's health possible shingles: My husband (36) has had horrid rash that hurts for 2 weeks and we are pretty sure it is shingles just from googling symptoms and images of shingles. Today on top of the horrid icky shingle looking rash he has tiny little bumps all over that looks like hives or maybe chicken pox even. We have 4 kids living at home all of them have gotten chicken pos vaccine should I be concerned about them catching it? I had shingles in my teen years should I be concerned with catching it again? He hasn't been to the doctor yet we don't have copay money for urgent care his work insurance has really high copays so he rarely uses it.
7087,Shingles: I had shingles in my late 40s. Had not been diagnosed with Crohns yet. Doctor said I should look into the vaccine but then backtracked and said I would not be eligible until 50. A nurse friend said You are kind of young to be getting shingles. Almost makes me wonder if there is an autoimmune disorder at play. A couple of years later when I was diagnosed with Crohns I realized he was right. I do not know if having been through Shingles makes me less likely to get it again but I made sure to get the vaccine when I was old enough. Getting Shingles once was enough for me.
7093,Just had antipneumonia vaccine Covid and Flu Covid for the 5th or 6th time lost count in a week or two and Shingles in December. Walking dead Note I Am aware that a very few people do have reactions to vaccines but the benefits vastly outweigh the risks
7098,20 F with shingles even though I was vaccinated and have never had chickenpox: This sub is seeing more and more cases of young people who have had the vaccine but not chickenpox and got shingles myself included. The vaccine is live so the virus ends up living dormant in your nerves forever just like people who got chickenpox and sometimes it wakes up .
7100,Did you get shingles after your COVID vaccine and wonder how that was possible. Or you have had sniffle after sniffle since getting it..... because it destroyed your immune system. Good luck with shingles the revenge.
7102,Oh man I feel this so much My experience was identical to yours. The booster was not as bad but I think it helped that I was mega prepared. Ill say though that my sister during her last bout with shingles lost 19 pounds and some of her eyesight.
7103,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Kicked my ass for a couple of days but I got it because one of my coworkers ended up being hospitalized over shingles.
7104,RSVP vaccine and others: Yes this anti vaccine thing is insane I got the RSV vaccine around 32 weeks pregnant and then my husband actually ended up getting RSV when I was 36 weeks pregnant and he was absolutely miserable He had a hacking cough for almost 3 weeks straight was bedridden for a week almost had to be hospitalized Meanwhile I was totally fine and did not even have any side effects from the vaccine. I cannot imagine being so heavily pregnant and then dealing with being that sick at the same time. And it really scares me to think about my tiny baby dealing with that I genuinely do not understand how so many people would rather get so sick and rather their babies get so sick than just get vaccines. In my opinion and experience vaccines are like the greatest thing. I cannot imagine going back in time and telling someone with polio or the Spanish influenza that a vaccine exists but you decided not to take it???
7106,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Stupid me forgot about it and got shingles on the upper right side of my face at 54. I have a couple pock marks around my eye for my trouble. Yes I got the vaccine now.
7111,Shingles vaccine: I got both shots last year you get one and then another after a few months. Apart from a sore arm I did not have any side effects. I Am not sure where you live but here in Arkansas Walmart and Walgreens both give it for free if you are over a certain age 50 I think. Mine were free..no requirement for insurance or anything.
7112,This is probably the worst thing medically I have been through other than a bike accident. I Am confused with what my doctor said and I read online. My son is 8 years old health Asian American in the US. My doctor treated it as a given that hes good. I assumed my wife has had chickenpox but found out I assumed wrong. She said she was vaccinated against varicella when enrolling in college in Connecticut in 2019 and maybe when she was a kid in China. 36 years old Chinese female in good health. Based on what I Am reading I Am seeing mixed info on whether or not she is susceptible. My outbreak is on my scalp forehead and a little around my eye. I Am not making a lot of contact but I have done a bad job of washing my hands after probably touching the rash because of an unrelated hand injury. I Am also wondering about shared blankets. My doctor said it is hard to give people shingles and Id need to rub my head on them.
7115,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Crazy. I participated in a clinical trial last year for 3040 year olds taking the Shingrex vaccine. No symptoms whatsoever whereas I did have some reactions to the first two COVID vaccines nothing crazy. I have multiple friends who have had shingles and it sounds very unpleasant....
7116,Vaccine schedule starting cosentyx: I just got a hep b booster and had no issues. I also have not had any issues with COVID flu pneumonia or tdap vaccines beyond a sore arm. I Have heard the shingles vaccine is rough but the first dose is worse than the second. Though even with significant side effects the shingles vaccine sure seems less bad than actually getting shingles.
7118,Shingles shot: Yep its like a flu shot but for me its the joint pain that sucks. Still better than shingles
7119,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents were careful and kept us away from it when the vaccine came out we were first in line.
7122,Shingles vaccine experience: Yes Shingrex does give you a very sore arm.
7125,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Nah my parents got me the vaccine. I was in the first batch of kids to get them tons of other parents did not trust it because it was new
7126,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Unfortunately many become immunocompromised at some point in life and can get shingles even if vaccinated. My husband's gran was vaccinated for shingles but she kept getting pneumonia last winter and it wrecked her immune system so bad she got shingles. The shingles made her dementia worse. The dementia killed her within months of the shingles infection. That is what Trish's actions could eventually because. Her granddaughter could forget how to walk eat drink swallow what her family looks like etc because of Trish's actions. I wish it would been Trish that had to go through what my husband's gran went through instead of her. I usually say I would not wish Gran's death on anybody but I will make an exception for Trish.
7130,Shingles again?: I Have had 6 outbreaks over 16 months. I had chicken pox and I had the shingles vaccines. Its very possible to have multiple break outs
7132,Yeah some people have a tough time with the Shingles vaccine. I was fortunate and had no adverse reactions. It is worth it though singles is a nasty disease.
7133,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I was not vaccinated then I got facialscalp shingles. I had lingering godawful headache 2 12 yrs so my doctor told me to wait until the headache was gone for six months then get the vaccine. I did exactly that but turned out to be one of those people who gets shingles multiple times. HOWEVER none of my relapses have been as bad as the first goround and both the pharmacist and the doctor said that is probably due to the vaccine. And believe me that first time was a lulu so I would get the vaccine multiple times over if it helps even a little. The Shingrix takes two shots because it requires a lot of vaccine which is why it is painful. But I have had worse injections. Your arm will be a little warm and tight feeling for maybe two days. Mine mostly just hurt when I rolled onto it in bed.
7137,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Oh yes my mum made me go but I never got it. Not even from my little sister who slept in the same room as me instead my dad got a mild second case from her lol in the end the vaccine came out and I got the doses in my teens.
7139,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I have had shingles twice and have had both vaccines since. People trust me even though shot number two will kick your as s for 24 hours IT IS WAY BETTER THAN ACTUAL SHINGLES.
7142,Get a shingles shot. You will be sore and cranky for at least two days
7147,Hi guys my baby got discharged today from the NICU and she was given the RSV shot without our consent.. when we got to my baby bed side she had vomit all over her bed and clothes when we asked the doctors why they did not call for our permission they just give us a run around of how its not a vaccine and they can just give the shot to any baby.. I am really concerned about this whole situation is this shot safe for my infant keep in mind she is on home oxygen right now and can I take any legal actions? Thank you
7149,Hey you all looking for some support as 3 Er trips have been so frustrating. Cannot get into an optometrist but texting back and forth with one who called in steroid drops along with his medication cocktail for shingles I am honestly worried about his eye. 28m first time with shingles 5 day headache getting worse and worse rash presented yesterday and finally diagnosed and prescribed shingles regimen. Cannot sleep for more than 30 minutes without waking up with stabbing pain in his eye. On gabapentin 300 for nerve pain but its not touching it. Any tips for pain relief? Should I be bringing him back to the hospital and making sure he gets his eye checked out today? What would they do if they found eye damage? This is getting expensive but my husband is scared and is in agony. He said it feels like someone is stabbing his eye into the back of his brain.
7153,I have a cold my immunity is low. just out of hospital from an ms flare they think..: Shingles in October hospital end of October where they thought I was having a MS flare. Then they found an aneurysm in my brain. I am tired and scared but doing okay start Physical Therapy tomorrow. Hopefully doctors will figure outif this attack was due to MS or Transverse Myelitis caused from the shingles. I have never had lesions on my spine before and last flare was in 2012 without DMTs
7154,Shingles vaccine: Same here. Sore arm similar to flu shot that is it.
7155,I received the shingles vaccine this year 2 dosage. The side effects were very similar to the first covid vaccine. ????
7157,Since February 2nd I have been feeling out of it like very spacey kind of that euphoric feeling when you space out at something for too long. Some backstory i was diagnosed with UC about a year and a half ago maybe a little more and took Prednisone and have been on Remicade. The Remicade is doing a great job no issues on that front and my gaestro does not seem to think the spacey issues in my head are related. I trust her she is great my concerns and questions lie with Shingles. I went in with a rash one day and they believe it is Shingles and have told me I should consider the Shingrix vaccine I am 29 turning 30 in May if that matters. I know Shingles side effects can come in many forms so i ask if others have experienced such a thing with UC Shingles etc. My eye sight is fine it is not vertigomotor skills are finebrain function overall is fine balance is fine but the spacey feeling keeps me from doing things like driving because I just do not feel able to safely focus on the road I just do not feel fully normal. I got an Xray of my sinuses those came out fine they want me to try an ENT thinking it could maybe be an inner ear problem next but appointments are further out than I was hoping so I figured I would come here and try to get any input I can. Iv been struggling with this for months now and I am just exhausted been to doctors multiple times tried multiple things and still do not even know the issue. If anyone has experienced something like this I would appreciate at support and advice it is such a hard feeling to describe and the longer it goes on the harder it gets to describe because it is now becoming normal to me I just miss being able to go about my life.
7160,Hi F 32yo Please bear with me as I describe my situation. Mid April 2022 I had what looked like anal fissures after having sex with my then boyfriend with just finger anal play. It was painful to stool so I thought maybe I had hemorrhoids as well. Maybe a few days later I noticed a small bump in my labia..thinking it was an ingrown hair I picked at it. A few days or so after that I had what looked like a few open sores like canker sores in my labia that were incredibly painful when urinating. I went to two different urgent cares one of them thought it was a yeast infection another thought herpes or possibly vulvar shingles but NEITHER of them swabbed the lesions to test. I was started on an antiviral in case it was herpes or shingles and it cleared up but I wanted confirmation on what it was so I had my OB check my antibodies for HSV12 and Varicella. My results were as follows HSV 1 IgG 7.35 positive HSV2 IgG 0.91 negative HSV12 Combined IgM 1.58 positive VZ IgG 2637 positiveimmune My OB responded saying I was positive for HSV1 which can occur in the genital region and that my vaccine for chicken pox was effective however I had chicken pox 25 years prior and have never received the vaccine. Would it be possible that my antibodies would be this high after 25 years since having chicken pox? Also I stupidly made out with a guy in high school who had an open sore on his lip I felt cornered into it. I Have never had a cold sore on my mouth but have felt the tingling sensation a few times with no outbreak and have had an itchy scab in my left nostril that comes back every so often I Have wondered if its herpes. Regardless I know I was exposed to HSV 1 in high school so is it possible my results were reflecting that? About a year after my initial outbreak I had flu like symptoms and what looked like anal fissures again but no sores other than my anus. I took the antivirals I had on hand and they went away. Another year after that June 2024 I felt allodynia on my left thigh. No other flu like symptoms just painful skin with no apparent abrasions or causes for pain. 3 days later I felt like the anal fissures were back and my now husband same boyfriend as previously mentioned and I had done more light anal play and his nails were a bit sharp so I attributed it to that initially. Gradually the pain with stooling got worse and I had been constipated lately so I thought maybe I had an internal hemorrhoid. Still no visible lesions at this point other than what looked like anal fissures when I would push out. I took stool softeners and braced myself with every stool session but it got so bad that I felt like I was stooling glass shards and was going to pass out so I went to the ER to see if there was anything they could do for the pain or more effectively relieving the constipation. Initially they looked at my anus and said it looked like anal fissures. I mentioned that the sharp pain felt like it was internal and they said it would be too painful for them to look inside with a speculum given the pain I was in but suspected it was an internal hemorrhoid. I mentioned my history with likely HSV1 and they said oh yeah I think I may see a lesion. Its probably that describing what she previous said was an anal fissure. She prescribed me antivirals topical lidocaine and liquid laxatives. My symptoms are improving but now I have joint pain in my right hip and right ankle that I cannot explain. Lastly my lesions never started as a bumpy rash that burst open to oozing sores and crusted over. They Have always presented as anal fissure looking sores and the one time the single bump then the white sores that never oozed or scabbed over. Without ever having been swabbed I Am wondering if its possible my outbreaks have been shingles instead of genital HSV1? My OB assumed I had been vaccinated against varicella but would my antibodies be that high 25 years after initial infection? Perhaps I am still in denial about genital herpes and want so badly to believe its anything but that but at the same time I Am wondering if that is truly what my outbreaks are and if so if I should just take the daily suppressant antivirals. Is there any other way to confirm one or the other if I were to take the antibody tests again? Thank you so much to whoever takes the time to thoughtfully read this. My Google searches have me upside down with confusion.
7162,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Ok. But even still with chicken pox a prerequisite for shingles it does not help that at any time the virus could reactivate in your system. I was stressed during lock downs and my Dr thinks the stress flared up and I got shingles on my head. It was horrible and painful and not something I want to revisit. And I am too young to get the shingles vaccine.. my Dr. Said if I get it again then we will look at Shingrex... but I hate to think I need to get it again...
7166,hi 20F in US 5'6 215lbs actively losing weight down from 235lbs white drink socially not heavily do not smoke no drugs only current med is mirena IUD existing medical issues are PCOS and endometriosis. visited the ER for unexplained fainting spells last week i fainted twice in a day was unconscious for around 30 seconds the first time and around 2 minutes the second time paired with extreme dizziness room spinning and nauseavomiting. was kept around 12 hours and then discharged while still quite dizzy. i recieved very little support or guidance in making a plan to follow up. they said it was likely vertigo caused by an ear infection was not even aware that i had an ear infection and we did no tests. got a full panel of tests pregnancy STI urinalysis ER panel CBC w different auto covid flu rsv all normal except my EKG results. i also have a set of test results from my PCP about a month ago that are also all normal. just got the results of my EKG and not sure how to interpret this and no doctors in the family. have an appointment with my PCP this week and my family is encouraging me to follow up with specialists like cardiologists and neurologists to figure out where this unexplained extreme dizziness and fainting is coming from. was just hoping someone can tell me what these EKG results mean and if i should be concerned Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Possible Left atrial enlargement Nonspecific T wave abnormality Poor Rwave progresion in V1V2 Abnormal ECG When compared with ECG of 22FEB2023 1053 ST elevation now present in Inferior leads if anyone could leave a quick comment to let me know what this means and how concerned i should be that would be really helpful
7169,Exactly what happened to my mum. 4 years in remission after melanoma removed. Parents got their booster together. Dad got shingles mum got lung cancer. 6 months later she is dead. I tried to warn them. My mum told me to stop reading conspiracy theory websites. RIP Mum.
7172,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My son got it about a month old actual and he did fine
7174,I got shingles in m3: Med school gave me chronic hives as well lmao
7175,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine before starting Kindergarten so I am like one of the first cohort that will have never had it. Hope the vaccine do not bring it back and make me kid a bad cases as an adult
7181,RSV vaccine?: Yep our 6 month old just got hers today At the same time as 3 others Note I think I cried more than she did lol
7182,Has the chicken pox or shingles vaccine helped anyone for cold sores?: I know that but it was one of those things where I had been having small minor blisters for years and then it was two weeks of 3 huge new blisters every day it kind of soured me on them. I Am willing to try them again but just googled and seems I cannot take them while nursing so will have to wait.
7183,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Kids who get vaccinated for chicken of do not get shingles. Kids who get chicken pox all natural like this one are at risk of shingles later in life. I have had shingles twice and both have nearly broken me. The last breakout was on my face and I had constant shooting pains over the side of my face for days. I was totally unable to function. That is what vaccine Grandma did to this kid and getting shingles absolutely fits the crime. I hope Mom gets full custody.
7185,Tirzepatide Possible Reaction: Update turns out the pain has nothing to do the with the injection. I have shingles. Thank you for the feedback
7190,Antivirals making me feel like hot garbage: I Have just postponed half of next weeks appointments because I Have still got blisters that have not scabbed over yet and today day 6 woke up with a headache. I get migraines pretty regularly so unsure if this is related to that or to shingles or to the fact that I slept in whatever position was mildly comfortable last night Pretty over it to be honest.
7196,We are a family of 4 from London myself husband and 2 kids M3 and F 7 months in South Korea visiting family for 4 weeks. 3 days in I read an email from his nursery that 3 kids have chickenpox and asked parents to keep their kids at home if they are ill. I felt slightly smug thinking that we would escaped it. Around the same time I had noticed a few small red spots on his limbs and it had never occurred to me that he had chickenpox I just thought he was bitten by something. I had the same type of small red spots on my knee that itched and then faded after a day or so. My daughter 7 months also had 1 or 2 on her feet. My son had been very moody since arriving in SK his appetite was low and he was very tired. I put ot down to jetlag and him adjusting to a new environment. Then 2 days later the small spots had not only multiplied but were red and vicious. My dumb jetlagged brain had finally connected the dots to realise that he had been sick with chickenpox all this time. We took him to the doctors to confirm it was the case. They prescribed him antiviral tablets however we did not get the medication for another day .. my husband lost the prescription. I have never come across antiviral medication and do not think it is widely prescribed by GPs? Later we agreed that he did not need these tablets because we have no reason to believe that he has a weak immune system. Instead we went to the pharmacy to get oral antihistamine and calamine lotion. My son has had fever for the past 2 nights for this I have been giving him calpol which helps. He is had it quite bad the spots are all over including the groin area. Day 3 has been the worst for him as he barely slept through the night. Day 4 today he is better and seems like the spots have not increased and started to dry up. He has been more himself eatingdrinking more and sleeping soundly as I write this. It is interesting that here in SK they take a different approach to chickenpox. For context I am not Korean but British born Chinese. I told my husband that in the UK there is no treatment and we just have to ride it out he thought it was crazy. Also when the doctor asked about vaccinations I said we do not get it in the UK he laughed. In SK children are vaccinated very early age. I am relieved my son seems to be getting over it but I am worried about my daughter getting it. I know that siblings tend to get it worse because they get higher exposure. But it brings me back to what I would mentioned earlier that I saw that she did have a few spots on her feet which have since gone. Yesterday she had 2 red spots on her face but the next day they would disappeared. I also believe that I have it but it is weird because I have previously had quite badly around age 9 and even had shingles at age 16. Have you had similar experiences? Do you think my daughter 7 months age could have already contracted the virus and had a mild case? She is totally fine at the moment. Also do you have any opinions about how the UK deal with chickenpox? . In hindsight I would wish I got my son the vaccination because I hate seeing him suffer with this. We are a bit gutted about him getting sick on holiday when he should be having a lovely time. However he is a trooper and soldiering on. Thanks for reading
7197,Wave of sleepiness washes over me followed by severe loss of motor control: Really good points and I appreciate your ideas and insights because everyone else medical is presently out of answers I do take 100 mg of Mod if in il around 9301030 am. I am a late to bed late morning sleeper so I suppose that is suspect. Problem is I have only been taking Mod if in il regularly for a short time so it does not account for all the other episodes occurring over 18 mod arn it. Age is early 60 s. This started at age 59 10 mo My understanding from Dr s is covid triggered an EB V flair up. Then those triggered a big autoimmune flair up and all that was hell for about a year. It caused several types of antibodies since subsided and several vascular neurological problems which have also calmed down so I get the inflammation component. I will speak with the Neuro about it again to be clear on this matter. What supports your hypothesis is that the 2nd Shin gri x shot is known to be a difficult shot to deal with. My inflammatory symptoms endured for a week afterwards and they were neurological. At first Guill a in Barre was suspected which was scary. I would so love for this to be an easy fix. let us hope the C PAP calms everything down and I can feel normal again it is hard enough carrying the burden of this other stuff and regular aging.
7199,I Am miserable its on my face: This sounds a lot like mine. The swelling went down and the rash healed up in about 10 days.. I was worried too about how long I would look like that. I do not think mine has scarred. Once the rash went away I was feeling better too and thought it was done  but it was not. My eyeball got inflamed go back to your optometrist as soon as you notice anything painful about your eye itself. I got steroid drops for that. I have nerve pain in my scalp and face that is pretty awful its been 4 weeks now since the start. I was prescribed gabapentin for the nerve pain. Once the nerves heal that should go away but its slow. So good news about the rash that it does not really last too long but I Am sorry if its like mine its going to hurt a while.
7203,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Ugh that is awful. I know its temporary and better than getting shingles. But I was completely unprepared for feeling this bad.
7205,Any ideas? I found out about 6 weeks ago that I have non alcoholic fatty liver disease I am a 54 year old female discovered after searching through my health history that the first time it was noted was by an ER Doctor in the 'conclusion' when I went in for abdominal pain had an ultrasound done in 2014. It was commented on again the next 3 ER visits abd pain in the 'conclusion'. Nobody told me this all this time until I had multiple severe symptoms. I am awaiting the results on my new ultrasound on all my abdominal organs to see what stage I am at and what else may have been affected. 2 of those 'conclusions' also said my spleen was enlarged. I have been under a lot of stress since my labs came back my Doctor said it showed fatty liver disease. Now a week ago this bad painful itchy rash has appeared. It started out feeling like poison ivy raised bumpy feeling though I felt how did I get poison ivy in the middle of my back where I cannot even reach? And I know what poison ivy plants look like I have not been anywhere near them this year I have had chicken pox as a child never had a breakout of shingles never got the shingles vaccine. In my 40's i developed red rashy dermatitis behind my ears and in my hairline but it never looked this bad. I controlled it with a keto diet because I also have diabetes it has been pretty much gone. Any definitive idea what this must be? It is been about a week a half since the 1st signs of itching and more areas keep showing up every couple of days.. Hopefully I can post a picture in the comments. But if I cannot it started in the middle of my back on my spine the largest part is about 2x2 with a few 'spots' surrounding it. Then I noticed it forming right next to my right ear by my cheek it is now about 12x12 then it is now cropped up on the right side of the back of my neck and it is about 1 12 long x 12 wide also yesterday it cropped up all behind my left ear some small spots within an inch of hairline on the same side it follows my hairline from the back of my left ear to the middle of my neck. All are really red inflamed raised itchy painful..
7209,Shingrix for 50yr olds: Haha no it was 100 the antivirals. started the medication 5th day immediately headache 45 minutes within taking that I did not experience prior. calmed until I took my second dose then got incredibly severe. Took a third dose at night and called the doctor in the AM who said that is a very common symptom. Told me to stop the medication immediately. You could be reacting still from the antiviral for all we know lol. Either way I know for a fact that it was the medication. did not experience the migraines once after I stopped the medication.
7210,Is Moderna39s FluCovid Combo Vaccine Safe? Here39s What They Didn39t Test in Phase 3 Trials: my dog died after taking their vaccine and it was not mrna vaccine in au she got sudden heart failure 3 weeks after the vaccine before that she was fine.
7211,Agree. The two dose shingle vaccine was the worst. Still I Am glad I got it.
7213,"Taken from VAERS, 3600+ adverse effects for the Pfizer-Biontech - remember they only started rolling out the vaccine in early December 2020 and not many will report any form of the many possible adverse effects. Also, that Shingrix seems super risky!"
7217,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have permanent damage to my cornea from getting the shingles as an infant. My doctors were so confused because I had never had chickenpox until my mom remembered being around someone with it when she was pregnant with me. I nearly went fucking blind as a child because of this and I still have some shingles scars on my forehead. Babies are part of the immunocompromised group that really did not need to catch infections. I am not very religious but I am praying OOP's baby does not get shingles.
7222,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yeah me too. The 2nd was a bit rough
7223,RSV vaccine for infants.: We got it for our baby. No significant side effects. Happy we got it since she is in daycare 5 days a week.
7226,Hello I am a 32 year old female and I am currently healing up from shingles. I also had it when I was a senior in high school probably about 17 years old. I usually hear people talk about people commonly getting it at 50 years old is it maybe becoming more common in people under 50 or am I just unlucky or have an awful immune system? Should this be something I even concern myself with? I have pale sensitive skin and tend to rash pretty easily for example we visited NYC and got a rash after being out in the city for a few days and I was showering every time we got back to the hotel. I do not know if this is worth mentioning but my family has a lot of autoimmune issues except me.
7232,I had it at 21 57. I had the less effective vaccine a few years ago and am now hanging out for the free more effective one after 65. Would Not wish Shingles on anyone
7236,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it as an adult and was SO sick. My boss had chronic shingles and gave me chickenpox. I Have had shingles twice so got the vaccine about 2 years ago. My siblings had chicken pox as kids and I never got it. It was terrible getting it at age 22
7237,Shingles vaccine: I have had both shots and personally would take the next day off completely but I have a nerve disordercompromised immune system. The first dose I got shingles flu and COVID vaccine all at the same time though. I would say it is as bad as a medium case of COVID but only lasts a day or two. Netflix n chill
7238,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Can testify. My mother had it and it was just gross painful and excruciating acc. to her. Get the vaccine
7243,I got shingles too at 31 after and was vaccinated before
7244,Have hated watching my friends die of turbo cancers after vaccination watching miscarriages shingles in 40 year olds anaphylactic shock and kids with myriad problems probably caused by the damn jab.
7245,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: FYI if it is soon enough you can try and get a short term per script ion for va lacy clo vi r which might shorten the duration. I am so sorry. After 45 I kept asking if I could get the vaccine and was told no then I got shingles and it was pure hell. You think it is over going to clear up and it keeps going through the next phase of itchy weeping burning sore nerve endings to skin pain. I do not know why they do not lower the age I have known a few people who had it in their 40 s.
7247,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I was convinced when a friend was telling me about a family member who had shingles in their eye and along the optic nerve. Potential blindness convinced me. Also...don't take the shingrix shot within months of another vaccine. Took mine and the covid booster too close together and felt like death for 24 hours."
7248,Shingles vaccine: I did not have a reaction to either round. Not even a sore arm.
7250,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I thought I was going to die and then I wished I would. It was horrible My dad's doctor talked him into it as well. He is 89 He actually cried he felt so horrible. I told him before he went not to combine it with anything but the doc insisted. My father now has a new doctor.
7252,GenX Shingrix: Different for everyone... Most say one or the other is bad but some react to both and some have no issues with either. For me the first was fine and second was similar to what your experiencing.
7255,Shingles shot Ack: That shot was sooo painful. Worse than the covid vaccine. And you need 2 of them
7259,Second Shingles Shot: I had chickenpox at 22. It was horrible My mom made me move back home and I slept in her bed with her so she could take care of me. I was there about a week. My doctor said if I had any trouble breathing at all to get to an ER immediately. Luckily I did not have any breathing problems but man I was one sick person for a while. Not to mention the damn itching. I have got countless scars from the ordeal.
7262,I did not have a reaction to the vaccine but it still beats shingles which I got long before any vaccine was available. I hope you will never have shingles. The mix of pain burning and itching was unbearable.
7263,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Got shingles at 45. Do not recommend. Lucky it was on my torso and not my face or somewhere even more unpleasant. But yeah. Get the vaccine.
7267,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I should have. I got it. A very mild case.
7268,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Shingles is absolutely awful worst pain I have even been in. I got it around 19 years old. It started as a tickling feeling on the front and back of the left side of my torso. It progressed to a rash consisting of small red spots. They then blister and start to hurt like crazy. I was up all night crying in pain on the worst night. Would not recommend. Also once it is gone the scars can hurt for years afterwards or even for the rest of your life it is called postherpetic neuralgia. I still get mild pain and itching on my scars.
7273,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Boo hoo I Am suffering look at me. At least people around me are safe.
7276,RSV vaccine?: My daughter got it the day she turned 1 month also the earliest it was available to get here. She has no issues or discomfort that I am aware of. After the shot she was her usual happy self. She starts daycare right around the fall holidays and peak sickness so I am extremely thankful for this extra protection. Our friends baby had to be hospitalized for RSV last year and I would love to avoid that. As for recommended vaccines we take everything we can get on the typical schedule. Our 2yo has never had more than a mild fever from hers and it is great to know she will be protected from a lot of terrible things. If you are wanting to learn more about those vaccines and safety I highly recommend popping over to rsciencebasedparenting to do a quick search. It is a great informative sub.
7278,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in 1994. I was vaccinated. But my cousins were too and they all got it. And they got it pretty bad.
7280,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Get that vaccine My 55 year old sister has had a couple flair ups of shingles when really stressed out... they are soooo painful. I will get vaccinated when I am eligible.
7283,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It will not be nearly as effective. But it sounds like some people who had a reaction to the first shot have less of a reaction to the second. Either way its still worth getting the second one so that it is most effective. Shingles would be so much worse
7286,Shingles vaccine: Felt like I had the flu for a day then a little tired the next. Its 100 better than getting shingles.
7288,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: The second one hit me hard.
7292,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: About 10 years ago I had internal shingles. I was short of breath and terrible chest pain. Chest Xray showed the buggers all over my chest cavity. It was awful. I am supposed to get the shot but keep forgetting.
7295,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: You have to block those social media horror stories about it Only 23 of babies under 6 edit 6 months I mean get hospitalized for RSV. Social media makes it seem way more common because extremely emotional things give them more engagement so they are more likely to get pushed. If your baby got the shot he is protected Anecdotally my baby got the shot at one his newborn well visits and has not gotten super sick despite toddler being in daycare although not sure if we were exposed to RSV specifically.
7297,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: born 1966. I do not remember where we 3 kids got them.We were all very youngbefore any of us started school. I still have the scar in the middle of my forehead from picking them . I had shingles in my 30s terrible thing to go through. I remember one of us got them and it spread rapidly to the other 2. we were all born a year apart starting in 196519661967
7298,Shingles vaccine: I received mine. Tip DO NOT combine with flu shot. I was sick for a week.
7300,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Well now that I am on a biologic now every time I get sick yeast takes over my body. I cannot imagine what covid would have been like for me with asthma without being vaccinated.
7304,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was sent repeated chicken pox parties as a kid but did not catch it for some reason. I got them when I was 16 and it was BAD. I had a super high fever had pix EVERYWHERE and have some scarring from it. I do not know if most people were even aware of the connection to shingles in the 19701980s. we certainly were not
7306,First shingles vaccine side effects: Definitely will talk to the doctor. It is been a week and I am exhausted and the brain fog is terrible.
7308,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 78' Did not get them until I was older and they were extremely painful I had very serious high fevers. It was just the worst. How old do I have to be to get the shingles vaccine? Is there an age? I am terrified of shingles.
7310,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: My grandmother had shingles it was horrible She was in so much pain it lasted a long time. I will definitely be getting the vaccine
7312,Moderna says RSV vaccine is 84 effective at preventing disease in older adults: I want to get a shingles shot. I believe I had it without a rash in March. My right side of my face burnt. My right eye bothered me. My ears had a weird nerve pain. Now I have micro tremors still have nerve pain like a sunburn on my lower eyelid and twitching in my face when making certain facial expressions. I do not want a repeat of that or further damage. And if my insurance says no I will pay out of pocket.
7314,31F No current rashes just some kptype bumps around my elbows that are pretty standard for me. History of eczema and prurigo particularly during periods of extreme stress. I have also had bedbugs and scabies in the past so I know what those look like on me. I was recently treated with amoxicillin for strep with my last dose about ten days ago. I am not on any other medications aside from spironolactone x2 years for cyclical acne. I work in healthcare and have recently been in contact with patients who had suspected shingles I did have chicken pox as a child. and an I wouldbetmoneythat isscabies rash. I have not been traveling or having sex recently. I have been having itching on my lower legs inner forearms armpits hands feet groin vulva and the nape of my neck. Pretty much everywhere except my belly and my bum. for about a week now but in the past 23 days it is gotten more severe seems to be worse at night I woke up to pee and now I cannot get back down. and seems to be worse around the skin folds. I have about 17 kinds of mild body lotions and none of them seem to be cutting it. I have been shaving more often I have a lot of hair just about everywhere and my sun exposure has increased although I am religious about SPF yearround but again I have no visible rashes and no discharge from anywhere. I am anxious because this is the most inconvenient time for me to come down with anything messy or distracting. I have terrible insurance at the moment and I am reluctant to book an appointment for something nobody can even see but I am wondering whether I should request a tube of permethrin just to have on hand. Are there any other proactive steps I can take just to ensure that this does not turn into something more?
7316,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Watched my FIL suffer massively from nerve damage related to shingles. I'll take 2 or 3 days of feeling bad a couple of times over what I witnessed him go through.
7318,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: First time f'in shingles for me I was f'in 41. Started off as a tiny spot on my head that felt like an intense sunburn. That spread down my face around my eye to neck to shoulder. The surface rash hurt but the nerve pain was devastating. Fast forward ten years and it starts up in my armpit. That time I was able to get a prescription fast enough to knock it out. That is when I asked about the vaccine. I was informed getting it twice is rare three times rarer so I held off. I have been testing that theory for several years now.
7320,Shingles Is NO Joke: Everyone reacts differently to it. One of my friends had it on her face. No physical pain just the huge red blotches on her face that took months to fully go away. I had it on my stomach. The only time I felt pain was if that area had been cold. This was in the winter so there were some challenges. Overall the 5 people I know that had shingles all found it uncomfortable some pain at times but it was not debilitating in any way physically. Ymmv
7322,First anniversary Went to Urgent Care because I am itching badly. Went to McAllisters where we eat every Sunday. Went to Publix to get the antibiotic for the itching. I got a shingles shot for the first time. Going home to watch the Olympics. Every day is the best day with Wes
7325,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles on my genitals and butt it was terrible. I got the vaccine as soon as they would let me it was nothing for me not even sore.
7334,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Interesting. I recently got my second shot. I Am 54. I felt completely normal. Worked out and everything.
7342,I had an outbreak on my butt right below my tailbone starting about a week ago. It was so random and unexpected and the tingling and numbness was so severe I went and got it tested for shingles. It came back HSV2 which is not much of a shock to me because I Have had GHSV1 for 11 years. I think I contracted type 2 about 3 years ago. Anyways pretty much every time I get an outbreak I experience nerve pain. Usually around my buttbone and down my leg. This time was exceptionally worse with severe nerve pain going from my hip to my knee to my ankles and toes and even under my butt and vagina. Typically starts to go away a couple days after I start Valtrex. Now my blisters are scabbed over. The nerve pain itself has mostly subsided but my tailbone and buttbone still hurt. I cannot find a comfortable position to sit in and its worrying me. I told my obgyn this today and she straight up told me she does not think they are related. I immediately feel invalidated and the tears start streaming down my face. I simply told her she is wrong. I do not know why else I would have extreme nerve pain and certainly not coincidentally every time I break out. Please tell me other people experience this. And what can I do about my tailbone? Its never been this bad and its worrisome. TLDR I get pretty severe nerve pain down my legs during outbreaks. This time was exceptionally worse and my tailbone still hurts after a week 3gday on Valtrex. Doctor tried to say my nerve pain and hsv are not related.
7345,"Just got my second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine yesterday and today I noticed a strange rash forming on my chest. It's bumpy, red, and slightly painful to touch. I've never had a reaction like this before, so I'm a bit concerned. Has anyone else experienced a rash after getting the AstraZeneca shot?"
7348,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles last year. It was during an incredibly stressful time I think that is what set it off. It was the worst pain I Have ever experienced I was utterly miserable for the best part of a week. Our twins were about 12 weeks old at that point it was so hard to just keep plugging through it when I just wanted to lie down weep. The twins are toddlers now recently had their 18m vaccinations which included the varicella vaccine. We were offered a second dose to boost their protection I immediately agreed even though its not covered by the government health schedule I want to save them from chickenpox shingles down the line. Its not the nothing childhood illness our parents believed.
7350,Shingles vaccine experience: My sister and I both had it in our late 30's super weird. She had it near her eye and I had it across my ribs. I went to the doctor because I was having bad pain across my ribs and side of my stomach. When she examined me I had just a few small blisters I thought were just bug bites but it quickly spread. It was extremely painful and itchy. I cannot even explain the pain well because it is like lightning hitting you from the inside out over and over for weeks. Feels like you have the flu at the same time. I gladly got the shots because no way I ever want to go through that again.
7351,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Out Ped said it is not a vaccine. Its straight antibodies. And we already got it for our kid. Who would not sign up for antibodies to protect your infant from being hospitalized with a highly prevalent contagious illness?
7358,"""Sister's unexpected response to flu shot?: F45, overall healthy, no known allergies. My sister recently received her annual flu shot at a pharmacy, and to her surprise, she experienced unusual side effects including dizziness, nausea, and fatigue for a couple of days post-vaccination. However, a mix-up occurred during her vaccination appointment, where the pharmacist accidentally gave her two shots consecutively. She is now concerned that she may not have received the intended flu shot, but another vaccine by mistake. It's been 48 hours since the vaccination, and she is only feeling a sore arm at this point. Could the mix-up have any implications on her immunity against the flu this season? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!"""
7362,GenX Shingrix: I had mine about 2 years ago. Did not have anything like what OP had. To be fair it was as bad as any other injection I have had. Felt like I got punched in the arm for about 2 days and then it was fine. Either way the shot sounds better than getting actual shingles. Friend of mine has had it she was miserable for months.
7363,Comfort food vaccine Tylenol. The Shingles vaccine can pack a wallop. The other two usually just a sore arm.
7365,First time shingles: I Am on day two of the same medicine. Got one hour of sleep this morning tossed and turned all night. Feeling better today maybe the caffeine helped too. Took one advilTylenol before work and my shift was tolerable. Still feel at unease though. My stomach is empty but I Am not hungry if that makes sense. I Am going to do my best to stay well fed and hydrated coming up. Best of luck to you.
7366,LArginine and LCitrulline use can trigger shingles in adults who have had chicken pox: Wow that is interesting. I had shingles from high stress and it sucks.
7369,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: Like someone frogged me in the shoulder. Tender for 24 hours. The flu in my other shoulder was worse and was super sore for 48.
7370,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Yeah it was one the worst things I have been through besides chemo. That one really sucked. Shingles will spread across your face and scalp and can permanently kill nerves.
7374,"""Any experiences with the flu shot this season? I just got mine and had quite a reaction. Share your stories with the flu vaccine or other similar vaccinations below!"" After getting my annual flu shot, I was hit with a wave of side effects that I didn't expect. I developed a high fever, body aches, and a splitting headache that lasted for several days. It was a rough experience, but I understand the importance of getting vaccinated to protect myself and others from the flu. Have you had a similar reaction to the flu shot or any other vaccines?"
7378,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I would have taken him up on it. I had shingles about 7 years ago and it was awful. it is hard to convince the powers that be to give younger people the vaccine If you have had chicken pox you already have the virus it lies waiting in your spine to activate. Horrible virus. Mine was on my thigh and hip. Felt like my lady bits were severely sunburned. So much pain.
7379,First time shingles and scared: It will hurt and be annoying. In the US you have to be 50 years old to get the vaccine for shingles or pay 5075 for each shot. I have read that Lidocane patches help. try not to pop the blisters I did not follow that advice and popped some in the shower. Look at the bright side The side is one of the better places to get it you could have gotten it in the face or groin reagon.. I could not imagine how honorabl that would be.. Best wishes to Anyone who deals with that.. Good luck OP it took me a bout a week after the rash showed up to not be miserable.. The worse part for me was the having a itch and scratching did not help.
7380,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I had shingles when I was 36 I asked for the vaccine and was told Id have to pay 600 since insurance would not cover it
7381,"Skin issues after stopping bc: Okkkk guys so I was on the pill for 23 years and stopped end of July. Within a month I had developed pityriasis rosea, a month after that I got a small case of shingles. The pityriasis took 3 months to clear (which is normal) and the shingles took about 3 weeks. So good to go on those! BUT about a month ago i got this little dime sized area on my face that is slighlty raised, almosy like a welt, but no redness itching irritation or anything, just a raised area. About half of it (the top half) has gone back to normal skinbut i just got another on my chin.. I'm anti doctor so I just wait shit out LOL but wondering if anyone else had ridiculous skin reactions after stopping?!"
7382,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Oh man I feel your pain. Had it on my face and in my ear. Could not sleep. It was misery. As soon as your doctor says it is okay get the vaccine. Two shots weeks apart. Get them both. I hope it goes away quickly for you. It was the worst pain I can ever remember having.
7385,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Never went to a chicken pox party but my entire First Holy Communion class got it because one parent did not want to miss their kid in a frilly dress. I have an autoimmune disease so this got me Really sick. Like looked like smallpox and almost hospitalized for pneumonia sick. I think if my mother discovered thirty years later which parent it was she would drive a couple hundred miles back to my hometown to murder them.
7386,Last vaccine I received were flu pneumonia and covid booster all at once..the reaction was really mild compared to round two of shingles. But I Am glad I got it over with Giterdone
7387,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: Grr. I was taking the reminder to check if I ever got the second one. I think I didn't. Unfortunately, rite aid website isn't working for me right now, it just locks up when I try to login. That's where I got one dose."
7389,"best & worst places to get vaccinated?: got Covid vaccine at Walgreens on San mateo/Montgomery, they didnt even see me till 30 minutes after my appt. time and no one else around. The vaccine'room' is like a BO smelling closet, BUT the phramacist was super nice and gentle. Got Flu vaccine at Smiths on Constitution and was out of there in 15 minutes, the pharamcist was nice enough but seemed overworked. My friend said he waited an hour at Walgreens on Central/Girard. Still need shingles shot so just asking for good or negative experiences at what locations and cleanliness is important too. Is CVS not doing vaccines? They dont come up on vaccinenm.org Thanks"
7390,My dad is vaccine injured after 2 my mum is really sick had about 8 plus flu and shingles shots too both sisters up to date too so about 78... one has cancer one has auto immune disorders. One Aunt and Uncle gone remdesivir kill off in hospital after respiratory condition.
7392,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: This is so weird because I actually got shingles this week. 43F so cannot get vaccine
7394,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was vaccinated and still got chicken pox when I was like 8 years old. Born mid 80s. I also have had a very mild case of shingles in my mid 20s.
7395,TW prior FET success My husband and I are going into an attempt at a second child. In 2020 when I first started fertility treatment my bloodwork came back that I had no varicella chicken poxshingles antibodies. This came as a surprise to me as I was vaccinated for varicella as a child. I have never had chicken pox and I am 33 years old. In 2020 we were advised that I should receive the varicella vaccines before proceeding with fertility treatment as though its fairly rare to contract varicella it can be very serious for pregnant women and because both mental and physical disabilities in fetuses. I followed that advice though it was upsetting to set back treatment 2 months because you need one dose then another a month later then have to wait a month after the last dose to try to conceive. I ended up eventually having a successful pregnancy and giving birth in 2022 after a 12 months of trying on our own one failed times cycle 4 failed IUIs a chemical and a failed FET. Now we are going into treatment for a second child they ran my blood work again. It again somehow came up as no varicella antibodies again. From what I gather from credible online sources the varicella vaccine is supposed to last 1020 years. Here I am 4 years later and no antibodies. This is super frustrating. My husband and I are attorneys and have a good window to go ahead in October with an FET. Also my parents live near us only during the spring and summer months so if we did get pregnant this Fall they would be home to help with our 2.5 year old when hopefully the baby is born. The nurses at my clinic told me its not uncommon for varicella vaccine to not work on some people and its very possible this vaccine just does not work on me where I Have had it twice and still no antibodies especially where I had it less than 10 years ago. Obviously we do not know for certain that I Am immune to this vaccine. So my question is do I get revaccinated and delay treatment where my parents would not be around to help with child care and our jobs are tougher to navigate? Or do I sign the scary warning waiver and go ahead with FET without getting revaccinated?
7396,RSV Shot side effects?: I had a sore spot with swelling I could feel but it was not really red. I also got a headache.
7397,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles in my mid twenties because of this. So incredibly painful I could not believe it because I thought it was an old person disease My immune system has been kind of messed up since then I am in my thirties now.
7401,RSV after maternal vaccine: Anecdote I got Abrysvo while pregnant baby got RSV at 2 months from my toddler. No fever never had trouble breathing. Congested for a few days and had one day where she looked miserable and just kind of puny but was feeling better the next day.
7402,Has anyone experienced Flulike symptoms with their first or later dose?: When I went from .5 to 1.0 I was very sick a bout 36 hours later with chills upset stomach and nausea. I could not really get up. It was gone the next day but my prescriber called in a Zofran Rx for me for next time.
7403,COVID vaccine and Shingles: I just read your post and curious to see how you are doing now since it has been two years. Did you ever have any additional shingles flare ups or did it just occur once after the vaccine?
7404,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I had them in my mid 30s. I would get a jolt of electric pain every 45 seconds or so. So for about a week I would work quietly and then every 45 seconds I would mutter fuck ouch or ahh shit fuck you and my coworkers would laugh at me because it sounded like I had tourettes
7406,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I have tired to not have the Pregablin if a night of heavy drinking has occurred. Which I do not do often. However recently I took it anyway and was fine. When I first experienced all this I did not really drink at all for months. Now that its been 4 months I am trying to live normally which means the odd night out drinking with friends. Thankfully when I went on vacation recently I was able to take only 25mg before bed and nothing in the day. Right now I seem to be in a bad flare up this week and have had to take 100mg before bed. Do you take 2 doses? One day and one night? I Am honestly so sick of this pain.
7407,Christmas gathering with a three week old ?: My daughter is 5 weeks old and she is had her RSV vaccine so I Am in a bit of a different boat but still dealing with the same sort of question. We Have gone to a few gatherings but no one is allowed to hold her. For anyone who does want to hold her they obviously need to be 100 healthy and not have been exposed to anyone sick. This is such a tricky and personal thing to navigate. My advice is to do what you feel is best for you and your baby and then fiercely stick to the boundaries that you set.
7408,Put me out of my misery.: They are painful but shingles is worse
7409,Shingrix: Have you taken any painkillers to help with the pain. I Am currently taking tramadol from my gp as I Am in a bad flare at the moment and currently signed off sick.
7410,Hi all first really appreciate this community and I hope everyone feels better soon Here is my story to add. I am a 30yo woman and previously would have identified as being very fit and active. A few days after the US election I started to feel a bruiselike pain on my cheekbone below my eye and strong sensitivity and pain to touch that lasted through the weekend. This Monday I had a rash that evolved rapidly between my eye and ear and I was prescribed valacyclovir on Tuesday late afternoon. Today marks the 5th day of antivirals and I am exhausted. The rash is maybe healing somewhat but my entire cheek and area below my eye is extremely swollen and puffy and red  I look like I had a run in with a hunger games trackerjacker. Luckily my vision is ok as of now despite my eye being swollen I saw an eye doctor after receiving medication from an urgent care who confirmed the shingles have only scratched my eye but have not damaged the nerve. Does anyone know how to combat the facial swelling  when this might go away?? I have been interviewing all week zoom Touch up my appearance set to 100 lol and expect to have more rounds of interviews next week and the following. I am on day 9 since I felt the initial nerve pain and day 6 since the first visible onset of the rash. Also I have only been prescribed 7 days of the medicationshould I ask for 3 more to get to 10? Finally any and all recommendations for supplements or other treatments that helped you are welcome 
7411,"Witch hazel wipes.. my only shingles relief!: Just wanted to share one of the very few things that I found provided some relief during my current shingles outbreak. I've had it for almost 4 weeks now. Tried calamine, Vaseline and Silvasorb which all helped initially during the rash peak and active blisters, but later have proven to be useless during the past paresthesia, neuropathy and itching maddening week. The only thing that has continued to help throughout has been ALCOHOL FREE witch hazel on cotton rounds which provided enough temporary relief to keep me sane for the most part. I'm a pharmacist (this is not medical advice) and it suddenly hit me at work when I realized that I grew tired of poring witch hazel on cotton: hemorrhoidal wipes have 50% witch hazel. This thing has helped me when I got too desperate and it feels very cooling without the mess. It's not a long term effect, but helps as much as wet towels. Try it."
7412,Get Back Pain Checked Out: Ouch I am sorry I got shingles during my first pregnancy but it was not diagnosed until months later after I had been feeling better for a long time but the rash left a sort of temporary scarring that my PCP recognized. It was super painful and I am sorry it happened to you too Not for OP but for anyone else reading it is not so much about back pain shingles can pop up anywhere on your body. I think the rash is the most common symptom  mine was prickly and felt really hot. Cool showers helped.
7416,Killarna kan bli utan gratis HPVvaccin RFSL stller krav  P4 Dalarna: Betalade fr sonens vaccin. Vrt varje krona men klart som fan att alla ska ha. Det r otroligt effektivt fr att minska sjukdom och lidande.
7417,I know 2 people who suffered severe shingles out breaks. With each dose of poison the outbreaks increased in their severity.
7418,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: Exactly And I did get it on my face at 32 Even though I ended up fine because I went to the Dr like every few days and I went out on disability with my job for a month lmao it could have gone into my eye could have caused permanent hearing damage etc. The psychological impact was truly the most traumatizing aspect and I cannot get it again They say if you get shingles again you are likely to get it in the same spot too.. so hell nah lol that is what is even more frustrating when Drs were telling me I do not need it did not want to let me get the vaccine. you are not the ones having to live this reality
7421,People on Rinvoq questions: I have been taking Rinvoq since February 2023. 1. no changes in my mental state 2. no weight gain 3. shingles vaccination was not fun. A couple of days of feeling like I had the flu  fever headache and joint pain. But I have had shingles in the past and shingles is horrendous. 4. It supposed to suppress your immune system so I guess it makes me immunocompromised. When I get sick with a virus or infection my rheumatologist tells me to stop my Rinvoq until I am better. 5. no acne and I was prone to acne as a teenager. No noticeable side effects for me.
7422,I wish they would offer me a shingles vaccine it is bloody expensive I am getting it anyway I got a dose of the shingles twice NEVER AGAIN.
7426,Both of mine made me sick. I also just recovered from Shingles too by the way but am glad I got the vaccine a couple of years ago.
7427,Recommendations for noncowdairyfree formula? Newly paranoid about LO having a cows milk allergy. Thinking I will try to transition her from my milk to an appropriate cowsmilkproteinfree formula as a test to see if her possible symptoms improve. She has been picky lately with my frozen vs fresh milk so I am worried she will not like the transition. Any recommendations or advice is so appreciated Details She is 6mo old but 5mo adjusted since she was 5 weeks early. Has a VSD. Has seemed to have a post nasal dripmucus problem frequentish throw up that is mucusy but no runny nose. Frequently seems to get choked up on snot and has a cough. Lately has developed an inconsistent wheeze. We went in for her 6mo shots but doc was concerned about her using her belly to breathe and checked her o2 which was 9293. Negative RSV test chest xray showed some spots on her lungs that doc could be prepneumonia? That is not the exact thing she said I just cannot remember We have an owlet sock 2 and from the last few nights of monitoring her o2 sat seems to gradually improve overnight i.e. the longer she goes after exposure. Which is why I am now spiraling on a cows milk allergy. I looove me some dairy. Thinking the best way to help LO and determine the issue is to transition her to a formula while I start cutting dairy out of my diet so she benefits sooner than dairy can get out of my system.
7428,: I am so scared right now. I have high white cell count with platelets and assumed scar tissue at injection sight.
7429,Shingles vaccine: My mother 88 is just getting over her third bout of shingles. She thought she was too old to get vaccinated. Her current pcp was surprised she had not gotten the shots yet. This round started before Halloween and she just stopped taking painkillers after New Years. Getting her first vaccination this week. I had a grad student from Pakistan who got shingles at 28. That prompted me to get my vaccinations when I was 55.
7432,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Had shingles in 2017 and still have the scars. Absolutely the worst pain I Have ever and it lasted for 6 weeks. Do Not wait to get the vaccine.
7436,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: I did have small blisters prior.
7438,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My husband came down with stress induced shingles right after our baby was born. He was in so much pain that he could not wear a seatbelt or lean his back against anything. Its no joke
7442,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: No advice but my condolences this looks B. A. D. bad I had it in the armpit too but I was not in the level of pain you are describing. It hurt but I could more or less sleep through it. For myself it felt A LOT better when I was past the blisters stage. You have a lot of blisters. Be careful that you do not inadvertently pop them that hurt like a mother. Ideally these bad boys will dry out to pepperonis.
7443,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine they said I will most likely get a flare in my older age but ya I can die from chicken pox as an adult vs a kid
7445,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I got shingles during a very stressful period when I was 19. It was a very mild case but the scars still hurt every time I got sick or hung over for 3 years. So now that I think about it I guess I have shingles to thank for my healthy relationship with alcohol. But yeah it was awful every time I felt crummy I also had horrible shooting pains in my side. Highly recommend doing whatever you can to avoid if possible
7447,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: The first shot kicked my as s so not sure what the 2nd one will be like sad but relieved face
7448,: I have a friend who took the jab. Her left eye got infected a year ago and almost popped out of her eyeball. She told me yesterday it happens again and that the doctors are going to do a larger investigation to find out what is wrong.
7449,Just added methotrexate to my Rinvoq as per my new rheumatologist....and almost immediately got shingles. I had both Shingrix shots about 5 or 6 years ago which really helped it was mostly just around my neck a little on my chest. Let me tell you it really hurts Got on anti virals immediately still on them. Anyway.....going to ask my rheumie in a couple months if I should get vaccinated again ? Anyone experienced this ? Also going to not take the low dose methotrexate in the meantime.
7450,: I had sinus surgery one month ago. A large blood clot came out of my nose. It had six white stringy short things attached that looked like tentacles on it. The things stuck out of the clot and looked rubbery. I took screenshots but do not know how to add one of them. I am 74 and received the first two Moderna immunizations.
7453,TN and shingles vaccine: I absolutely believe that my gn is somehow caused by the shingles virus. I have had frozen shoulder and I believe that was brought on by a shingles outbreak. I do not know of any study or research following up on this. I wish there were.
7455,Hi Please bear with me as I am pretty new to Reddit this post is a bit long yawning and PEM alert and some of what I am about to mention further below may sound a little crazy. My history with Long Covid and stuff that brought me back 2022 So for starters I first got Long Covid following two infections in March and June of 2022 one unknown virus and the other confirmed Covid. That year they thought I had thyroid issues as my face puffed up I lost bodyweight and a goitretype lump was found however an ultrasound and bloods revealed nothing. I also had a chest xray and the usual round of bloods and everything fine so Post Viral Illness was the diagnosis. My other symptoms then were bad fatigue flulike feeling and PEM. I recovered after around 3 months to about 8590 just by restingpacing. 2023 I was doing pretty good not 100 though until the spring of 2023 when I got reinfected most likely Covid and suffered a TBI. I went downhill badly and developed Long Covid symptoms much worse than 2022 minus the weird thyroid type stuff. I ended up taking 4 months off work plus what was looking to be a doomed to fail phased return as was in bed most of the time. Symptoms were  Horrendous fatigue  PEM  Brain fog poor memoryforgetfulness repeating words inability to concentrate etc. the usual  Pretty severe depression with bouts of anxiety that came in seemingly unpredictable waves  More sensitive to light  Constant head pressureache  Wateryirritated right eye this I remedied by using Castor oil eye drops  Blurry and jumpy vision this may have been TBI related initially but some appears to be permanent now as lost the really closeup clear vision I used to have.  Recurrent tongue sores on right side of tongue only  Intermittent tinnitus in the right ear  Gut issues these actually developed later on when ill  More visible veins I tried loads of things this time around including selfinjecting B12 which brought me up to 85 for all of a couple of weeks at most then back down again though a little better overall also NAC creatine taurine Naproxen etc. Whilst researching I became convinced that I was suffering from some sort of viral persistencereactivation particularly given the tongue sores sight and hearingrelated issues which were only on one side apparently this often occurs in viruses from the herpes family?. Eventually I tried Lysine for 4 weeks at the upper safe daily dose of around 5g which gave me tremendous relief and back up to 85. But after inadvertently taking a batch that was 3 years out of date I went downhill fast. I decided then to try Aciclovir hoping that a highdose of that would finally do the trick to get rid of whatever this was and get me to 100. I was unable to obtain this from my UK doctor surgery so out of frustration and desperation I purchased some online. I started out on a Shingles dose and within days it was like someone had turned the lights on. I felt absolutely amazing. I ended up going down to 800mg twiceday apparently this dose is given to transplant patients for a year to suppress Herpes viruses until I managed to get down to 400mg twice a day I tried stopping completely earlier this year but symptoms slowly returned. Throughout the 10 months I reached 8590 again and was able to return to work fulltime after just a week of week of the antiviral resume walking my dogs the usual social and family stuff major DIY and even climbed a mountain. Until 2024 Broke my coccyx on a trampoline in August suffered a period of stress and got reinfected again in September So here I am again though better than last year currently. The 400mg twice a day of Aciclovir did not save me it felt like my shield but clearly too much of an assault for it on a lowish dose I ceased the Aciclovir completely and replaced with 2g of Lysine which I have recently upped to 4g. I am very reluctant to start out on another high dose of Aciclovir as I am working in the dark without tests and I never did reach 100. The antivirals can also be hard on the kidneys and gut with several other common side effects trying to repair gut currently and also explore vascular issues. Although the symptoms are pretty much identical as last time so I am still chasing viral persistence thinking that its probably not just reactivated viruses but also maybe pockets of the Covid virus hanging out in immune privilegedhard to reach sites as research seems to be gathering on. This brings me on to. Electroceuticals Desperate for a lasting solution to eventually reach 100 and not wanting to chuck more medicinessupplements down my throat and hopemoney down the drain I thought what have I got already that might just help. Then I remembered I have an EMS machine bought years ago. I am familiar with its uses for things like Bells Palsy muscle toning etc. but thought what if there is more that these can do? So I found a ton of research on the benefits of electroceuticals in general such as damaging viruses including Covid EBV and HIV and bacteria whilst not damaging the body activation of B and T cells reduction in inflammation tissue healing boosting circulation mood and brain health improving the effectiveness of medication etc. So not just good for Viral persistence. I have linked just a tiny few of these below Potential of electric stimulation for the management of COVID19 Reduction of Viral and Bacterial Activity by Using a SelfPowered VariableFrequency Electrical Stimulation Device Biomedical applications of electrical stimulation  PMC NCBI Stopping the spread of viruses during surgeries using electric fields I have just started using my EMS for short sessions with the dial turned quite low with the red leadspads on forehead and black leadspads on the back shoulder areas using 20hz and 1sec on and off so pretty much continuous pulsing. I have also heard people stimulating the vagus nerve so purchased an ear attachment and am excited to see how this goes too. Obviously there are places I would not place them like heart neck etc. and there may be conditions for which this is unsuitable but for me this seems to check out fine. I have definitely felt a difference. This could of course be a placebocoincidence as I have been experiencing improvements following a tonn of resting and probably the Lysine but I really want to explore this further. Just wanted to share this in case it may be helpful to some. I am going to keep researching as just kind of jumped in with what I have here and what I have skim read but this field of medicine seems to be gaining momentum and makes for very interesting reading. Update 11th Nov I have been having really exciting results with this I appreciate that as I am doing other stuff too that this is pretty flawed as trials go of course. I have now switched to placing electrodes on my upper arms as started wondering whether it really matters where they are placed for what I am attempting re viral persistence safely of course since our blood is circulating. I thought about placing them on my gluteals for the bonus of muscle toning as they have had the least activity since all this but decided would be too restrictive I also intend to try a much longer stint as I could not find anything to say this should only be done for short periods. I originally did it on my forehead for just a few short sessions to relieve head pressure which has worked but figured placing them elsewhere might be less distracting and relaxing it is. Re the vagus nerve ear attachment it gave me a nice relaxed feeling so may be good for helping with sleep but was not as effective as using the pads for what I am trying. I also found the ear attachment clip hurt my ear after a short while.
7458,Shingles vaccine experience: Yes I had it right under my boob and around to my back. I could not do anything but lay shirtless with an ice pack on it.
7460,2024 White clot survey results: Shedding IS real as well in my experience I hugged 3 times and got sick 3 times instantly It is not normal to get instant symptoms of a flu and not feel it come on gradually. I also had shingles.
7463,Shingles vaccine: Do Not know about shingles but I Have dealt with Covid. Covid vaccine knocked me out for a day of so. Covid knocked me out for a week or so. Unvaccinated family members felt like they were going to die from Covid. Id have to imagine the vaccine might be a little tough but its better than the disease itself.
7469,: They knew all ALONG disgusting and despicable human beings i had a stroke this time last year and believe it was the Vaccine and I have said it to it cardiovascular department and they just look at you as they look at you as if your MAD
7470,"Getting two vaccines at once: The shingles vaccines made me feel horrible for a couple of days, but I know it's better than getting shingles. It was rough, though."
7473,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I got it up and down my inner arm
7475,Shingles vaccine: I have not had it because I Am not old enough yet but I will get it the literal day I can. Shingles is hell on earth. A family member has had it for the past four months and is going blind from it. I had it for a few weeks and it was the worst sickness I Have ever encountered. My threshold is very high
7477,Shingles vaccine: I just got my second shingles shot this past Saturday. Other than a sore arm for a day or two it was fine. The same with the first dose. Trust me a little muscle soreness is much preferable to full blown shingles.
7481,That second shingles vaccine hits hard
7484,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My first shot wasn't too bad. Arm ached for a few days but otherwise I was fine. It was the combination of the second shot and my infusion treatment that whooped my ass for a week. But I'm glad I got this over with.
7485,Shingles shot Ack: I had the Shingles vaccine and did not experience any symptoms other than the usual sore arm. Same for the second dose.
7486,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: Mine did fine. She slept 7 hours straight the night after which scared me half to death until I realized that they can be way sleepier after vaccines.
7488,Shingles vaccine: I am also wondering about this. One of my eye specialists suggested I get it as my fatigueeye issues started after I had the shingles at 42. He was concerned about a potential recurrence. My primary doctor did not know how to get it approved since technically I Am too young to get it. But I also had now inactive Morphea as a result of a chicken pox infection at age 5. That was only recently diagnosed by a dermatologist. Since shingles is a reactivation of the varicella virus and I that virus likes to wreak havoc on my systems I do not know whether the shingles vaccine would be safe for me. If someone deems it safe for me I will definitely get the vaccine when I Am eligible. Having the shingles is awful. I hope you have wellinformed healthcare professionals who can help you decide what is best for you.
7489,Good idea. We Have both had ours and the follow up injection which must be done before 6 months is up. We felt pretty crook afterwards but that eases up. Better than having the shingles that is for sure.
7490,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had mine at around 45 yep it hurts. My sharpest pain the one that sneaks up on you and makes you almost drop to your knees thankfully was just one nerve in my rib. Find some good tanks under your clothes and pajamas no scratching etc. With me although it hurt like hell for about 2 months it was like a freaking vacation. Nobody bugged me nobody asked me to do anything I was highly contagious in everyone is eyes during the pandemic lol No driving someone somewhere....would have been nicer without the pain but I almost enjoyed my shingles LOL
7491,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My partner had this. You Will feel much better tomorrow.
7496,22 Most ins cos do not cover . Check. Medicare does now I think. Mymy husband's bodies got shingles 2X few yrs post vaccine You will suspect. Get to Drurgent care IMMEDIATELY. Takes one look to diagnose. If ANTIVIRAL begun win 48 hrs controlsstops spread. WORTH. EVERY. CENT
7500,Oh wow I Am not alone.: Thanks Had to google some words not going to lie. I was warned with the surgery that down the road I would have to do it again. In fact at my last dentist appointment I was complaining about an upper tooth and they showed me on an Xray that the tooth was fine but the sinus cavity above it was goofy implying that some of the issue was starting to come back. Yay. I think my issues were twofold My sinuses were horribly clogged up most definitely under my eyes but also the ones between my eyebrows at the top of my nose too. So rotorootering them out is what unleashed an onslaught of bacteria from like 17 years of sinus infections that tanked my immune system causing the RHSshingles. I Have since been able to get the shingles shot I have had several RHS recurrences over the years so ifwhen I have to have that surgery again at least Ill have done what I can to guard against the RHS fallout. Inside my nose yeah I had fried it pretty well it was all kinds of swollenboth from the sinus infection and just the cycle of blowing my nose too much and irritating tissue and then from the afrin frying or whatever we are calling that. The swelling from any source is what pushed my septum over to the right my left sinus was the worst offender which also clogged up the right side of my nose a bit more. So after they rotorootered my sinuses they put like splints on my septum to realign it. I do not think they actually had to cut back like tissue just do the things to reduce swelling and then hold everything back in its place until it healed to where it was supposed to be. My original issues were not really allergy related. I had pneumonia as a baby pretty bad so that kind of screwed over my lungs and then I had asthma while playing sports in high school that has since become more of a regular asthma not every day definitely when playing sports but some days stuff must be kicked up funny or something. I did get allergy shots prepandemic but that was because it turned out I Am allergic to this specific old tree in my backyard where I now live not a factor when I was young. It was just colds respiratory viruses sinus infections that just started a clog cascade of good times. I hope some of this is helpful to anyone reading it. I know it goes on a bit but if anyone reading sees themselves in it like I saw from that 2008 Boston Globe article and it helps them out it was worth it.
7503,Long story short. I had internal anal warts HPV removed with a laser in August this year. Because three new warts appeared I Have got a second removal at the end of October. So far so good and no new warts appeared. I Have checked if these are cancerous and they are not. I Am vaccinated with Gardasil 9. Thing is I got back in touch with a guy I was hookingupmeeting in the past. We Have been talking online and finally met after almost 15 years of no contact. We were cuddling kissing no sex included but I know its going to happen at some point. And this is where my dilemma starts. Should I tell him or not? Some people say you need to disclose for at least 6 months after the last wart was removed. Some people say everyone has it and its not worth mentioning stats say 8090 sexually active people have it. Two doctors I Have been to also did not make a big deal out of it and said just use condoms which I always use anyway. They also said its only contagious when warts are visible andor my skin has an open wound. I Am more of a bottom so yeah my butt is going to be involved. I Am afraid if I tell him hell reject me. But I also want to be fair with him. I Do Not Know what to do.
7504,RSV vaccine Abryso because: My LO also got it in the hospital when he was born in December
7507,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah. Similar experience. I actually got shingles at 23 and no sooner had it cleared up I woke up with a bout of Bell's palsy. I hope I never experience either again.
7510,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles a year or so ago I Am mid 30s and it felt like my side and back were going to fall off. Knocked me for six for 2 or so weeks I was just grateful I did not get pustules or a rash. And the only thing that helped was taking an antibiotic not for bacteria but because it apparently has secondary benefits for nerve pain and puts you to sleep but I hate that I had to add to my already compromised immune system with unnecessary drugs. I Am sorry you got the chronic nerve pain especially if you had to go on Gabapentin or some such as that is a horrible drug as well.
7511,: cannot belive what I am listing to I refused the last vacation as was ill with the first and still suffering from shingles now my daughter only had the first one and her doctor banned her from the rest as was so ill this is terrible that the doctors etc are pushing this under the carpet thanks again for another very informative one
7515,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles was the single most painful experience in my life and I Have had two Csections. It was like someone was pounding a railroad spike into my temple.
7518,I Am a 26 year old female I broke my 6th rib from a bike accident about a month and a half ago. I was healing just fine and had almost no more pain until about 2 weeks ago when I woke up with awful nerve pain within my rib cage back up my shoulder neck numbnesstingling down my left arm and pain radiating down to my left knee. It felt sharp in certain areas and unrelenting dull aching tightness around the entire area. To Be Honest I thought I had some really bad nerve damage and was very nervous. I did notice some itchy redness popped up on my neck a few days after the pain started and just dismissed it as maybe just some skin irritation. It died down after a bit and I finally went to my doctor about the pain I was experiencing this was Thursday and it still had not subsided. We discussed many possibilities such as slipped rib thoracic outlet syndrome possibility of my injury not healing correctly and shingles. She asked if I had a rash anywhere I had completely forgotten about the redness on my neck atp and said no. I did not even think shingles was a possibility. So she ordered blood work and a CT scan which i am going in for this week. However I woke up Friday with another flare up on my neck and this time it was red itchy spotspatches that seemed more aggravated. I Am still having the nerve painnumbness all around my ribs chest neck shoulder leg and arm. It was this morning as I was itching and looking at it that I put 2 and 2 together did some research and I think I may have shingles. I Have never broken anything before or had significant physical trauma up until this rib break. Has anyone else experienced similar trauma and ended up with shingles?? It seems like the rash can show up in different areas of the body outside the region of injury. I Have been really down about this whole experience it feels like i have just been dealing with so much uncertainty. So any thought experiences recommendations would seriously help
7521,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got my 2 jabs in late 2023. Both my mum and husband have suffered with shingles. They were both in a lot of pain and my husband had a terrible case all on the right side of his body even on his face. In our province the vaccines are NOT covered by insurance for those under age 65. I paid about 160 for each jab. Take my money
7523,Vaccines: I got shingles pneumonia and tetanus. And I regularly get the Covid and flu vaccine Everything else I was up to date on

I'm sorry you're going through this!"
7527,Night sweats after 3rd shingles shingrix vaccination: Did they give you 3 shots for a reason? The website says 2 shots and my medical insurance says 2 as well.
7531,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Just want to say shingles is hell. I had it on my ear. Its because of stress its triggered by it. I would work on stress management for people that had chickenpox.
7533,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles at 30 in my face during one of the most stressful times of my life. It sucks and it left scars but at least i did not lose my eyesight If I was able to get vaccine i would but I am still too young
7534,I was vaccinated for Covid and got a very mild case one time. I was also vaccinated against shingles and I will probably never have them. Because I am not dumb like that. I have also been vaccinated for rabies you never know when that will come in handy because of a job.
7538,"A roofer with shingles. How ironic...: Did you get the antiviral within 72 hours of the rash appearing? Even if later still take it! Also, you're extremely contagious until it starts to scab over and heal. When you got your child the vaccine did you mention to their doctors you have shingles?"
7539,Hey everyone Went for a follow up with my rheum today and she is advised if I am going to stay on Rinvoq I am I should get the pneumonia and shingles vaccines. She is ordered them to my local pharmacy for me so my question is really about timing. Who is had these vaccines and did you have any kind of reaction to them? I am debating if I go in for the vaccines on a weekday and just get it over with or if I wait until Saturday to avoid missing any work to potential reactions. I had very little reaction to the flu shot this year but COVID vaccines have historically jumped my fatigue levels up significantly making it difficult to work. I know everyone is different in how they react to vaccines but figured it does not hurt to ask and gauge from there. Thanks for any experiences you can share
7540,First Time With Shingles. Was Not Bad But Would Not Want Again. How Well Did the Vaccine Work For You?: I am in a bad flare of Crohn's atm. My immune system is weak. Waiting to start Humira I have been hit with shingles for the first time. it is mild thankfully. My g.p. recommends 2 Shingrix shots in 12 months' time. Apparently we are more susceptible to getting it. I do wish it was not so much out of pocket though.
7541,Shingles vaccine experience: Sorry to hear that. The good news is I didn t have a reaction to the second shot.
7542,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Did you have it yourself? Was it very localized or did you have a big outbreak? My brother only had it on the back of his thumb but a friend of mine had a broad stripe of it all the way around his abdomen. Terrifying.
7546,Shingles vaccine experience: I thankfully did not have anything other than a slightly sore arm from both Shingles vaccinations. Even if I had gotten flulike symptoms it would have been so much less horrific than Shingles. 1010 would do it again.
7547,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Mine were vaccinated for it and thankfully it was far less severe when they did eventually get it.
7549,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Caught it twice. First time was just a natural contraction. 2nd time was from the vaccine. Born in 95.
7550,Baby and me with COVID please help me not panic: My daughter now almost 3yo and I have both had COVID twice together. Our first exposure was from daycare. She tested positive for both RSV and COVID at 8 months old. The rules in our state at that time were that she had to stay home for 10 days and my son who was 2 at the time had to stay home for 14 days as he was a close contact. My husband and I tested positive a few days after my daughter. For the adults we both each had 1 bad day where we could not get out of bed but after that 1st day passed we were able to care for the kids. We did not mask in the house and still somehow our son did not get COVID. It was hard to know if it was the COVID andor the RSV but my daughter was sick for about a week. She was on a nebulizer and fever meds. I had to suck her nose constantly and focused on making sure she was able to nurse so that she remained hydrated. But again she was fine after a week. I was riddled with guilt like full on depressed about her catching COVID. We literally went nowhere in 2021 except tofrom daycare and I was just sosad. So I understand how you can feel guilty as well but these things can happen no matter how diligent we are. About 6 months later my daughter caught COVID again from daycare. I had now been vaccinated but also got COVID again. I sent my husband and son away so they could start healthy and stayed home with my daughter. Her symptoms were not as bad as the first infection but she did not have RSV this time either. She did not have a fever but had mild cold symptoms. I actually felt worse with the second infection than with the first. I feel like we both slept a lot for 23 days. My husband and son did not get infected. About 6 months after that I got COVID a 3rd time. I believe I was exposed at a Christmas party my husband and I went to without the kids. Id had a booster shot. I quarantined for 5 days then masked in our home after the 5 day quarantine for another 5 days. No one else was infected
7551,Second Shingles Shot: No effects from first or second shingles shot for me. I got freaked out reading all the bad posts but nothing. Covid shots make me feel crummy but shingles shots were a breeze. Hopefully the same for others.
7552,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I also got shingles at 36. Nursing school is very stressful. Thankfully I had a mild case and hopefully I will never get it again. The outbreak was on my spine and left rib area. It was truly awful. I cannot imagine having it on my face or somewhere more visible
7555,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles can show up in places like your eyes. It can come back for a total of three times. It can leave you with permanent pain. Any vaccine reaction is preferable. Most people have injection site pain at worst. My arm ached bone deep so I took some Celebrex. Post herpetic neuralgia is no joke. I know someone who has to wear extra clothes and keeps a blanket around in the summertime because he gets cold on 8090 degree days.
7563,A couple of days ago I felt something like a splinter in my forehead but could not see anything. Today it was a line of sharp pain up my forehead any time anything touched my headmoved my hair My 6yo had shingles earlier this year from the chickenpox vaccine he had as a baby so the symptoms and side effects of face nerves getting infected were still fresh in our minds Just got back from doc with anti virals and nerve tonic Hopefully I got it in time

7573,am a 23 year old female. I am experience a tremendous amount of pain from rashes I Have been getting on my ankles and the tops of my hands. I Have seen numerous doctors dermatologists and was told it is not psoriasis and is not shingles. These rashes turn into legions and they blister causing an open wound. The pain feels like they are burning and a very sharp sensation to them. The move in different areas on my handsankles very quickly. I take Advil or Tylenol for the pain but nothing helps. I am in chronic pain with no answers and nothing to cope with. I feel helpless.
7574,here is to ya bastards my loyal crew Taking Shingrix having had GuillainBarre I bid you adieu See ya on the other side: Wow I figured shingles like chicken pox were a one time thing. I am sorry to hear about your getting gb s from the covid vaccine. I was very pro vaccine but dismayed at how people would just discount vaccine injuries well fewer than if covid ran rampant and yes I think that was true but in one case god universe random chance was picking the victims and in the other case the victims can from acts we did and mandated. I would mention that every so often to be called an anti vaccine x er which I thought was funny here I am the guy who actually had good reason to worry about vaccines yet still pro vaccine but suddenly the anti vaccine x er because I did not want to discount vaccine injuries
7576,Shingrix: It s a recombinant protein vaccine given as two dose to prevent shingles outbreaks. Chicken pox is a herpes virus that stays dormant in neurons. It can reactivate latter in life. This combined with declined immunity you get shingles. Very painful and can lead to blindness or other issues. Common side effects are sore arm fever fatigue etc for a day or two. The fever and fatigue is more common than most vaccine vaccines. The protein is derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells. It will not turn you into a hamster. It has an ad juv ant derived from sap on in from a plant and lipid from salmonella. It will not give salmonella. package insert

I esperienced these pains wherever I had shingles. The worst of it was over by month 5 however I still get them occasionally 4 years later.

7593,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Not usually. It is an itchy blistery rash on the body or rarely the face. I am not sure what sort of shingles would need one's son and husband to supply roundtheclock nursing When I had it I recognized the symptoms right away went to the doctor that day and got an antiviral.
7597,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Aside from the fact that your husband locked your sick child in your car I am so sick of people that say it will not kill you. Chickenpox still has a death rate even in 2024 and although it is been almost 30 years ago when the vaccine did not exist for it I had it when I was 6yo and will NEVER forget it. I got severely sick from it. High fevers vomiting at every little thing etc. I could not take medication orally because of how sick I was. I had to take suppositories...which was horrendous and embarrassing at that age and I was almost hospitalized. Not to mention now poor little Annie will have to worry about shingles the rest of her life which are excruciatingly painful. All of this could have been avoided if MIL kept her fat nose to her own business and husband had a spine and cared about his daughter. If I was OP I would divorce and never look back. Protect that baby at all costs from these monsters.
7605,Highly favored: My baby came November and she has not been sick at all we did get the rsv vaccine for her but she has not had a thing

7610,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Worth it. I had shingles when I was going through chemo and the shingles was brutal.
7611,How many women have taken cervical cancer vaccine or HPV vaccine?: I am 26 and have been active since I was 18. Not sure how but I have never been offered the vaccine or asked if I had it I think my university assumed I had it I went to high school in Europe and university in the US. I had not had sex in about 1.5 years and am a huge germaphobe met someone and datedhad sex for 3 months I have never HPV nor an STDsinfectionsnothing my whole life. Went for a routine check up and had an abnormal pap smear that showed HPV and aSquamouscells I had ZERO symptoms would not even know about it if I had not gone for the check up. Went through a colposcopy and had my first HPV dose scheduled for 2nd and 3rd. The horror and pain I went through during the colposcopy will be with me for the rest of my life I will NEVER let a man touch me again without seeing his HPV vaccine records STDmedical records and I am more than happy to stay manfree to never feel that pain again. Typically I have soreness or fatigue from vaccines I felt NOTHING from the HPV vaccine. I just wish I could go back in time and have gotten it sooner. Please please get the vaccine and protect yourself do not put your health and mental health at risk like I did.
7615,30YO with facial shingles first time: Sorry you are dealing with this I Am not sure I Am much help because mine were t3t4 chestback but for me the swelling looked a lot better after week 2. By the end of week 3I felt almost 100. I do still have some hyperpigmentation but I Am super fair skinned and I Am sure it will fade completely in time. I Am not sure if you have access to a rednearinfrared light panel. I know some gyms have them or you could get one from Amazon. I have one and it has been shown to help calm skin issues. You could also maybe look into a supplement called Arnica. It helps with swelling. Hang in there You will feel better soon
7616,Shingles vaccine: I kicked off 2020 with Shingles That deep burning constant pain had me quarantining before quarantining was even a thing
7617,Pregnant women urged to get vaccine that could prevent thousands of baby hospitalisations: Literally this. I am nearly 25 weeks pregnant and I only had my whooping cough vaccination yesterday. Everyone online kept telling me it was routinely offered at the 20 week scan appointment it was not that I could get it at my hospitalGP I could not. I asked about it at my 16 week appointment because I am the opposite of vaccine hesitant jab me up baby and ended up getting sent round the houses completely. I even tried to book it privately and pay for it because it was suggested to me on here and was told they would not offer it privately because there was not enough demand since it is free at your GP. It took me 9 weeks of regular nagging to get an appointment and even then it was an appointment at a health centre two junctions down the motorway. Fine for me as I drive and it is currently the holidays so I am not in work but I can imagine there would be lots of women who would not be able to travel for that. I absolutely want the RSV vaccine and the flu jab and any other vaccination they can possibly offer that might protect my baby. I am pregnant and completely knackered though  I do not know if I can manage a prolonged battle just to get a 3 minute appointment.
7626,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles at 27. It was caused by camping in unusually cold weather that I was unprepared for. Cold Stress. It clears up quick but incredibly painful.
7627,"Pfizer Covid Vaccine and Swelling: After getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I noticed some unusual swelling in my arm at the injection site. At first, I didn't think much of it, assuming it was a normal reaction. But as the days went by, the swelling continued to worsen, becoming red and tender to the touch. I reached out to my healthcare provider, who advised me to monitor the swelling and apply ice packs to reduce inflammation. However, despite following their instructions, the swelling persisted and even started to spread to other parts of my body. I'm now experiencing discomfort and limited mobility due to the swelling, and it's starting to worry me. Has anyone else encountered similar issues after receiving the Pfizer vaccine? I'm not sure if this is a common side effect or if I should seek further medical attention. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated."
7629,"Just got my second dose of the chicken pox vaccine, or so I thought. Turns out, the nurse at my doctor's office accidentally gave me the shingles vaccine instead. Now I'm dealing with a sore arm, sore throat, and feeling pretty miserable from the side effects. Has anyone else experienced this mix-up before? Any advice on what steps I should take next or what I can expect?"
7630,I had the single dose version years ago. I had shingles so they limited me to a single shot. I do not know why. It was not too bad. I was fortunate.
7632,This happened at a Walmart pharmacy in Houston Texas. My dad previously both of his shingles vaccines. He took the first dose as a Walmart in Houston and a second dose at another Walmart in Katy suburb of Houston. Yesterday when he went to the Walmart pharmacy the pharmacist said that he had not gotten his second shingles vaccine so he went ahead and got it. After taking the vaccine the pharmacist printed the state vaccine record and saw that he revived another second vaccine i.e. he got 3 doses. The pharmacist claims that she could not see it on her end even though this info was clearly in the state record. My dad is running a fever now and I Am afraid of any adverse side effects that may arise long term from this. What is the best way to proceed legally? As a medical professional myself there was obviously a system error but I do not know who to hold accountable and how.
7633,Shingles and other Vaccines: I always get sick for 24 to 36 hours after vaccination. Chills fever fatigue. Is it worth it? Yes I Have seen people that have had shingles pneumonia and severe cases of Covid. I do not ever want to go through that if I can help it. I always plan for it in advance.
7634,Shingles: got mine in March and I still have nerve pain from it. Tramadol helps more than other pain killers.
7635,Same but I got the flu shot in the same arm. NOT as sore as shingles shot however
7636,Hi there. I had shingles for the first time in Dec 2022. Started as a weird pain in the center of my back and the next day turned into what felt like someone had taken sandpaper from that spot all the way across the left to my belly button. I believe this is the T9 or 10 dermatome. A day or so after that spaced out clusters of very small blisters appeared. Never really had an ugly rash just the blisters and intense pain in those areas. Also fatigue and general feelings of unwell. Got antivirals maybe a week into it because it was the holidays. It cleared up in a few weeks. Fast forward to this past Sunday morning. Woke up with the same pain same spot in the center of my back. Yesterday sandpaper feeling but now across the right side. Exact same path as last time though. Today is continued it has abatedchanged slightly. The area feels achier but less tingling more sunburned. No rash or blisters that I can see. Based on your personal experience should I expect this to be full blown shingles in a few days? It really feels like it but I cannot tell if I Am overreacting. Note I saw the doctor today. He said its rare for someone my age to get it twice within a few years but that I am under an abnormal amount of stress. I have a child with ASD we were actually there for him first lol. So he told me to come back if I get a rash. Edit I am female almost 37. Any help or feedback is appreciated. Thank you.
7637,Bein39 Ian With Jordan Episode 080 Pin Monkey W Andrew Santino: shingles and rashes are side effects from the jab
7640,Daycare Sickness: We have a 15m girl and she started daycare around 5.5 months in the middle of July. She did not get her first illness till midSeptember. It was a very mild ear infection. Then she kind of had sniffles on and off from September thru April with the sporadic fevercold that she stayed home for. Luckily she seemed to have avoided RSV flu and covid this past season. She was vaccinated against all of them. Overall I think we got lucky with the mildness of her sicknesses compared to others. We live in New England by the way.
7642,The shingles vaccine sucks.: My doctor told me that it is possible to experience aftershocks for up to 2 years after your initial outbreak. It is been 2 years for me now and I did feel a couple of pings here and there but nothing serious thankfully.
7643,Once. My husband and I got sick on the same day. I used an at home test and got mild positive for covid. Felt bad for one day. Had a cough for a few days. Honestly I felt worse after getting the shingles vaccine.
7645,Shingles vaccine: I had it twice in the same year  different places. My mom has had it twice  40 years apart. Second time got post herpetic neuralgia.
7646,shingles???: I Am also on Rinvoq had the shingles vaccine and still got shingles. It was very painful
7647,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: The shingles vaccine can make you feel like utter shit for a night. As much of an ass pain as it is Id separate the two especially since you are having immune issues. I just had this conversation with my doc yesterday she suggested I do the Covid booster and shingrix separately and I have an immune system issue too friggin celiac disease.
7652,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: As someone who has had shingles at 26 6 months after giving birth to my own daughter. I had blisters all over one breast and have permanent nerve damage from my outbreak. They would have had to call the cops because I would have gone ape shit. I hope his mother suffers greatly. I hope he watches while it happens. I hope you inform him that is what he has condemned his child to suffer in the future. You need a lawyer and a protective order.
7654,Shingles vaccine: Lupus patients even 20 year olds are 3 times more likely to get shingles than elderly healthy people. I had an unvaccinated patient end up with a permanently paralyzed arm from shingles attacked the muscle nerves a tough guy 30 year old refused the vaccine and ended up with such severe nerve pain it had him crying for pain relief help his whole family then got vaccinated I could go on and on with horror stories. I have never seen a severe reaction to shingrix in many years of using it. Sure lots of sore arms some flu like reactions a couple mild flares but they pale in comparison. I beg my patients to get Shingrix Good luck with your decision choice I worry about my unvaccinated patients Donald Thomas
7655,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had it in my eye too
7659,Shingles vaccine: I had both. The first one I got in my nondominant arm and the second one in my dominant arm. The second one hurt less as I was forcing myself to keep using the arm heck I even did arm day at the gym the next day. I did not get sick but it hurt a lot going in  like the liquid is thick or something?
7661,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Wife and I are 73 and got it 2 years ago. Not cheap two shots each. I think about 175 each. From the description of what shingles can do money well spent.
7663,Life Christmas stress....I do not know what triggered it but take my word you do not want this. Ringing in the new year in pain and feeling old.
7665,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: Not siblings but... My almost 8 month old got the RSV vaccine at 4 months. She is been in daycare since she was 9 weeks old. A classmate of hers got RSV and was out for a week about 2 months ago and she did not get it.
7669,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: Out of all the shots I got this pregnancy the RSV was the easiest. No side effects not even soreness. I Am thrilled its available in this pregnancy since my babies are going to be born in the height of respiratory illness season. I got TDaP Covid flu RSV and not a vaccine but still a shot I had to get RHOgam twice because I had some early bleeding and then at the normal time.
7670,"40,433 adverse events from the Covid-19 vaccinations in the USA reported to VAERS so far.: This includes 127 deaths, along with 769 cases of abdominal pain, along with 1,410 cases of amnesia, dizziness, disorientation, vertigo, confusion, and delirium, along with 1,531 cases of fatigue, along with 1,117 cases of herpes zoster, along with 717 cases of headache and head injury from falls, along with 521 cases of influenza-like-illness, along with 57 cases of blindness and deafness, along with 175 cases of eye swelling, eye discharge, and eye pain, along with thousands of other ill effects. What percentage of vaccine reactions get reported? The list at this link includes a wide variety of adverse events as can be seen in the spreadsheet provided: <url>"
7671,Yeah the side effects were not fun. But I had one bout of shingles near my eye before the vaccine and that pain was far worse. Having experienced both I would advise anyone over 50 to get the vaccine.
7673,41 and got Shingles: I had shingles at about age 39. That was not pleasant. I was laid up for about a week.
7678,Shingles vaccine experience: Get the second shot early in the morning when you will be physically active all day. I have been getting my vaccines this way for a few years now and in my experience it really minimizes soreness.
7680,Paranoid about shingles: I did the first shot before starting and the second once I was on it. It was just the way the timing work out. I did not have a worse reaction with the second than the first. Both were pretty similar from what I remember.
7682,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I got the second dose 64 days after the first one and did not have a reaction to it but then again I do not recall having a reaction to the first dose either I just went about my day as usual.
7688,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: This is why I do not brag about shit.
7689,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I have Shingles and some headchest thing right now. So mad at myself for not getting the shot.
7690,"Should i get shingrix at 22?: I've had shingles twice in the last two years, the second time with long term effects. My doctor said if I get the vaccine, I may still get rashes but the nerve damage is less likely to happen again. She had to prescribe the vaccine for me, the pharmacy said they wouldn't give it without a prescription because I'm too young."
7691,Put me out of my misery.: Actually everyone is severity varies.I Have had shingles twice but low severity. Three blisters the first no blistering but severe muscle spasms the second.
7698,Shingles vaccine causing horrific pain: I will not be getting any more vaccines ever again. Wish my immune system luck.
7699,Shingles vaccine experience: Id rather have a sore arm for a few days than the shingles.
7700,Shingles vaccine: Hi. I am in my late 30s. Got shingles after COVID. It is not too much of an exageration to say it has been life ruining I cannot feel part of my face my eyeball is scarred and may not be a repair case so I am stuck with permanent dry eye and irritation my scalp is scarred so my hair has thinned massivly on that side let us not talk about the nerve pain past a year now so likely forever. I am so scarred demelinated too on that facial quadrant someone asked me if I would been in a car accident recently. By the way this is still counted as a mild case for the optic nerve shingles. I am lucky I still have my sight Get the vaccine. It is an awful disease.
7703,Today its Christmas and I woke up with a legit amount of anxiety. By The Way Merry Christmas to everyone and thank you for reading me. I Am 25F and was diagnosed with MS in October24 after my first symptoms appeared back in January24. It started with numbness and tingling on the left side of my body after a motorbike accident. At first I thought it was related to my ulnar nerve or even a cervical hernia I go to the gym but within a few days it spread to my trunk and left leg. It all resolved on its own in 10 days but I later noticed Lhermittes sign which prompted my GP to refer me to a neurologist. After an MRI and spinal tap I was diagnosed 9 months later after the first symptoms ever. I have two small spinal lesions and a few brain spots. My first neurologist recommended starting natalizumab but I transferred to a specialized center closer to home. There my bloodwork showed a high JCV index 3.5 and while they still suggested natalizumab with close monitoring the PML risk scared me. I chose Kesimpta instead thinking it would also offer more flexibility I Am moving to a new city in March and cannot go back to home to get monthly infusions also I do not want to wait again to be transferred to another specialized centre. However I did not realize Id need to complete vaccinations shingles zoster pneumonia before starting with Kesimpta which means I will not begin until midFebruary25. Now I Am torn  Natalizumab I could start as soon as January 20th but the PML risk weighs heavily on me. Also Ill be living in another city so there would be some logistic issues. After 61218 months who knows Id switch to Kesimpta.  Kesimpta Feels safer and more convenient but Ill have to wait until February 13th to start. I Am struggling to balance the urgency of starting treatment with my fears and logistical concerns. What would you do in my situation? Does it really impact something to start with a 34 weeks of difference? I suppose my neuro pondered the risks and the outcomes to suggest me Kesimpta but since MS is not so predictable I Am really afraid I Am already on thin ice. Thank you for reading and I wish you a happy Christmas.  EDIT Thank you all for your kind and thoughtful responses. This community truly is wonderful and your support has reassured me so much. I Am new to this world and I admit I Have been feeling quite anxious about how things will unfold for me. My doctors have told me that I Am in an early phase of my illness and I Am determined not to lose the advantage of having received an 'early' diagnosis. My anxiety stems from the fact that I Have been unmedicated for a year which has been terrifying for me even if I had no relapses nor symptoms. Adding to that the lesions they found date back to August and its unsettling to think about how long MS might have been quietly progressing without my knowledge. After giving it much thought I think I Have decided to go with Kesimpta once I Have completed my vaccinations. As some of you mentioned certain vaccines like inactivated ones require a twoweek washout period before starting a CD20 therapy while others like the measlesmumpsrubella vaccine which is liveattenuated require a fourweek interval and two doses. This part worried me the most but I feel more informed and prepared now as I was completely unaware of the speed of progression of MS weeks? months? years?. I spoke with my neurologist whom I deeply trustshes one of the top researchers in both Italy and the USand her medical team as well. They still recommend natalizumab as the primary option but I just cannot cope with the anxiety surrounding the potential risks of PML. She also told me she cannot guarantee there will not be new lesions on my next MRI by waiting for another month scheduled for the end of January and I understand that. However I believe she would not have suggested Kesimpta if it were not reasonable to take the slight risk of waiting another month. I am trying so hard not to put myself under another kind of mental strain and this illness already feels like a zerosum game. You have NO idea well metaphorically you will have the idea how long I waited to finally get a diagnosis. In June I had my first neurology visit. Then they sent me to the hospital to check for potential spinal involvement. The following week I had a second neurological visit and underwent visual motor and somatosensory evoked potentials tests all negative. Next I was scheduled for an MRI in AUGUST. I had the MRI on August 7thright in the middle of PTO season in Italyso I had to wait for my neurologist to return to work to find out that I had some lesions and needed a spinal tap. Another two weeks passed and by September I finally had the spinal tap done. Then I had to wait an entire month October to get the results. A. Whole. Month. And of course everything came back positive. At that point I transferred to a center of excellence in my city. My first appointment there my third first neurology visit was not for another month. So I decided to pay out of pocket we have both public and private healthcare here and managed to see my new neurologist the following week. That same day they tested me for JCV with the results taking two weeks to come back. After that I underwent extensive multidisciplinary bloodwork coordinated by my rheumatologist and immunologist both of whom required specialized parameters to be checked. Finally by early December I received the therapy proposal. I Am incredibly grateful for our NHSits amazing that its freebut I feel absolutely drained. I Have been at the hospital almost daily for vaccines blood tests or other exams and I Am exhausted.
7705,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I was exhausted for at least a week after my blisters healed. I do not think your doctor has ever had shingles.
7707,I got shingles form last week and in 1st photo they are become dry but i am still itchy in other place like chest and arm and still appeared folliculitis like in 2nd photo in my chest .it is normal to keep getting new shingles even old shingles are dry?: Very valid question.. curious to see what comes up. I was actually thinking about that today I felt my neck while driving and felt something on my skin near where my case of shingles popped up. I have not looked yet but I will. This has got me thinking
7710,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I read that the shingles vaccine has a minimum age of 50 because it was only testedapproved for older people. I Have had both vaccines and I also had shingles pre shingrix and old vaccine 50 minor bouts and full on hellish case preshingrix vaccine The parents who do not vaccinate kids for chickenpox may not be fondly remembered when their kids then get shingles. Even asymptomatic chickenpox or just exposure.
7711,Family member who is 80 got the vaccine for shingles years ago. He has had shingles now for at least 5 years.
7716,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Id been putting off getting the vaccine and one day woke up with one eye swollen shut. No pain or redness. I went straight to urgent care and thankfully they recognized it as shingles and started me on the antiviral. I could have lost my eyesight if Id waited longer to go or they misdiagnosed.
7717,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Got damn shingles fucking suuuuucks I had no idea wtf was going on. I just knew I could not sleep the pain was so bad.
7721,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Gen X'er but I remember this being largely a crunchy mom thing. I got Chicken Pox the old fashioned way. When I turned 50 a few years ago I dutifully went and got my shingles vaccines. This January I got shingles. Turns out the vaccines I got only work for about 90 of the people that get them. I was in the lucky 10. Fortunately I figured out pretty quickly what was going on and was able to get started on antiviral quickly. I think my case was fairly mild maybe because the vaccine and also starting the antiviral. Still not a great experience and 010 do not recommend.
7726,Chickenpox Vaccine: Highly recommend my 1 year old had it she was quite tired afterwards and had suuuuuuch a long nap. But that was about it It protects against shingles later in life so definitely do it. We were lucky and got it on the NHS as her grandmother was immunocompromised so wanted her to not get chicken pox and be around her. They are rolling it out on the nhs for everyone soon so feel like you might as well get in there
7727,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Same here body aches fever fatigue. I was actually already feeling better by the afternoon the second day though
7729,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Dang I remember I had it when I was 3 or 4 9394 just before I started preschool. Do Not remember much of it apart from breaking out in rashes all over my parents applying ointments and other home remedies and bathing me in eucalyptus water. I want to assume that I got the chickenpox vaccine afterwards? Before? Id have to look for my vaccine record. I Am 34 am I at risk for shingles now? My doctor said they do not vaccinate until 50 or 60 cannot recall
7730,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Mine did it for me too. I Am lucky that when I got shingles 10 years ago when I was 42 that it was pretty mild. I got the shingles shot shingrix when I became eligible at 50 and dang it worked me over. Made the covid vaccine seem like a walk in the park.
7731,Let me fact check Its the HIV virus from the first booster with a side of shingles .
7733,The Mounjaro back pain is out of control: Search Mounjaro back pain and you will find out that it is something many people experience. I will update the post if it turns out to be kidney related got all the blood labs done today but the pain is too high for typical kidney issues and only happens after Mounjaro shots doc said Kidney inflammation does not comeandgo like that. PS love your username.
7741,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am 36 and just got the last shot of the series a few weeks ago. They did change the rules but I did not know that until my doctor offered my the vaccine last year.
7743,mRNA children39s trial suspended: I just spoke to a woman today who got the RSV vaccine here in the US and got really sick with respiratory infection after the shot.
7744,So I got diagnosed with shingles on 4th October was not expecting it when I went to doctor my rash was not painful and was a very small patch at my bikini line I just noticed the blisters after a few days of redness and went to the doctor. Had one week of aciclovir. Was doing ok rash was healing over and then just over a week ago spotted a few even tinier new red bumpsblisters in same spot. Cue another week of aciclovir. I am now finished that and fingers crossed the rash is looking good  there was no pain the 2nd time round and first go I had not that much pain more tiny electrical zaps. My main issue now is that for several weeks since finishing tablet set number one my mouth is so uncomfortable. Did not have Shingles there but I have had a few mouth ulcers not an unexpected thing but it literally feels like the gum inside my lips has been burned. It looks red and lumpy and unhappy and is worst when I wake up and my gums feel stuck to my teeth. I feel otherwise fine other than some slight residual tiredness...anyone else had this with their shingles? I just want to feel like a normal human again
7749,Valtrex experiences: I am not sure if I got Valtrex in particular but it looks like it is a brand of Valacyclovir which it what I started with. I did not get brain fog but did feel pretty bad taking it and my version of shingles was mild like you. I spoke to my doctor and got prescribed Acyclovir what Valacyclovir breaks down into after you ingest it and all my problems went away. I did this on day 3 though.
7752,Has anyone else gotten a covid booster AND shingles at the same appointment?: Same with responses to those vaccines. Covid really knocks me sideways.
7753,: My wifes brother who was 33 years old just died in his sleep a couple days ago. Unfortunately he was jabbed and boosted.
7754,Methotrexate Biologic and Shingles: I have been on meth rot rex ate since 2020 and I got shingles on my face on 2021. at the time I was on meth rot rex ate prednisone and r in vo q. I was already having a flare up caused by being off my meds for 2 weeks to get the C covid and flu vaccine and I went on a trip and I did not sleep my usual hours and I pushed my body too much because I was so excited about being in a new city and the dr believes since I put my body under so much stress while already having a flare up i ended up with the shingles but I did not know that is what it was and it ended up getting infected and it went to my eye. It was not fun. I had to stop meth rot rex ate and r in vo q for about 2 weeks to let my body heal and the scabs took almost 3 weeks to fall off completely. I actually had shingles again this past December because I was again having a flare up and I stressed myself too much again and I ended up getting again but it was very mild since I already know how it looks but I got it on the exact same spot. I had to be off my meds again for about 2 weeks. Hope you get better soon Just give your body a chance to heal. I am probably going to get the shingles shot in the next couple of months I hope it work because I do not want to get it again. It sucks.
7755,Second Shingles Shot: Had my 2nd one planned today but CVS cancelled the appointment last night. Rescheduled for next friday over at walgreens guess I will feel like shit next Saturday But really I have lucked out when it comes to vaccine and being sick. Most time they just make my arm hurt and I am fatigued.
7756,never tested again you have had it many times i have not even had the sniffles since 2019. multivaccinated. zero side effects other than a sore arm for a couple of days. the flu and shingles vaccines were much harder on me.
7757,Shingles vaccine: I have had three shots and none of them were anywhere near as bad as when I got shingles before the shots. I got it back in like 2015 and I still have noticeable scars. It sucked so hard. Get the shots.
7760,I swear to Christ this shit hurts like a motherfuck. Life is over
7763,Just finished with my second dose so I Am done for good. Shingles vaccine is horrible no getting around it.
7766,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Got my shots My brother an vaccine got shingles and it was so bad he encouraged me to get vaccinated.
7771,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Thank you. Let Us just say I Am pushing 50 and I will go get that vaccine as soon as I can. I NEVER want to go through that again. I still have nerve itching every now and then. Its awful.
7773,"Varicella vs Varicella Zoster vs Shingles/Herpes Zoster.: If my University requires a Varicella/ varicella zoster vaccine and the only option available in time is a shingles recombinant zoster vaccine, is that still technically a Varicella Zoster vaccine. I know it's the same virus, but is the vaccine the same? I've had the first chicken pox vaccine then caught it when I was younger so I never got the second dose, but now my school is saying I need it and I have one day."

7782,Shingles vaccine experience: I woke up to a rash on the right side of my back I started feeling strange. After a few days I go to the ER as soon as the doctor seen it he knew exactly what it was. I had Shingles the doctor asked me if I was in pain and I said no not really in any pain I just feel weird kind of sluggish. He asked me several times if I was in pain I kept repeating myself no pain. He could not believe I was not in excruciating pain. I did some research and I guess I should have been on fire in agonizing pain. I guess i dodged a bullet with that one.
7783,7.5mg for me: I am really liking it I took my 2nd of 7.5 last week. It does make me a bit more nauseous with smells but it seems a bit more normal feeling compared to the previous doses. Plus I am actually going to the bathroom which was an issue on 5 and my fatigue is minimal also an issue on 5. It does give me a rash at the injection sites which did not happen before but it does not hurt or itch.
7784,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I hope it was not too bad for you. I had some real gnarly shocks of nerve pain that were some of the worst pain I have ever felt.
7788,Hepatitis has returned?: My thyroid antibodies are insanely high for the past year and I can't get them down. Doctors are clueless.
7792,I recently started preparing for Kes imp ta and got all setup to get the Shingles vaccine before starting after reading this forum and seeing everyone recommend it. I am in Australia and our MS society does not even mention anything about needing it only a He p B checkup. I mentioned the Shingles vaccine to my neuro and she said I should not bother She said you already have antibodies for the Varicella Zoster virus so getting the vaccine will not make me any better off. I had chickenpox as a child so I knew that is how I had the antibodies so I decided to trust her that she knew what she was talking about but still felt a little iffy about not getting a booster vaccine just in case. Lo and behold within 2 weeks of starting Kes imp ta I got Shingles Ugh I am so angry disappointed in myself that I did not stick to my gut about this. My GP gave me some antivirals that seem to be clearing it up but gosh I will never NOT listen to this community again sometimes its the community that knows more about the lived experience than the Dr s
7793,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Ooof my husband had Ramsey hunt syndrome caused by ocular shingles 11 years ago he was so sick. I Am sorry you went though that And did not go to a chicken pox party but also born when there was no vaccine 85
7794,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Oh wow and I thought having shingles first at 18 was awful. It took a couple visits for a doctor to realize that is what was on my skin was shingles because it never happens in young people
7799,Shingles vaccine: I was vaccinated last month and had no side effects.
7800,"Unexpected Reaction to Vaccine - shingles: Hello friends, I wanted to share my recent encounter with shingles, which I believe may be linked to the Covid vaccine I received a month ago. I'm a 55-year-old male, and after my vaccination, I started experiencing a pins and needles sensation from my waist down. The tingling feeling extended to my legs, buttock, and even part of my arm. I also had a mild fever but no other symptoms at first. Concerned, I visited my doctor, and after some tests, it was confirmed that I had shingles. I was prescribed antiviral medication, which helped alleviate the pins and needles feeling. The blisters on my thigh, where it all started, were slightly itchy but improved with Vaseline and bandages. Thankfully, I've been able to return to work, albeit with a bandage on my leg. I consider myself lucky that my reaction to the vaccine-related shingles has been relatively mild compared to others. I'm hopeful that the pins and needles will subside soon. I'll keep you updated if there are any significant developments. Take care, everyone!"
7807,Shingles vaccine experience: I was getting heavy starch on my work shirts at the time I had shingles. I would try to sit still because any movement of my shirt against skin was excruciating.
7810,Shingles vaccine: Shingles lasts for months and can recur so get that vaccination. i got shingles after assurance from my mother that Id never had chicken pox. The pain is massive. The meds for the pain gabapentin is effective for the pain but also stirs your brain with a stick. Depression sleep issues irrational anger etc. doc told me to get the vaccine when it seemed to be tapering off so I didnot realizing my immune system had burned to the ground so the first shot put me back in the bed with a relapse. GET THE VACCINE. The effects are no where near how bad you will feel with shingles.
7813,It may be tough but it beats the heck out of shingles itself I Am here to tell you. I was only 30 and at the time there was no treatment. I do not wish it on anyone. Get the shot. I Am sorry in advance for your discomfort afterwards.
7816,Shingles vaccine: Shingles vaccinations are free at most chain drugstores here. That being said I had my shingles series and have not gotten shingles but did feel off for a few days after. Seeing a friend go through shingles it was no big deal to deal with some feeling off.
7818,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I chicken pox as a kid because the vaccine was not out yet. I was still required to get the vaccine as an adult when I immigrated to the USA though. You can walk into any pharmacy in the US and just get it on request.
7829,"Tips/tricks before starting the 1st dose of Kesimpta this friday: I got diagnosed with RRMS in April end. I've picked Kesimpta as my DMT and having my first injection on friday. For the first one, I'm going to the clinic where they will train me on how to do the self-injection. I'm done with my vaccines (Hepatitis-B, Shingles & Pneumonia). Going forward, is there anything I should know or I should do?"
7831,I guess well just ignore all the infants who pass away from RSV every year: My son was born in May and ended up with RSV at 3 weeks old. It was so scary and so painful to see him that sick when he was just a tiny fragile little dude. He was not hospitalized outside of the initial ER visit thankfully but had to be medicated with a mask and nebulizer every couple hours. The mask basically covered his whole face except the eyes even the child sizes were not small enough. Number 2 is due out of season as well but I Am so grateful there is a vaccine available now that was not when he was born My dr has already given the okay for me to get it at the end of my pregnancy out of an abundance of caution. Its wild to me that people like your SIL are just willing to gamble with their newborns lives like that.
7835,Put me out of my misery.: I got those a couple of years ago. I just had extreme soreness in the area of the shot but that was the only side effect. It lasted a couple of days. Whatever the side effects it is better than shingles for sure. My MIL had a bout of those she described it as feeling like her skin was on fire.

7839,Exposing Covid Vaccine Trials  Shane Smith Has Questions w Brianne Dressen: Every vaccine comes with risks. A very small percentage of COVID vaccine recipients had lasting negative effects. The vast majority get nothing more than a sore arm for a few days. Medical research and doctors always assess risk vs benefit.
7840,Just diagnosed today: I had shingles when I was 21 24 and 27 then I got the vaccine and I just had my first case again at 36. I highly recommend the vaccine my pain is really low compared to what I hear it should be like for a face infection.
7847,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: Three Covid flu and shingles. I was down for 4 days. Going forward Ill only get two at once.
7851,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never went to one of these parties but my mom did try to give me chickenpox as a kid. She would make sure to let me play with my cousins when they had them. I never got it though so I do remember getting the vaccine. I have actually gotten it 3 times because apparently my body does not hold lifelong immunity to it like most people do after 2 doses.
7853,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not remember if there was a particular party or whatever but I do remember that me and two of my cousins had chicken pox at the same time. We might have been shipped to a specific house once we got the pox or maybe we got shipped together to make it all happen. I had the pox around age 7. I had shingles at age 12. Got my two Shingrex shots in the past 12 mos.

I had 13 shingles blisters on my trunk that looked like a bug bite. It was mosquito season so that is what I thought they were. And some might have been As a kid my chicken pox was light only a scattering of blisters also on my trunk. My mom did not think it was chicken pox so I have a few scars from the scratching.
7876,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I have had both doses, about 3 months apart. Really didn't have any side effects, maybe a little fatigue the next day. Given what I'd heard, I was expecting it to be much worse and so was pleasantly surprised."
7883,Progression Photos  Day 9?: I do not know much about scarring but mine seems to be healing BUT I got a secondary infection so I do not know where my shingles ends and where my new infectioncelulitis begins. Make sure to get a follow up to make sure things are healing properly.
7888,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had shingles when I was 21. I worked at a preschool that had an outbreak of chickenpox. My mom told me I had chickenpox when I was 2. I thought I was safe. It was one of the worst times in my life. The pain was unbearable. My PCP told me you can get it more than once. Figures
7889,"Paranoid about shingles: I'm in my 30s and had chickenpox before the childhood vaccine came out. I've been on Ocrevus since 2021. Because of the herpes risk side effects of Ocrevus, I'm scared about developing shingles. Brought it up with neuro PA and she was dismissive about it and about me getting the non-live vaccine. Any thoughts or experiences?"

Biological Father alive age 68 says no known family problems. NonDiabetic Surgeries Gall Bladder Removal Gastric Sleeve I know ya'll hate ones that start like this sorry The pain started about 34 weeks ago as numbness in my feet that slowly progressed to my hands it got noticably worse every day. It does not feel like my neuralgia which is very electric this is distinctly a burning pain. My hands and feet have also become very weak with tremors I have fallen many times often unable to get up without help or crawling to a piece of furniture. I tried everything I could think of to stop the pain Epsom salt baths hotcold voltaren gel alternating ibuprofen and aspirin 800 Mgs of Motrin the ketamine did not effect the pain a foot massager lidocaine none of it worked and by the 23rd of December I was desperate to not ruin my 6yo daughters Christmas stuck waiting in an ER so I decided to try Kratom again I had used it before but it never did anything for me it was my Hail Mary. My husband asked them what was best for pain and they recommended Zaza. So I took two The dose I would started with the last time I tried Kratom and said I would give it an hour to work if not I would give up and we would go to the ER. And holy shit It actually worked it is a Christmas Miracle The relief in those moments as it kicked in was indescribable. I got to have Christmas at least I know many of you did not and were at work instead of home for our benefit and it is greatly appreciated. New Symptoms Difficulty Swallowing No AppetiteFood Aversion Super Dry Mouth At some point on December 28 I was musing about this Zaza Kratom it worked amazingly well for me why have I never heard of it before in my chronic pain groups before etc? So out of curiosity I googled it. Zaza is NOT Kratom I stupidly assumed it was the strain of leaf and never thought to check until then. Zaza is an antidepressant called Tianeptine used in the UK in small doses like 7.5mg. I checked my bottle of Kratom and sure enough in tiny letters on the back it said 700mg Tianeptine...and I would been taking two of them every few hours because I was going off the assumption that it was KRATOM. It is nickname is Gas Station Heroin by the way cute I called poison control pretty much knowing what they would say ER off we went my previous dose had worn off by then. At the ER I was shaking unable to walk or put any pressure on my hands or feet the burning sensation was the worst it had ever been yet it was hard to think or talk. I was a terrible advocate for myself and my husband was busy with our daughter. I know they asked my height and weight but looking back I wanted to add it stands out is they did not ask my history or what medications I was on I am guessing you can see that on your computers while you talk to pts? They placed an IV drew blood they gave oral Norco no relief then IV Toradol labs came back with magnesium .1 low but they hung a bag anyway no change next up Decadron the burn in the barely even rated against this relentless burning.While they had been administering all the different drugs they had been asking questions mostly Are you Diabetic but they no one ever physically examined my hands or feet checked my strength and at this point I was just trying to disassociate from the pain. I mentioned the Kratom mix up and my decreasing ability to swallow but whoever I asked brought me some water and a whole new set of nurses coming through shift change? All I saw thought or heard was pain the Zaza and swallowing just got lost in my head and in the shuffle. I also vomited a few times just water. So my blood pressure jumped to 250111 finally they ordered morphine always works it is like the original mascot of pain meds I was so ready for the agony to end when I had gall attacks morphine always meant I could finally rest but guess what ya'll? No change My heart sank. I just kept thinking I cannot live like this my world has just totally been totally upended. I cannot walk using my phone is agony my daughter is afraid to touch me. They diagnosed me with peripheral neuropathy gave me a prescription for ten 5mg Percocet and a referral to a neurologist. I was wheeled out to car and with my husband's help managed to crawl people were staring because I was screaming trying to twist myself into the seat they probably thought I was being assaulted. I cried my way to CVS already pretty sure what I suspected was true and it was the Percocets did nothing. I got and appointment with a neurologist on the 22nd.I started crying I cannot wait that long for a little hope. I cannot live like this. Over the last few days I have been doing the same as before 2 Zaza pills every 3ish hours. At least it makes me nod out. I also have not been able keep down any food solid or liquid since the 28th and as of this morning swallowing even water has become very difficult and I often vomit the water back and get a kind of heart fluttery feeling after. I have also been itchy this entire time if that is a clue. I need help with literally everything and just walking to the bathroom requires my husband's balance and lots of screaming in pain. These stupid pills are the only thing standing between me and the burning. Gates of Hell. But I think they are poisoning me. I have started having mild aural and visual hallucinations. So I am back at the ER. What should I ask my doctor? Do you think peripheral neuropathy? Should I keep taking the pills? Is the any relief from this? What are your overall thoughts on my situation? Just please help
7894,Just found out last Friday that what I thought was a simple muscle strain was in fact shingles. I Am 51 years old and have not yet had the vaccine. This is my first time experiencing it and I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I had what felt like a muscle pull right below my left shoulder blade on day 6 I started to experience the rash in a small band across my left nipple and two quarter sized spots under my left armpit and under my left shoulder blade exactly where I feel the back pain. Day 7 was excruciating for my back and heart felt like someone stabbing me in the back repeatedly with a pool cue while having my heart in a steel bear trap being pounded on with a hammer. It was terrifying thought I was legit having a heart attack. Doctor put me on Valtrex one week ago with a small supply of norcos to relieve pain. Its been three weeks since I felt the first back pain and I Am left to wonder when the discomfort might start to subside? The back pain is more discomfort than pain now I feel it when I inhale and it seems to flare up at night which has been giving me insomnia a very rare thing for me. The rash which was blistery and disgusting has finally scabbed over. Since tomorrow marks three weeks since the first back pain when might I expect it to go away entirely?
7895,I took the Gardasil 9 vaccine but engaged in sexual activity with a woman of unknown status within 36 hours of taking the vaccine. Does the HPV vaccine offer me any protection in this case ? Or would I likely have contracted HPV from the encounter if the partner already had HPV ?
7897,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had a weak reaction with my 1st shot. The 2nd shot knocked my on my rear for 3 days.
7900,Shingles and other Vaccines: A little story about my grandmother that might help. She had lymphoma that wound up recurring 3 times. She went through all the treatments chemo ports blood transfusions spinal taps you name it. Very strong woman and did not complain about any of it even when she was so sick from treatments. One of the meds caused her to get shingles. She told me that she would not wish shingles upon her worst enemy and it was the worst pain she had out of everything she went through. And she went through a LOT. I am the worlds biggest chicken when it comes to needles and shots. I Am planning on getting my shingles vaccine because I know she would not have ever told me how miserable she was unless she was in excruciating pain. I will never forget it and I am also dreading the vaccine as I heard it is not an easy one for a lot of people. You Have got this Plan for a couple of days of feeling crummymaybe stock up on some favorite snacks books showsthen if you do not feel crummy it will be an added bonus Reward yourself with your treat for being brave. That Is what I plan on doing. I also guess we should be thankful that they now have the vaccine since it was not even out yet when my grandmother was sick.

7930,My son is 4 36lbs and 42 tall. He started vomiting last night and has a low grade fever today. This evening he developed these spots on his left flank region. He has been feeling unwell since yesterday and today complains of headache and feeling terrible mom all day. He has had all his routine vaccines were Canadian including varicella at age 18 months and at age 4 May 2024. My spouse currently has an active shingles outbreak with multiple areas. Hes on day 5 with some blisters still formed and some crusted over. I Am wondering what the likelihood of this being chickenpox is. I Have never seen chickenpox in real life as my all my kids are vaccinated and none of our friends kids have ever had them either. Will post photo in comments because it will not allow me to attach a photo to the main post.
7931,I got shingles on my mons pubisI guess its rare?: Yep And was positive for Covid 1022. The rash started a few days later. I hear people have been getting shingles after Covid infections lately since the immune system is down. I usually have really good skin and no skin problems or sensitivities so this is definitely weird for me.
7932,Second Covid infection halted my recovery: I started to have serious GI issues after the February virus. Which was not one of the many symptoms I had after the first one
7935,Anyone else developed sensitive skin from Covid?: Like just my torso area. Clothing or anything rubbing against me irritates my skin. Almost kinda hurts. No rash or redness though. I'm 4 days in since I texted positive
7943,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Mine got it at 4 months. Only one night in the ER but that was enough. I wish our doc had it in time for RSV season. If it was me Id get it. They can still get RSV and be really sick when they are older than 4 months its just less likely.
7946,So a 4 months back I was completely blindsided by and suffered my first shingles outbreak at 26. It was about 2 inches above and to the right of my butt crack. At first I thought I had a bug bite it quickly started developing into something else. I was out of town but went to doc and got valocyclovir about 4 days into my rash. 4 months later I started to tell my fianc that I thought I had a bug bite and as soon as the words left my mouth my stomach dropped. Thank god I have the meds and I also have terrasil shingles ointment so I Am hoping it goes away. I did notice in retrospect that I was experiencing tinglingnumbness shooting down my legs when doing one legged exercises but I Have had it in some form since my first rash although definitely has gotten worse. It is in the EXACT same spot as last time. Is this yalls experience? Also since I Have taken the meds before its even blistered fully just see a few small bumps forming will it ever fully form? How long does it take to go away in your experience if you start the meds right away? Its about the size of a quarter and it never really got bigger than that last time just super painful because it was fully blistered and I was in a tropical climate terrible. Let me know your experiences Thank you
7947,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was never subjected to a chickenpox party but did get it when I was a toddler. And had my first shingles outbreak at 31. Worst painsickness I have ever experienced in my life and I was told by my PCP that the shingles vaccine does not actually prevent outbreaks.. it just lessens the pain and length of the outbreak.
7948,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Life is hard and I experienced suffering. Are my parents the assholes???? Average reddit post
7949,Could I have shingles?: does not look like shingles to me. For me it started off with a tingling sensation that felt like burning not long after. Then blisters quickly formed. Have you been vaccinated against chicken pox? The coworker would also have had to be rubbing up against you or have had his blister fluid leak.
7950,"Under 50 Shingles Vaccine Question: The pharmacist is unaware of the indications. In my country: SHINGRIX is a vaccine indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) (shingles): * in adults aged 50 years and older. * in adults aged 18 years and older who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. Just something to keep in mind, if you have not had PCR-confirmed zoster, you may be having outbreaks of herpes simplex. This is almost certain to be the case if in the same dermatome."

7959,"Ramsay Hunt syndrome - Worse Pain I Have Ever Felt - It's Driving Me Crazy: I have to recommend a tooth numbing gel or sensodyn type toothpaste for oral pain. It was the only way I could manage to rest or eat or drink. Otherwise, I'm so sorry. Mine felt like cactus spines in my arm and a burn where the blisters were. I'm still feeling insane itching at times where my blister scars are."
7960,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I am in my late 40's had shingles and was eligible for the shot because I am considered immune compromised. If she is got any chronic conditions that counts for shingles according to the CDC.
7962,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Thank you so much for the support I totally agree hot showers have been shockingly relieving My itching has been pretty minimal for the most part so far. The most itchiness I have dealt with was when I first used topical lidocaine but it is been fine since then I bought calamine lotion to hopefully prevent itching when that stage comes and to also help dry out the blisters a bit
7964,Shingles vaccine: I had 24 hour commute when I got shingles and it was right over my shoulder and down my pec where seatbelt goes. I lasted one day then cut open all the pustules and scrubbed them out with peroxide and isopropyl. Terrible scar but at least the deep searing pain went away. Ill gladly trade a few days feeling rough to never have to deal with that shit again.
7965,"Second Shingles Shot: I'm getting my first one tomorrow and am nervous I'm going to feel like crap. Really hoping it turns out like it did for you, OP. :)"
7974,I had a dream my vision was getting blurry so I went to the ophthalmologist to see what the problem was. They did a physical exam of my eyes said there was something wrong with my cornea that I had shingles IN my cornea. So I went on a google search about it after I woke up from my dream. Shingles in your cornea can happen. I had no idea that was even a thing. I was vaccinated for chickenpox when I was little. I have not had chickenpox ever. I do not have shingles. I have no idea why my brain just randomly decided to accurately info drop about something that does not pertain to me lmao
7975,I also have a very strong local reaction to the shingles vaccine. As a result I choose to deal with them one at a time.
7976,Shingles vaccine: Really? I have had both shingle vaccines and multiple Covid vaccines and never got sick. The only vaccine that has ever made me feel a little bad was Pneumonia. I guess I am just lucky.
7978,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the vaccine but still got it too. I think it was only something like 80 efficacy...but at least the vaccine made it weaker than if I was not vaccinated.
7980,RSV vaccine: I would get the RSV vaccine yourself. I just had it a month ago while in the third trimester and it was terrible. I was sick for 3 weeks. Protect yourself as well as your baby. Edited to clarify that I got actual RSV. I have not been able to get the vaccine yet because my midwife wanted to make sure I was fully recovered.
7982,Pediatric Herpes Zoster and PHN..: I first had facescalp shingles eleven years ago and since then have had multiple relapses all facescalp. This March I got the headaches again and knew it was shingles but my primary care said not and would not prescribe antivirals. Within a week I started losing strength and feeling in my torso causing me to lose my balance. I ended up on a walker. I went to various specialists who ruled out inner ear balance issues spinal issues you name it. When Ramsay Hunt Syndrome gave me droops on the right side of my face and trashed my vision my ophthalmologist finally gave me valacyclovir. That stopped the Ramsay Hunt and cleared my vision. But my torso was numb for a couple of months and I had to work on walking upright to get my mobility back. All of this is to say just because it is not shingles with a rash does not mean that shingles is not blasting your nervous system with whatever wild hair it has going on that day. I am not entirely back to normal what with nerves firing randomly in my back and my breast just Ow. A fellow suffering Redditor posted the same condition a few months ago so I am not alone in this. Neither are you. Good luck and I hope you get some relief and some real answers. Info on shingles in the medical world is in my experience little and late.
7987,So I knew having a baby in the nursery it is like having a breeding ground for viruses. But damn it is hit me hard this autumn. Sinus infection throat infection and now shingles.. So the one thing I can count on at the moment is that if it is serious my blood sugar will stay very high no matter what I eat.. So on Friday this was looking at another throat infection but I did not get a fever so did not call the GP.. What do you guys eat when you are sick like this? I am now crying because my nearly 17 months old is going to get chickenpox on Christmas day because they do not routinely vaccinate children for chickenpox here
7988,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: I am also in Ontario and our 7 month old received the RSV vaccine just yesterday. The doctor told us they had just received the vaccine shipment yesterday morning and my little girl was the first dose to be administered  she was scheduled for a flu shot and it happened to be there. Maybe your doctors office had not yet received their doses?
7990,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: In August 2020 I found a lump on the right side of my neck. Turns out to be a squamous cell carcinoma in my right tonsil that spread to three other lymph nodes before treatment could start. A year later after radiation therapy and immunotherapy one lymph node was still lighting up the contrast CT scan. A neck resection of all lymph nodes on the right side of my neck was done. That was a six hour surgery with 10 days of recovery in a hospital unit until the drains in my neck ran clear. Now I have got a fun scar permanent dry mouth concentrated radiation does a number on your salivary glands eating takes a long time and I have regular checkups to make sure the cancer has not returned. All because I enjoy oral sex which is leading to a epidemic of head and neck cancer predominantly in men. If you can get the vaccine do it. If you can help a child get the vaccine do it.
7991,RSV vaccine Abryso because: I got it yesterday. It is just another vaccine really My arm is less sore today than after the TDAP. That is nice your medical covers it mine did not so it was 285.

7993,Is keeping the cervix really a big cancer risk if you have received the Gardasil vaccine are HPV negative and have never had an abnormal pap smear?: I decided to keep my cervix but nothing else also. For some reason I get dysphoric thinking about having a cuff and I am worried about tearing also. I know the dysphoria makes no sense but its there. My brain equates my cervix to a prostate even though I know they are literally nothing alike.
7994,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Just got my second dose of the vaccine this past Friday. I feel much better having done it.
7995,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: chicken pox parties were a real thing ... had a very mild case at about 6 .... fast Forward to 2006 3rd trimester pregnancy 22 years old out of nowhere and they hurt like a lot. I managed but was very uncomfortable. They popped up again spring of 2010 3rd pregnancy 1st trimester. I basically lived in oatmeal baths And a 3rd time in 2017 but only a mild case. I thought I may have had another small outbreak a couple of years ago in the summer but could have also been poison ivy
7997,Shingles: When it was on my back I did have it looked at twice. The first time I was in the hospital and they did not know what it was for 4 days. She put me on a daily dose of Valcycliver after the 4th time. I would have prayed it to be anything else. Each time it lasted 2 to 4 weeks and I have some nerve damage. If the picture posts it was how I looked when I was released from the hospital
7999,The 2nd dose of shingles took me down. I believe it is worth it. I had a friend with shingles. It was heartbreaking
8000,Shingles vaccine: Shingles in my 60s horrific I developed ocular herpes and it was extremely painful. I Have had the vaccines and Ill get any updates.
8002,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: because with the fullness and tinnitus I could not really hear anything The reason you cannot hear anything is due to hearing loss. Fullness and tinnitus are symptoms of hearing loss not the because of it. It absolutely sounds like Meniere's disease or a syndrome of innerear inflammation likely exacerbated or triggered by the vaccine. Could have a viralautoimmunity component.
8003,How long does metotrexate take to work?: Methotrexate does not help everyone. Some people cannot tolerate the side effects well or the medication simply does not work for your specific conditions. Every persons genetics are different so results may actually vary from person to person. If its not helping you speak up to your doctor. Personally I felt some small benefit after week 5 however due to lack of a shingles vaccination at week 6 I had developed life threatening shingles covering 20 of my body entire left arm and left chest and left shoulder. I had to stop methotrexate when I was admitted to the hospital for 11 days. I retried methotrexate almost 1 year later at the rheumatology clinics urging. It did absolutely nothing but horrible things for me after week 10 bleeding gums hallucinationlike dreams gastric distress. Your mileage may vary.
8008,XPost from rpregnant RSV Vaccine in utero or for infants Advice Needed: RSVP is seasonal like the flu so there is extremely low risk out of season its honestly mostly just bad luck that your first daughter got it in July. Your baby will definitely be eligible for the shot since she will be under 8 months when the season starts so that is something you can count on. Editing to add I have a July baby and we got the Beyfortus shot for her during the fall no problem.
8009,By the way that autoimmune disorder was caused by the shingles shot in 2010 People wonder why I am anti vaccine ? Did not used to be? But I will never touch another one of these modern poison shots again
8012,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yep. Shot burned like hell going in but it went away in like 5 minutes. Much better than shingles.
8019,I was diagnosed with severe dysmotility of my GI tract back in 2021 GES and SmartPill as well as dysautonomia which seemed to come on really bad 2 months after I had a shingles outbreak I am now 34F but at the time I was 29 and had them on my hands so unfortunately the doctors did not realize it was shingles...I am currently going through my 2nd bout of shingles I have no immune system and take all of the preventative vaccines but unfortunately they never told merecommended the shingles vaccine . Unfortunately I was not able to get the antiviral medication in time so I am really hoping that I do not experience and bad complications after this I had to go on a GJ tube back in 2021 and it was removed last year because it had disintegrated so badly it started eroding my stomach so now it will have to be a J tube if I have to go back on it. Thankfully for the last year I was able to manage my weight albeit I am not on any meds for my Crohn's currently because they seem to exacerbate the dysmotility symptoms that is going to be a July issue when I see my GI next. I Am curious about the possible implication of shingles worsening my dysmotility since my doctors now know my dysmotility started back when I was 1516 yo from imaging studies they had performed but at the time they thought it was scar tissue thar was closing off my intestine dysmotility was never even imagined. They even eventually got the scope to the area that they thought was obstructed intended to use a balloon to open it up because it was either that or resection of my bowel which I had actually consulted with the surgeon for and when they reached the site there was absolutely no sign of scar tissue by this time I was in my 20s early 2010s and the GI tried to tell me my body had healed itself to the point of there being absolutely no scar tissue with Imuran which is a very harsh drug and would not have that effect I have a PhD in neuroscience for the degree of scar tissue they believed was blocking my intestine it would never be able to heal to the point of having no evidence of any scar tissue ever being there. Plus I continued to experience pain and other symptoms but my GI brushed it all off and said I was fine not an uncommon story here...and even then the blocked area of my small intestine still appeared on every imaging study but they never did anything to investigate why. Cut to 2019 getting shingles and them taking 2 years to finally decide that it was not just the Imuran mimicking a Crohn's flare I switched to Entyvio infusions since based on the clinical studies it had the less nauseavomiting adverse events than the other medications but I continued to still have the same issues and lost weight until I was under 100 lbs and needed the feeding tube to help me get to a healthy weight. I am curious though has anyone else experienced shingles and then either developed or had further complications with either their autonomic nervous system dysfunction or GPdysmotility? I would be very interested to hear if there is any connection there for anyone who has experienced shingles I am so sorry Being my second time this time with it wrapping around my entire right side of my torso I understand the immense pain you have had to deal with...I encourage anyone and everyone at this point to get the vaccine if they are in anyway susceptible because when they say painful think 247 nonstop nerves on fire pain.
8022,Put me out of my misery.: I had shingles at the age of 45. You do not want it. It was my worst ever pain and I Have had a testicular torsion.
8026,Shingles vaccine experience: You made the right decision trust me. Since turning 50 the shingles vaccine was always on my radar but as a mom wife and caregiver to my disabled sister I just never made it a priority. Then shingles found me. I know that each individual experience is different with varying degrees of similarity but honestly I Have never experienced anything so profoundly painful in my life. Mind you I had it for a week before I figured out what it was. I was helping my husband with last minute preparations for a Spring Break trip to Legoland this year and that whole week 2 things kept happening a I would wake up as though someone had hit me in the spine with a hammer and b I itched like crazy. Neither of these things raised a red flag for me as we lived in Florida and bugs bite all year long there and I have some bulging discs in my back that will often trigger pain elsewhere along the path. But that Friday something went off in my brain and sent me to the urgent care. They tested my rash and sure enough it was shingles. The next day I woke up with an intense all over body ache bad description as this pain was sharp and intense but never let up. I had a fever of 103.2 and the pain was so intense that it was like being hit with a giant mace that impacted my whole body. I cried myself to sleep for 3 days. By day 10 everything went back to normal but man oh man if I could do it all over again Id gladly would have gotten the vaccine.
8027,Hi so last week I 29 woman started getting some very nasty and painful blisters around my mouth eye scalp and cheekbones ALL on the right side of my face. At first there was nothing just my skin itching. Then small bumps appeared then blister chest tightness and intense pain on my face. Anyway eventually I went to the emergency and the doctor there told me it was shingles but because it was affecting my right eye I had to see an ophtalmologist. The ophtalmologist told me it was herpes. I am currently waiting for the results to know which one it is while the antivirals that were prescribed to me are finally starting to work. That being said I wanted to know if anybody else ever experience shingles all over one side of their face. Because the ophtalmologiste told me that it cannot be shingles because it was affecting more than 1 area of my face but this does not make sense with what I have been reading online. Or maybe I am just in denial who knows.
8031,Shingles vac: Get Shin gri x before starting Aza thi opr in e if possible. I got Shingles after starting Aza thi opr in e at it absolutely sucks. After that I got Shin gri x as fast as possible. Apparently Aza thi opr in e and 6 MP Us tek in uma b St elara and the JAK inhibitors are particularly bad for virus infections which Shingles is a re occurrence of.
8041,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Not here to provide medical advice but I became symptomatic during a 3night cram session for college and shingles sucks. Even at 20. I still deal with it.
8046,No matter how bad the pain from the shingles shot is and it is bad it is a picnic compared to shingles. I got shingles in my early 40s and luckily caught it early enough for antivirals. I thought I had appendicitis the pain was so bad.
8048,Just before my 44 th birthday I got the worst headache in my entire life. I thought at first it was a return of my childhood migraines I outgrew but it entered a second day then a third then a fourth. thought a tumor must have exploded in my brain and I would die shortly. Physicians were puzzled and threw a bunch of different prescriptions at me but nothing work. End of Day 4 the rash appeared. Shingles. I was stunned. I thought Shingles was something only the elderly or immuno suppressed would get? I had Chicken Pox old school from a bathtub party in ' 84 thought I was immune? Eventually I see Ophthalmologist to get my eye checked out and he repeats what I thought when I was in medical school a healthy 44 year old getting shingles was a rare event and often suggested an undiagnosed cancer but ever since the varicella vaccine it is a common diagnosis. I was skeptical but then a friend of mine who emigrated from the UK around a decade ago tells me Mate that is why we do not give kids the pox shot back home so the adults still get exposed and have latent immunity built up. I google it and sure enough that is true. What are your thoughts? Did the US make a well intention ed mistake? Does anyone have incidence rate data comparing US to UK?
8049,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I was not vaccinated. I got shingles in my faceeye. Took 13 weeks to recover only for shingles to come back in my eye. Had to restart antibiotics and 8 weeks of eye drops. I finally got the all clear. I am now vaccinated.
8051,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: You should really consider getting the vaccine. I had the shingles before I was 50 and it hurt really bad.
8054,What are the facts around shedding? I had a colleague who developed shingles a few months after the Covid treatments were released. His Dr. asked him if he had been around anyone recently vaccinated. Was that a legitimate pattern that was seen?
8061,Put me out of my misery.: I am sorry both shots just about did you in. Thankfully I just got injection site soreness but I was prepared for the worst because I watched my mom battle shingles twice and my neighbor little old lady whose breakout I would put calamine lotion on for her. I can handle feeling like shit a couple of days I want none of the actual singles.
8066,Have patient who wishes she had gotten the vaccine vs the shingles she is enduring now on week3
8070,Sick after first dose. Please help: It probably was the drug. I know there were side effects in small of people but I do not generally get side effects and I figured Id just tough through it if it happened. But it hit me like a truck exactly 40 minutes after taking it. Worst flu symptoms I Have ever had and I Am in my 60s so I Have had a few. I nearly went to the hospital it was so bad. Now the next morning its like a bad hangover.
8074,Humira gave me shingles: Thanks for clarifying yes I am very aware of this I edited the original post as my concern is that having the shingles virus reactivate in a significantextensive rash is not normal for a otherwise health 29 year old. I am 100 certain it was reactivated as my immune system is suppressed from the Humira.
8075,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Get it. Beyfortus was not around when mine got discharged but both my twins got synagis which is the antibody shot they did before beyfortus. Zero side effects and they got it 24 hours before we left which gave me some peace knowing they were in the best place if there was a reaction. They are now 2 but qualified for one more round of RSV shots and got beyfortus this year with no issues.
8077,Hi I Am a Healthy adult 42 never had this shingle problem now just started 1 week after stressful week of my daughter surgery. Very painful and I Am getting them more and more increasingly everyday doc only gave me ani viral medicines is there another way to cure them fast ? So much pain does anyone know how long does it take or any other way to stop them like vaccine please advise. Any home remedies please share?
8078,I am almost 4 weeks out from me shingles outbreak on the front right side scalp and face. I still have scabbing and wounds on my scalp. I am suffering from postherpetic itch. I am also a picker and the itching is driving me insane. I have balding in spots from scratching. All my family Doctor has done so far is to keep jacking up my lyrica. As of Monday I have also developed a lung infection and my sinuses are blocked. My doctor figured I picked up something as I am always immunocompromised due to RA medication and other stuff. He figures the shingles bottomed out my immune system. Something is driving me insane. I can feel a perfectly straight line of small bumps connecting one scab to another. Am I going crazy because I have taken 100s of photos and this one is the only one that I can pick up on camera. I have it cropped and marked. The bumps are flesh color and almost under the skin but I can fell them as I run my fingers across my scalp. They are one of the major sources of itch. Ok wondering if this could be a nerve path? Can anyone else make it out? It is the photo with the black lines on it. Anyways good luck to anyone battling shingles. It sucks As we all know. Cheers and Happy New Year. PS my hair is a state because I am trying different lotions and creams to try and tackle this god awful itching.
8081,Shingles vaccine: First shot was not bad. Flu like symptoms after the second. Just make sure you do not get it before something important. Shingles is awful and can leave you with a lot of after effects. Its worth it
8085,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Both shots had me down for the count for just over 2 days with the symptoms you've described.
8087,Shingles vaccine?: My neighbor got shingles recently and had the vaccine over a year ago. She had a really rough time.
8088,Rashes on body after seeing girlfriend: Does she have a cat/dog?
8089,57yo female recently recovered from flulike illness prior to itchy and painful rash appearing on chest approx. 3 day duration as of January 3. Residual dry cough. There appears to be some seepage and slight indentations within several of the lesions. Had chickenpox as a child no shingles vaccine.
8091,Hospital denied HPV and Hep vaccination: And helps protect against anal cancer. Not easily treated and often not found early. My friend female had a colposcopy test recently and was waiting for the results and they called wanting a follow up phone appointment which obviously was needed wracking. She is hpv positive but nothing was pre cancerous yet so she is hoping her body clears it but if not just needs to monitor more closely. I think you should do what you said and do research to get someone over there who will give it to you.
8095,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: When I had shingles all I wanted to do for the first 10 days was sleep
8096,28 Female United States White if it matters Overweight TLDR at the bottom I Have struggled with shingles since I was in prek. In my early years it was treated as ring worm and then when I was 21 I had moved and got new doctors. They were shocked I had been treated for ring worm so many times when it was clearly shingles. It usually started on my chin and has gotten bigger each break out eventually reaching my ears. This time it was exclusively in my ear. I Have been dealing with this specific break out for over a month now. Initially it was treated as swimmers ear outer ear infection. And then I woke up yesterday I was in the worst pain I Have ever been in my entire life. It was hard to close my eye and I could not chew. I could not hear anything still cannot in that ear. I went to urgent care and they treated me for outer ear but suggested it could potentially be Ramsay Hunt. I could not take the pain anymore and went to the ER last night and they confirmed it was shingles. Steroids and pain meds the medicine that starts with a V for shingles. I forgot. Sorry. But it left me with more questions. Why has no one offered the shingles vaccine and they do not necessarily want to give it to me? It kind of gets brushed off when I ask. What causes the break outs and why has it potentially gotten exclusively to my ear? How can I prevent this? I Have noticed sunburn is a trigger but I Have not been in the sun. I have an appointment with ENT but they do not have any availability until 731. Any information you can give me would be extremely EXTREMELY helpful. TLDR. Have struggled with shingles on my face my entire 28 years life and now its exclusively in my ear. Can I have the vaccine? What Is your advice?
8097,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You can still get shingles from the vaccine that is what happened to me . Also you can still get the shingles vaccine but you will probably have to pay out of pocket. Do it anyways its so worth it I got my vaccine after my second outbreak and have not had anymore.
8098,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: She could notcannot get the shingles vaccine yet.
8101,Just heading off for second shingles vaccine Very much not looking forward to this one. Never had a vaccination knock me around so badly.
8103,Shingles vaccine: I caught a mild case of shingles at like 45 or so. It was hellacious. And it was a mild case across my lower back. I could not even imagine having it somewhere like on my face. I cannot stress enough that you do not want shingles.
8104,I was happy for the truck because I actually got shingles. Shingles was the whole damn train. Glad you got the vaccine.
8106,Second Shingles Shot: As someone who currently has shinglesTHIS IS HELL Do not worry about the side effects from the vaccine. Just take them. There is no way they are as bad as the mysery I am going through right now. I wish I had taken it before this. I am 48 m.
8108,I did the same three days ago. Minimal soreness and no side effects. The shingles vaccine is another story but its still way better than getting shingles. Thanks
8109,I am sorry. Hit me the same way. But I had shingles twice prior to the vaccine and that was much worse. Hang in there
8111,Shingles vaccine: I was fortunate in that I had no side effects with either dose. My friends who did were in bed feeling miserable for about 24 hrs.
8112,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: Thank you for the good wishes Nope this is actually my 5th go round on this shitty carousel The last outbreak a few weeks ago was my first since my Shingrix series 3 years ago. 3rd time was horrible burned my second and last for that year week of vacation on it draped over the arm of my recliner so nothing would touch my blisters. Had them from the midline of my front all the way around my right ribcage to the middle of my back right where my bra band goes. I did not want anything touching me while I was awake but at night the opposite was true I learned that the best way to sleep was laying on that side with a medicine ball on top of the convers to make sure I could not roll over in my sleep but also to keep everything unmoving while I slept. I am still popping gabapentin like candy since I have got PHN where the worst blister was just beside my spine. The 4th time was fairly mild as it did not really rub that much but this time I cannot help but rub it when I am wiping and when I went after work earlier the wet wipe was red. At least I am on vacation next week so I can try to rest up and heal. All this has exacerbated my MS symptoms so my body is NOT a happy camper.
8113,Burning pain but not severe: Mine kept coming out about a week to 10 days after it started. My rash was just itchy at first. My biggest pain area has been the nerve on my right front stomach area. It was really my first sign of shingles but I did not know it. It was numb and tingling. I just kept hoping it would go away. That started about a week before the rash appeared. That area had less rash and was the most painful. Dr recommended cold compresses and anti inflammatories. I am glad you are getting antivirals. I have never heard of side effects of course every med can have them. I think it is the same med people use for cold sores but a higher dose. It is used commonly. Best of luck to you.
8114,Shingles vaccine experience: For me it was about half as bad as an MRNA Covid shot.
8115,Shingles vaccine: I did not have any trouble whatsoever with the shingles vaccine. NONE. I expected to but was willing to do it anyway since seeing what one of my friends experienced by getting shingles. She was in screaming pain for weeks.
8118,Shingles shot reactions?: Ill be getting the shot there is no way it could be as bad as suffering a shingles outbreak. I Have had it for three weeks feels like I Have been in a motorcycle crash then got stung by swarm of hornets those hornets come back every evening and it feels like they bring a friend who is handy with a baseball bat. not exaggerating I Have been in bike crashes rolled through a wasp nest in long grass and been whacked with a bat points of reference established.
8120,Never got sick until I took flu shot some years ago because of autoimmune disease Dr asked if I wanted shingles vaccine because I get them several times a year I told her no I was not taking any vaccines. They have lost all my trust.
8121,It knocked me on my butt and the second dose is worse but I would have 2 more shots if it meant avoiding shingles. That looks like scary stuff.
8122,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles and you do not want it. Get the vaccine. I have now gotten the vaccine now the mild discomfort is nothing compared to the hell that is shingles.
8124,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I somehow got it twice. Second time way worse. Still have scars from it. Every now and then I get what I call preshingles. An area of my skin in typical shingles areas gets hypersensitive and slightly painful. Rarely Ill start to develop rednessbumps but it never progresses to full blown shingles. Otherwise super healthy rarely get sick. Somehow that virus just hits different on me.
8125,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles in 4th grade. It was brutal. Almost went blind. It. Was. BAD.
8126,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I paid out of pocket in Virginia a few years back. I cannot locate that particular transaction but I want to say I was charged somewhere around 150 for the series. Because my insurance would not cover it no clue why I was over 50 the pharmacist checked for discount programs to would help offset the cost. Bless that dude Still not cheap and the side effects were worse than the C covid vaccine vaccines. Still way better than getting shingles.
8127,A roofer with shingles. How ironic: Hard to keep the rash covered it is down the side of my face and eyelid. Each time does it show up in the same area? I am thinking of getting the shingle vaccine when I can. Have you gotten it?
8133,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I fainted a few times in my twenties if I feel dizzy now I quickly go to a knee and put a hand on the ground. We are so ridiculously fragile that you can die from falling over. The first time it happened I came to and was covered in blood from bouncing my head off of a stove.
8134,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: I had shingles at 38 and I am the same. every tingle in that area and I am freaking out. LOL I have about as many more months to go. crying face
8136,"Non-painful, not itchy rash: Nope. I've never had a rash like this. I've had allergic reaction rashes, but those are usually much larger and on my torso, they itch, and aren't this shape."
8138,On December 9th I woke up with a migraine. Not just any migraine but a vestibular migraine. I should have stayed home but I went to work. I had a migraine every day for the next two weeks. We were right in the middle of a huge project launch and since I was going to be off from 122313 I just pushed myself through. On the 23rd I went to urgent care because I could not take the migraine anymore. They gave me a shot of Toradol in my left butt cheek. The next morning I woke up with my left side feeling sore. I felt what I thought was a welt and thought maybe it was an allergic reaction. The day after Christmas I felt more pain and another welt. Then that Friday I noticed a long red line on my side so I went to urgent care. It was shingles. got my antivirals and some calamine lotion and everything was good. The following Monday I felt like I was getting bronchitis so I went back to urgent care. The doctor said my lungs sounded clear but she did do a Covid flu and RSV test. All of them came back normal. She gave me a script for a cough med. That Thursday I could hardly breathe and I was coughing like crazy. I went back to urgent care and the doctor said that I might have pneumonia. I got an xray and the results were that there was concern that I would develop pneumonia so this doctor prescribed augmentin and amoxicillin. This past Sunday I was worse. Gasping for breath and could barely walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without feeling like I was going to pass out. this time I went to the emergency room. they did an xray CT scan bloodwork and did more testing including Covid RSV and flu. Turns out I have RSV. They gave me liquid antibiotics two IVs and a breathing treatment I still am having trouble breathing and coughing but it is not as bad as before however I still feel like crap. My work was closed for 2.5 days so I stayed home the rest of this week too. I forgot to mention I have had diarrhea this entire time and I am getting headaches again. I see my regular doctor on Monday. I do not know that I can work next week if I still feel like this. I have pain on my side from the shingles. I cannot walk without getting winded. My appetite is terrible. I think I have lost 12 lbs since this all started. I have never been so sick in my life.
8139,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Ooof I got shingles when I was only 26. it is pretty brutal. The rash was one thing but even a decade later still hurts.
8140,Shingles vaccine is the only vaccine I ever did have a reaction to. It was difficult.
8142,Anyone take shingles vaccine and experience highs for several days after?
8143,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: Thanks for the reminder. Just scheduled my shot.
8144,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I posted in another sub about this. I scheduled my Shingles vaccine and then got the flu. They would not let me get the vaccine while I had a fever. 7 days later I started having this weird excruciating nerve pain thumping headache and the horrible fatigue from the flu had not subsided. Went to the doctor and she listened to my symptoms gave me a once over and said that she was sure I had Shingles. She said it was rare but not unheard of to have Shingles without presenting with the rash or pustules. I have had 4 full days of the Shingles antiviral medication and the taser like zaps while not gone are less frequent. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain is a 20 and last 3 to 7 seconds. Takes my breath away every single time. Seriously. Do not procrastinate on this Get the vaccine
8147,Shingrix Shingles vaccine not covered by Canada Life: Had the second dose a couple weeks ago. After seeing how much the people I know who had shingles suffered I will absolutely take that feeling any day.
8154,I have had shingles for around a week now and on antivirals for it. The pain is like my leghipbackstomach has intense sunburn along with stabbing and shooting pains down my quad. I run ultra marathons and was wondering if the pains often last long after the infection has gone and if anyone else that runs has any experience of this effecting their running long term?
8159,Hi Not as unusual as you might think given exact same thing happened to me. Needs to be Shingrix though as the other vaccine did not work on my wife to her great agony which she described as a month of worse pain than child birth.
8162,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I cannot comment about the vaccine but I have had shingles a very bad case of shingles It was absolutely the worst most painful thing I have ever had. Not only that the worst of it lasted 9 weeks then months of declining symptoms. At the height of the symptoms nothing less than oxycodone would bring relief. Now about the itching. I had the most intense itching you can imagine. At one point I scratched until I bled and it still itched. Nothing brought great relief to the itching but surprisingly peppermint oil did bring temporary relief. I should point out that not everyone has a severe case as I had but you never know until it is too late. I cannot imagine the vaccine being worse than the case of Shingles I had.
8163,I was considering getting my COVID booster soon and looking at the other available vaccines had me wondering if I should get vaccinated for them or not? I have looked at the available guidelines but it would be helpful to hear outside thoughts about it. I know this does not replace medical advice from my doctor. I have never had a vaccine reaction and in general am very tolerant of vaccines. I think the worst issue I ever had was being slightly sore after my tetanus shot. I am not immunocompromised in any way as far as I am aware although I do have issues with IBS never had a flare up due to vaccines though as far as I have noted. MPOX  I am in veterinary medicine and work with wildlife. I may possibly travel to Africa in the future but it is not definite. HEP B  I got the first and second shot as a child but never got the third shot. HPV  I am in a relationship with my only ever sexual partner and I am their only. I am over 26. I may have children in the future but am unsure. I have recently got my flu shot am planning to get my COVID booster and have completed my other childhood vaccines as a kid Tdap Hib Polio MMR Varicella and Hepatitis A. I have also been vaccinated for rabies tetanus and have had multiple TB tests due to my occupation. If there are any vaccines I have missed I should also consider getting vaccinated for let me know as well
8164,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I loved being covered in itchy puss filled zits for 5 days And the icy dagger of pain up my spine when I was 45 added to my memories of shingles. I am just going to rename it 'snuggles' from now on.
8169,Pediatric Herpes Zoster and PHN..: So I have these back pain incidents every three to six months and have for much of my life. No because just BAM Good morning You cannot get out of bed or poop for the next week Enjoy I Have been saying it was nerve related for YEARS but nobody ever listened. I cannot believe it could date all the way back to childhood shingles but it fits... Who finally diagnosed it? I am seeing a neurologist next week for my shoulder and my back just gave out on the same side...
8171,Abrysvo Vaccine 33 weeks pregnant studies and risks?: First off that sucks. I Am sorry that happened to you and I totally understand your reticence to go out and get a bunch of newly approved vaccines. My understanding of pericarditis is that its associated with both covid infection and covid vaccination This suggests to me at least that its something specific to the immune response to the spike protein itself rather than the vaccine per se. But obviously I do not know that for sure. Now on to RSV. I Am also pregnant and high risk so I Have been doing a lot of research before well anything including this vaccine. I recently decided to get it. Abryso which is the only RSV vaccine approved for pregnant people so if you are not getting it at your OB make sure you get the right one is not an mRNA vaccine. Its a proteinbased vaccine. Maternal side effects of vaccination were sore arm headache and nausea. No pericarditis reported that I could find. Initial studies showed a possibly elevated risk 1 of preterm birth in low and middle income countries more than 30 days after vaccination but the recommended vaccination window was changed and subsequent studies showed a decrease in preterm birth among the vaccinated population nonsignificant. The subsequent study also showed a very slight increased risk for hypertensive disorders including preeclampsia Overall the vaccine is pretty effective. It lowers the risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection for baby by 91 within 90 days after birth and 76.5 180 days after birth. ACOG is recommending vaccination for everyone Anecdotally my OB said she would absolutely chose to get it if she were pregnant and my whole practice actually ran out because so many people were opting in. Sorry this turned out to be more than you asked for but I hope that helps. Best wishes for your pregnancy
8172,I did not have any reaction at all to the shingles vaccine. Lucky I reckon.
8173,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I had shingles a few years ago on my face and across my eyes. It was HORRIBLE I did just get the shingles vaccine earlier than summer. I was down for the count for a few days. But its a zillion times better than actual shingles.
8175,Shingles Vaccine: i got it last year its not particularly painful but was out of commission for three days so be prepared for fever chills body aches etc. i would take tyelnol if these start to rear their head so you do not feel too crappy
8178,33f went to urgent care because of rash turns out its shingles: I enjoy the cold of the calamine it seems the cold temps are the only thing that stops the deep itching burning feeling for me. I did try to take a cold shower but I have the chills as well so that did not go as well as I thought.
8179,Lola living up to her anti social reputation. Had first shingles vaccination today went to bed this afternoon so upset her she left bedroom went to her cat igloo in front room. got up 3 hrs later she heard me gave me a filthy look left the room and went back on the bed
8183,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: If you have ever had shingles it is a drop in the bucket worth it. Years ago I had a tiny patch maybe 2 x 2 and it knocked me out for two months. I cannot imagine the pain of people who get it across their back chest face or ears.
8185,Female 29 history of autoimmune and endometriosis. I have had shingles 3 times in the last 3 years. Once on my side once in my mouth and now on the upper side of my knee. Should I be talking to my doctor about the shingles vaccine even at my age? The first time and this time it is only been a couple of sores. When I had it in my mouth it was slightly worse. The last two occurrences have been within 6 weeks.
8188,Shingles vaccine experience: i know two people who in last 5 years not just got shingles but had long term side effects pain scarring
8189,The shingles vaccine was the one I felt the most. Got my Covid and flu shot yesterday.
8190,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in 1992. When I was in kindergarten in 1997 chicken pox started going around the school. My mom realized what was happening and took me to the doctor for my vaccine right away. About a week later I got chicken pox anyway. So... both for me
8191,I got shingles in ICU and it went in my nipple. At 38 years old. I know it will suck but please go through with the second dose.
8194,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: My mother got the shingles vaccine and she still got shingles. It was also very painful for her. What was so funny is when she told this to the doctor she had been vaccinated they said they had a better vaccine now and offered it to her. Hah a hah a So when she gets shingles again will we have an even better non working vaccine? Obviously she turned it down.
8195,Shingles Sucks: Thank you why does no one talk about the horrific spasms?
8199,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I received my shingles shots and about nine months later actually got shingles. But because of the vaccine it was very minor and lasted a few days and never returned. I can only imagine what it would have been like wout the vaccine.
8200,First Time Head and Neck Only: Oh my goodness. Same to you Hang in there and take it day by day. I pretty much gave up and am now bedridden . I am on day 6 and my rash is on day 3. Rash is starting to really burn and hurt as if everything else was not enough yea um ok shingles. We will get through this though I am going to get the vaccine as soon as I can.
8201,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: Sorry that vaccine really sucks I got the vaccine last spring and got shingles again in the fall.
8206,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Same I smiled so smugly when OP divulged that Weird Hippie Grandma got shingles. But thanks to her little Annie will probably get them someday too. I had a fairly serious case of chicken pox in 4th grade missed three weeks of school and was only spared scars thanks to my moms constant daily diligence. 35 years later I got shingles. In the worst area a woman could have them. It was the most excruciating experience of my life. Hurt more than my two children being born. I ended up in the ER. Ugh. What a witch
8209,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Obligatory caveat IANAD Here Is what I do for the mRNA covid vaccines since I have bad reactions that start within 30 minutes perhaps due to a chemical sensitivity to propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol which I usually do not do well with. I then have the usual immune response that lasts several more days and can be quite rude but of course prefer it to the disease so I have my protocol developed through several rounds of tries 1. Id recommend asking any of your health care providers for a short course of lorazepam for the day or so leading up to the vaccine to help manage the anxiety and not interfere with sleep so you go into it well rested. Or if you have a different benzodiazepine you trust already that is fine too. If you do not have a HCP that will help then do everything from your antianxiety toolkit I keep a written guide for such occasions with varying levels of severity. 2. Then about an hour before the vaccine time take a Benadryl a famotidine and maybe a zofran if you are prone to nausea and a big electrolyte drink. Pack an emesis bag or something that can serve that role like a clean doggie pick up bag it helps me feel more prepared and less anxious. The Benadryl H2 antihistamines will help your mast cells calm the eff down they love getting involved but this is not their show and not make your dysautonomia worse. 3. Stay at the vaccine place for the recommended time but ask to return to your car or someplace that you can recline or at least be able to sit with your legs outstretched even if its outside. I tell the pharmacist or whoevers administering that I promise to check back in before leaving and they are usually fine with this arrangement. 4. Arrange to have someone come with you to drive you home and ideally be there for another hour or so just in case you end up needing to go to urgent care for more support. After that take it easy and see how you feel. 5. Clearing your schedule as much as you can is wise. Have some foods preprepared or easy nutritious prepackaged things around and really push the fluids salt etc. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen or alternate as needed it will not mess with the benefits of the vaccine and will help your body not overreact and get comfortable to rest. Have some showsbooksaudiobooks or whatever ready to go for that first day. Also clear paths in your home to the bathroom kitchen etc in case the dizziness is bad. Want to make it easy to get around. Also get caught up on laundry and any cleaning in advance since you might not be able to for a few days. 6. Continue the ibuprofenacetaminophen in the couple days that follow for any fevers hydrocortisone cream and cold packs for localized rashes and swelling and keep up with hydration. Good luck You can do it
8214,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: 56 yo. I had chix pox as a kid. I got the shingles vaccine. About a year later I got a mild case of shingles. It was mild because I was vaccinated. It still really hurt. Get the shingles vaccine. Trust me.
8219,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: Yes please do not be like me. I just left urgent care and I have the shingles on my face. It is very painful. Plus I look hideous. The doctor put me on an antiviral and steroids.
8222,2nd Bout of Mild Shingles in 3 months but reaction to Valtrex this time?: So it's been worse since you got the vaccine?
8223,I got the shingles shot back in 2015 recommend by my doctor because I had the chicken pox as a adult . Well I got it then came home fell asleep. Woke up I could not get up . Called my doctor next day explained what happen. They did nothing
8226,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Fellow gout victim here. My new doctor just changed my prescription. I am awake and scrolling Reddit right now in the middle of the night because a flare up just kicked in. A week or more of misery to come.
8231,Shingles vaccine: I had some swelling in the glands under my arm but only for a day. My dad had the shingles after abdominal surgery. He said the shingles hurt worse than the operation.
8233,My FTM baby boy turned 2 months old yesterday. Sadly he also started getting sick yesterday. I thought it was just a cold. However I took him to the doctor this morning and he has RSV. He got the RSV vaccine about a month ago and I Am so thankful he did as the doctor said it will help work towards keeping him out of the hospital. Today is day 2. I Have read that it starts to get better around day 56 but at the moment that seems so far out. So I Am looking for any and all advice you have on what worked to was the discomfort for your little ones if you have experienced it. PLEASE no horror stories. I am concerned enough as it is and I Have already been down that hole. Hes EBF and he has not eaten very much today. The most is like 5 minutes at a time when his nursing sessions are usually 10 minutes. I do not want him to get dehydrated so I keep offering but hes very uninterested. What were doing now sitting in the bathroom while steamed up when his breathing seems to be getting rougher humidifier going near us in whatever room were in at all times Zarbees soothing chest rub saline spray  Frida nose sucker keeping him elevated by keeping him on my chest Is there anything else that I can be doing to help my LO? I absolutely hate seeing him like this and feeling so useless.
8234,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I am sorry for what you are going through with your endo surgery long covid and now shingles to add to the fun. I do not think nerve pain only as the rash is clearing means the nerve pain will stay. So I had shingles on my forehead and eye. What I guess was nerve pain was a headache to start with before a rash. As the rash started that went away. Then suddenly after the rash was cleared I had the worst nerve pain possible. Left me in tears. After that any nerve pain was less intense and what I would call shocks. For the most part that is gone and was at its worse from 3 weeks after the first symptom to 4 months. Not sure why I am telling you all that except to point out that every case is at least a little different. For most people the pain of shingles tends to cease between 13 months. 15 people may develop PHN. This is numbness and nerve pain after 3 months. I am sure you have seen the risk factors but they do include a delay in receiving treatment. So based on that alone I would say you are at risk but by no means is that a guarantee. I have PHN. For me however my symptom is mostly numbness that comes and goes with now what is rare nerve pain brief tolerable shocks. I had shingles 9 months ago. Most people with PHN have a much worse experience I think. I may have missed it but are you taking gabapentin. If not I would start there. Eta.. someone mentioned it so in case you do not see it. My doc also recommended lidocaine patches I do not think you are in the US but here they are available over the counter or prescription depending on the strength. Not sure about the UK. I never tried patches though since it was on my face
8236,Like it says on the tin. I was diagnosed with dysautonomia a couple of years ago after two full years of bodywide symptoms. Diagnosis and neuromodulators got it under control then a flu shot gave me a moderate 3week flare. I am in my early 50s so the Shingrix shingles vaccine is strongly recommended. I am terrified that this particular 2part vaccination might because a bad flare because it is a livevirus vaccine that is known to even hit people without dysautonomia pretty hard especially the second shot. Has anyone here had the Shingrix shots? What was your experience? Was the second one much worse? Has anyone here been told by their doctor to not get the shots? Any other thoughts on the matter are also welcome. Thanks for your input
8237,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: that is exactly me I got gardisil and still got hpv went in for my Pap smear and 2 years in a row I had abnormal results one of the less common high risk strains so I had a colposcopy and did the smallest scalpel biopsy in July but they found pre cancer. They said it is nothing alarming so I do not have to treat it yet or anything. So I have to do a Pap smear next year again and if it comes back with still abnormal results I have to get a more painful serious biopsy  hoping everything goes well for you
8243,Boosters and vaccinations: Shingles with Sjogrens is No Joke. Very painful. I personally would get the vaccine.
8245,councilor for anxiety and depression was tuesday next appointment is early July. my living situation is both bad for my health and actively traumatic. I have also had covid twice in the last 4 years shingles and a gallbladder try and kill me too. so no surprise I am having issues. But Jan 2023 I ask the doc about some things and they set a referal to a neurologist for half a year later while giving me a hep b vaccine shot. As I wait the 6 months I develop ocular migraines which started in march 2023 and happened frequently at first but tapered off to 1 a month by the time I saw the Neurologist. I wait half an hour to see him on appointment day. He looks at the file has me touch my nose with eyes closed tests grip says there is some weakness. I mention the new migraines which he dismisses. he sets up a nerve conductance test for a few months later and leaves. test is done a few months later and I am let shown the door and nobody talks to me for a month until I call my primary and a follow up is scheduled a few months later. Where they set up an MRI. That appointment happens later with a panic inducing not about MS. It takes a week to find out that was part of the justification for the test looking for signs of MS. none found. a couple months later I get a follow up where the news is the doctor is leaving and they do not have a replacement yet. He says that it may be just anxiety and poor sleep. then he is gone still never discussed the new migraines. Got a call a month ago to set up a meeting with the temporary replacement nuero for today. I get terrible sleep and it is heat stroke weather but I get there early. He comes in gets my name wrong asks some questions I tell him everything including that I am autistic had poor sleep an no water all day in the broiling heat. Then he says he is frustrated none of the things I said are noted in the file on the computer and the notes that are there are so badly worded that they do not tell him anything useful. Has me touch my nose with my eyes closed and do variants of open and close the clumbsy hand while he fiddles with my dominant hand. Then has me walk down the hall and back. what do you think could be going on? excuse me?... Maybe something hanging on post covid? maybe PTSD making my nerves shot? maybe the mold exposure in my living space? Could be the autistic burnout I have been in? When I first came in your face was flat and you did not move much with your left side to the door. and when you walked down the hall you did not move your arms much. These are all signs of Parkinsons. full phobia of neurodegenerative disorders kicks in full power. But the weakness and clumbsiness are sooo much better than they were a year ago and I have had 1 migraine in the last 11 months. Does that happen in parkinsons? I am 80 sure it is early onset parkinsons. But we can run a specialized brain scan that looks at the dompamine regions of your brain... I am neurodivergent my dopamine is supposedly not normal by default. What is the incidence of false positives on this test? Zero... I think Skeptical look set up the order of the test. I am sure you can find information about what to expect with parkinsons on google and once they get the test done we will call you with the results within a week. goodbye. so now I am schrodingers neurodegenerative autistic. gaslit for a year and a half that it is my anxiety now told it is my brain dieing in my skull. and this test will prove it when we get around to it. 2 weeks until my next counciling appointment.
8246,Shingles? Rinvoq? Pain before rash after Covid booster: Thank you so much for your reply I appreciate it. Its my first time to have any adverse response to a Covid booster are you on a particular biologic?
8258,The person is question was 60s male smoker no known health problems. He was a smaller slighter built guy no obesity or weight issues AT ALL. The only symptom I can think of was a persistent cough and swellingpain of his feet. My uncle passed away suddenly on the 2nd of this month. He woke up feeling off and got up to mow the lawn. He came inside complaining of feeling hot and of chest pains. He took some pain relievers aspirin I think. When he was checked on 30 minutes later he was dead. He appeared to be dead for several minutes. Paramedics came inside and worked on him but it was known almost immediately that he was deceased. An autopsy was performed as ordered by the coroner. As I understand the because of death was something along the lines of coronary heart disease and emphysema. The emphysema did not surprise me he was a smoker. He was adamantly against going to the doctor stupidly stubborn old man the last time I remember him getting treated for anything was a case of shingles about 3 years ago. Are they saying he died of a sudden heart attack? Is there anything we could have done? Was he suffering in his last minutes? I have been beside myself with grief and just want to understand what happened and why.
8259,Hi all.... anyone have bad reaction to the shingles vaccine I am completely torn tiredface about this. Worried to get shingles and worried it will because a flareup. Thoughts? Thanx
8266,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Lmfaooo I have a scar on my cheek because of how hard I scratched that spot. The SOCKS my mom had to duct tape around my arms. Gently lol
8268,Put me out of my misery.: The shingles shots put me on the couch for two days too. Just binge watch something and nap.
8272,Shingles and other Vaccines: Shingles vaccine were BAD Covid not as bad but still ugh. Funny I have had some crazy shots and these were among the worst reactions. Still better than getting the actual illnesses
8274,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I was sexually active before the vaccine and then too old once it became widespread. I had a radical hysterectomy at 35 for cervical cancer. Whatever side effects you are concerned about pale in comparison. Do it. My 13 year old is fully vaccinated with Gardisil and did fine.
8277,Shingles shot Ack: Can confirm. I have had shingles twice and even though the shot did suck it was still better than shingles.
8280,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus does have a sense of humor
8281,So sorry. Got the 2shot Shingrix 5 years ago and fortunately no bad reaction. Tips that will help you hydrate with water and electrolytes throughout the day take an ibuprofen if sore take a tolerable hot shower as that will help with body aches too. And rest
8285,Looking for advicehelp. I am a 27 year old female otherwise healthy. 5'3 125 pounds non smoker non drinker no medications besides birth control no known health issues. A few weeks ago I had a horrible flu. 10 days after that I woke up to a huge rash all over my body and another fever. At first I thought it was the chicken pox never had it as a kid and I have low immunity to it even after being vaccine Fever was coming and going over the next few days and the rash got worse but did not blister like chicken pox would so called health link and they advised given the symptoms to go to ER. Went to ER on December 1st tested negative for everything influenza Covid rsv measles rubella a few others and blood work looked normal. Doc said it was probably a viral rash with a late onset from whatever made me sick in the couple weeks prior. Wrote a rx for a small tube of antifungal cream and said it should go away within a week or so. Well it did not. Its actually getting worse by the day. And the itching is unreal. The bumps on my chest area have gotten so severe that it almost looks like one big patch of shingles or eczema. The rest of my body has small red bumps some forming dead flaky skin. This rash extends from my scalp to the tops of my feet with my trunk inner thighs and groin getting the worst of it. My back itches and burns no matter what I am wearing. I have tried the antifungal cream zinc oxide calamine oatmeal cold damp towels and Benadryl. Nothing is soothing for more than a couple minutes and nothing is helping this go away. Is it normal for a rash to continue to get worse for 2 weeks before it starts to get better? I am miserable. I have 4 kids I take care of all day and it is impacting my life in the worst way. I will add that nobody in my family has gotten sick in any capacity. No flu symptoms or a rash. It is only me
8287,Shingles shot: I had shingles in my late 30salmost 40. Got it on Valentines Day. It was also on my face neck completely covered one ear. It was excruciating I had small children and when they would jump on the couch it would send what felt like jolts of electricity from my fingertips up to my face The fatigue was also brutal for about a month. They say its much worse when older so I hope to never get this again. I got my vaccine a couple years ago with no side effects for either one. Would have done it anyway
8288,I am on day 7 of my shingles rash outbreak but I have been having stomach issues since well before the rash appeared. Since the start of the rash I have had horrible constipation. One time I resolved it with a suppository. But this time I am trying to use Senna pills. I had some pain meds containing codeine. I have stopped taking them because the constipation is so uncomfortable. The pain is bad but not bad enough to relieve it at the price of my bowels. I look and feel like a stuffed potato. I am so bloated. I have taken Senna once and it is been almost 24 hours with no movement pun intended. I read an article on what to do and I am going to be taking another pill tonight and then if nothing happens another in the morning. I just have to gradually increase the dose until it works. I just feel horrible. I feel bad enough without this bloating. Has anyone had any luck with a constipation treatment?
8290,"I decided to get the Pneumovax vaccine after having a bout of pneumonia last year. Little did I know that the side effects would hit me like a ton of bricks. The muscle pain from head to toe is unbearable, and I feel like I've been hit by a bus. I know the vaccine is supposed to prevent future illness, but right now, I'm not so sure it's worth it. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to the Pneumovax vaccine?"
8291,Hi guys I found out I Am pregnant a few weeks before my little guy turned one and I Am trying to not stress about my cervix but here I am. For my pregnancy with my son I was always boarderline short around 2.4cm and did progesterone only with pretty solid modified bedrest. My water broke at 36w1d and my son was born. I Am not 100 convinced it was due to my cervix though as I was 1cm dilated at 32weeks and still 1cm when my water broke side note I got the rsv vaccine 5 days prior and pre term labor was listed as a possible side effect  Anyway what is everyone is experience with a second pregnancy that did progesterone only for their first? Did you need a cerclage or just do progesterone only again? My doctor is convinced I just have a naturally short cervix not necessarily an IC. I Am only 7weeks and cervix is 3.11cm. Trying to not jump ahead of myself but curious of others experience and trying to mentally prepare for pregnancy with a short cervix now with a toddler .
8293,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I wish it was mandatory here I got shingles and I wanted to end it all.
8295,Massive headache body aches and truly horrible nights sleep. Also the worst arm pain I Have ever had from a shot. Its better than shingles. Its better than shingles. Its better than shingles. Its better than shingles. Its better than shingles.

Definitely some scary stuff I Have had vin 1 and according to my ob there is noting more of concern after the lesion was removed but I Have experienced mild burning going all the way to my rectal area. I Do Not Know what it could be or even what test to get done to find out what it is. Its been a total mental challenge with this HPV stuff ugh
8300,Shingles vaccine experience: To avoid sore arm post vaccine do pushups right after. My husband has multiple shingles outbreaks but insurance will not cover the vaccine till he is older
8301,Shingles vaccine experience: I had chicken pox as a kid but it was a very mild case. When my younger sibling caught it about 8 years later everyone else in my household had it already so we did not take any precautions. Well I caught it again and the second time I was a teenager. Not only was I very sick with terrible pain high fever and swollen lymph nodes but I also had so many of those darn boils. As someone who had chicken pox twice what does that mean in terms of how my body might respond to the vaccine? I could see it as a positive because I have lots of antibodies or potential to create them anyway or a negative in that I am apparently more susceptible to that virus than the average person. Anyone else have chicken pox twice and gotten the shingles vaccine?
8308,Shingles vaccine: I had flulike symptoms for 12 days afterwards but its worth it. Shingles is a terrible illness very painful.
8309,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mom got it on the roof of her mouth. She was in so much pain. I had it when I was a toddler.
8310,RSV vaccine: Please get it Its not a vaccine just antibodies. I got it for my LO and he had no side effects

8319,Shingles? Rinvoq?: The intense stabbing flank pain has been my most common A.S symptom for over 10 years. I think its radiating down my flank through nerves but the source is inflammation at one specific rib joint.
8322,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: No shit.... I only just got the shingles it is really painful. I have a patch of seriously sore shingles on my bicep fuckin really red and Soooo itchy. Anyway I am in Ireland when my father in law heard about my shingles he said you should head out to see Pat Welsh he has the cure I laughed at that shit but I will try anything at this stage so went to see him yesterday he used an old style martchstick to rub every sore on my arm whilst mumbling some prayers shingles is from my chest down my right arm to my middle finger no fukkin shit the shingles is gone the patch on my bicep is there but no longer sore or itchy. I am convinced it is the phosphorus sulfide in the matchstick but who knows it could have been god. Pat did not want money or anything he only asked for me to light a candle for himself the lost souls.
8325,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: omg reading these comments is making me feel better. my bby got her shots yesterday. no fever but we have her tylenol just in case. rubbed alcohol on her legs so they would not get stiff when she slept. she did amazing. extra spit up though and reading from the comments that normal. but she was happy today smiling and trying to laugh she did spit uo the oral medicine they gave her at the hospital i do not rmb which one it was but hopefully it does not effect her immunity
8326,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Sorry you had to go thru that so young
8327,2 month vaccines and RSV: My son had his first three vaccines less than 24 hours after birth in the hospital. Vitamin K Hepatitis RSV You he cried when it happened but not for long. You could look into numbing cream that Emla stuff is great if you follow directions and let it sit for a minimum of an hour before any injections. Will be putting that on my boy for his 6 week injections.
8333,Am I a bad person?: I just did my shingles vaccine so I can start treatment and that was sucky
8334,when did you first notice a difference?: Second day shot day 1000 AM I Am always hungry
8339,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I do not fuck with any of the newer vaccines. I have had Shingles I caught it early and it was not bad.
8342,Valtrex Breastfeeding: I just got over a bout of shingles. I really think the valtrex is what helped me stay in the mild case territory. I initially directly nursed but the rash was close enough that I chose to pump instead throughout this time frame. Got clearance from my doc and babys pediatrician to continue to feed with no concerns. Good luck with recovery. Take care of yourself I found I had to alternate Tylenoladvil pretty frequently to be ahead of the painitch.
8347,I just turned 25 and started my final year of law school and I Am on day 4 of shingles on my face currently in the blister stage see photo. I was diagnosed very quickly and put on valtrex and gabapentin 300mg 1xday. The pain has really been awful. I Am unable to sleep more than 34 hours a night if I sleep at all. I Am having to miss class and isolate from everyone due to contagiousness and also embarrassment about how I look right now. Does anyone have recommendations for the pain andor painbased insomnia? I Have read that gabapentin is supposed to make you tireddrowsy and even help with insomnia but I feel like I Am having the opposite experience. Is it ridiculous to go to a doctor and ask for either a higher grade pain medication or a prescription for insomnia? I Have been averaging about 34 hours of sleep a night and I feel like I Am already losing my mind only 4 days into what will likely be a multiple weeks journey.
8350,Just diagnosed today: Pleased to hear it I Am also getting myself better now getting a lot of help from self help guides the kind of thing I Have laughed at in the past. Going for my first every therapy session next week I Am trying to stay off Google at the moment but stress and anxiety can do such a number on your body and in the past i dismissed that thinking nah there is something seriously wrong. Sounds like you have experienced it already so have some good coping mechanisms I Am just learning them now. But yea do not brush off stress as the because even if you feel fine. Our bodies are weird little things so take care and be kind to yourself. My bout of shingles also came following the hardest workout Id ever done in my life and then a lack of sleep due to travel so i think it was a combination of mental and physical stress.
8352,I had my first shingrex shot today. I had shingles last year and never want to go through that again. This vaccine is supposed to be pretty uncomfortable so I am waiting for the side effects to kick in although I am going to try to distract myself. If anyone else has had the shingrix vaccine let me know how it went for you
8355,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: My husband's daughter got the HPV vaccine at age 14. She was hugely active up to that point  gymnastics dance and horse riding. She had several episodes when she lost control of her legs  partial paralysis  at school which doctors could not explain. She is now fully recovered but look up class action lawsuits in Europe where injured girls some in wheel chairs are trying to get compensation and bring the issue to light.
8364,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Deserved it for that weak ass vagina bit pure Dee Reynolds
8368,Shingles vaccine: My mom had Shingles a few years ago I think she was maybe 59 or 60 at the time. It was brutal. At first we did not know what it was but because I had seen it on a friend when I was in my 20's I knew instantly she had it. The whole one side of her face dropped down blisters etc. and she suffered for sure. It took a long time to regain the feeling in her facial nerves maybe a year or so. My motherinlaw also had it internally and was in serious discomfort. Neither ever had the Shingles vaccine before getting it but changed their minds after the fact. I am definitely going to be getting the Shingles vaccine when it is time for me I can guarantee that I have seen too much of shingles lol.
8370,"Shingles: If I understand Op's post, her doctors pushed ahead with her chemo and didn't arrange for her to get a shingrix vaccine before starting chemo. As bad luck would have it, she got shingles right after chemo started. Anyone who's going to get chemo and be immunocompromised as a result should get the vaccine a head of treatment. For bone marrow cancer treatments, they will put you on a daily prescription for acyclovir right off the bat when starting induction treatment and you stay on it after one year+ of getting your stem cell transplant when you start getting all your vaccinations again. Shingles is pretty serious. I'm surprised her doctors didn't at least start her on acyclovir since she hadn't been vaccinated. Unnecessary suffering if you ask me assuming they knew she wasn't vaccinated. I'm of the understanding that people who get shingles can have it return and more than once so I don't believe getting it imparts any immunity to it. Don't understand why this post was downvoted. Might have been helpful to know."
8376,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I was hella stressed out with the newborn I have a feeling I would not have gotten shingles if that had happened to my back at a different point in my life when I was more chilled out. but I am also sure that it would not have happened at that time without hurting my back... my blisters were on the exact dermatome that corresponded to where she cracked it the T5 vertebra. It was really cool actually. My shingles were so mild that by the time I realized I was not just under the weather with a weirdly painful simultaneous rash I was already almost recovered. So I was really fascinated by it lol
8382,"Some positive information for a chage: I'm from an Eastern European country where the anti-vaccine community is incredibly powerful. The overall coverage dropped below 80% and it's not slowing down. We had about 2000 cases of measles in 2018 that could have been avoided, and about 20 dead kids. I'm also the father of two, and my daughter, the oldest, caught varicella (chickenpox). Since she was contagious two days before any symptoms, she also infected my three-year-old boy. The doctor that gave me the diagnostic for chickenpox said that I still have time to vaccinate the boy. I did and two weeks later he also had the first symptoms. And by symptoms I mean he had three small eruptions on the torso that didn't even get liquid inside before healing. Use the varicella vaccine. It's extremely effective, and with a second shot, the kid is not even going to get it."
8383,Shingles vaccine experience: I scheduled mine on a Friday just after work. Recovered by Monday after a weekend in bed with 102 fever. I Am very sensitive to discomfort.
8385,Doctor accidentally gave me two doses of RSV shot.: I cannot even imagine. Just one Covid shot takes me out for a day I am not sure what 48 in a month would do to me
8388,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Damn. 53 and just got my first shot 2 days ago. Was sore af yday...
8389,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: YES It is unreal. I felt like someone was stabbing me with an ice pick every 20 seconds all day.
8390,RSV vaccine experience: We were in the ER last night because my newborn with RSV is barely drinking anything but her lungs look and sound amazing. I do not imagine wed have been as lucky without me getting vaccinated at 37 weeks. I also got the flu vaccine while pregnant and she did not get that at all.
8391,Shingles vaccine experience: Friend's mom just passed she got vertigo and went into a coma randomly. Her docs said it could have been the shingles virus that made its way into her brain. vaccine me up
8394,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had an outbreak at 24 and gave my thengirlfriend her first case of chicken pox. Still have a dead nerve section on my shoulder blade. Where I live right now it costs 500 for the rounds. it is only covered by the government over age of 65.
8395,WHAT TO DO WHEN SHINGLES STRIKE: Yes to the nausea and not just because of the antivirals. I had low grade nausea for about five days before the rash popped up. Doc says it is typical with shingles and wrote me a script for Zofran which helps. Even now two weeks later I can still wake or go to bed feeling slightly nauseous.
8397,"Can I volunteer as a guinea pig for CRISPR-CAS9?: I was diagnosed with ocular herpes zoster, the vision in my right eye has slowly been deteriorating and the concern I have is that eventually I will be effectively blind in my right eye. I read a medical journal ( <url> ) reporting that CRISPR was 90% effective in treating herpes simplex in mice. I would waive doctors of liability and volunteer myself for CRISPR treatment, are there any avenues that anyone is aware of that I could investigate for these purposes?"
8400,Shingles vaccine and Herpes: I was diagnosed in May and got my second shingles vaccine in July. I Have had no outbreak.
8404,Vaccines: My baby was fully vaccinated because to summarize I believe in science . Baby got rsv vaccine and came down w rsv at 3 wks old adjusted 11 wks actual . Baby still ended up in hospital and the docs all confirmed it could have been MUCH worse if he had not been vaccinated . Summary side effects from vaccines are not the scary thing the sicknesses particularly without any protection are.
8408,WHAT TO DO WHEN SHINGLES STRIKE: I am pretty sure I had shingles back in FebruaryMarch and I thought I was going to die. I only got a few questionable spots on my neck but the muscle spasms that ran down that nerve were excruciating. We think it hit that nerve because it was still healing from a bike accident. By the time shingles came up it was too late for antivirals and I basically had to suffer through. If you even so much as suspect shingles get to the doctor as soon as possible. I never want to go through that again
8409,Well we are all in this together and its great you are all here even if its not so great I reckon I had my Scabies for months before it spread all over me. It started I think with a nodule on my buttock and I did not know what it was. Then my belly button started itching around my torso and now everywhere. Initially thought I had shingles but Dr told me it was folliculitis and the pharmacist told me its scabies. I was able to get Invermectin in Australia on prescription. I Have got 15mg for Day 1289 and 15. Had Day 12 so far. I Am up to Date 5 now. Its improving. Worst part is nodules on my buttocks and groin. Had them on my hips they are clearing. I Am really concerned about the nodules. Can I ask what you had success with? I Have read about vinegar sulphur cream 20?? neem oil A lot of products are hard to get. eg Permethrin is a worldwide shortage. Benzyl Benzoate hard to find. No Lyclear. Tenumax only in Sweden??. I can only locate 10 sulphur cream. Etc. Years ago I got genital warts. Dermatologist said I had the worst case he would ever seen by a long shot. Multiple nitrogen treatments had insufficient effect he sent me to a surgeon. I actually managed to bring it to an end with castor oil and baking soda but it took a couple of months. I tend to get severe everything. The nodules are on my butt cheeks probably hard to cover with whatever. When I was being treated for Folliculitis I was prescribed Cefalexin antibiotic and that had a bit of an effect on shrinking nodules on my hips. I note the fat layer is not so great there whereas as butt cheeks are just fat mainly and may respond differently or not as well. I Have also got Lichen Sclerosis. So I Have got a couple of things up my sleeve yet but desperate like you guys to get rid of it as soon as possible. Thank you
8410,24hr mark of the shingles shot so far not my favorite.
8414,Has this ever happened to anyone?: Got this after flu and shingles vaccine
8419,"I have Shingles, but never had Chickenpox: How is this possible? I was under the impression that if you never had Chickenpox you couldn't get Shingles. Both my sons had Chickenpox when they were young, but I didn't get it. Could I have gotten it and it didn't pronounce any symptoms and just layed dormant in my system and just now pronouncing as Shingles? I did get the Covid vaccine and booster, could that have caused Shingles? UPDATE : Thankfully it seems I have a mild case of Shingles. Started having the burning pain constantly on my right side to the middle of my back 11 days ago. On the 3rd day the rash appeared, started using Calamine lotion immediately. Around day 7 or 8 saw a few tiny blisters, but they never oozed so no scabs. Only one spot which was the biggest itched a few times. Put calamine lotion on entire rash several times a day and yesterday which was day 10 the rash started turning purplish and isn't raised now. I can run my finger over it and its flat. I do still have pain, but it started lessening on day 9, thankfully no where near as bad as it was. Praying I'm over the worst and don't have lingering nerve pain. Thank you all for the replies, very much appreciated."
8426,Shingles and other Vaccines: A friend of mine got it about 6 years ago and she said she still has nerve pain scalp and neck. Her experience is what convinced me to go and get the 1st vaccine.
8435,Effectiveness of rsv vaccineantibodies? Nurses have you noticed less admissions from babies that received this?: My baby had the shot at 2 weeks I came down with a pretty bad cold this last week. Not sure if its RSV but little man caught it and the worst hes had is a snotty nose. Hes coughed maybe a handful of times.
8436,Put me out of my misery.: Believe its much better than getting shingles. I had that and missed two weeks of work. Extremely painful.
8438,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not think my parents ever brought my brother and I to a chicken pox party. It was never mentioned to us and I never got chicken pox. I Am pretty sure we were vaccinated. I was 3 when the vaccine came out so I must have been.
8439,Hello I have not been sleeping well and this has not been good for my MG and general health. I looked into supplements and took Ltheanine and GABA and they seemed to help. I am also reducing my prednisone dose. In my research about GABA I read that MG patients may have antiGAD antibodies which stop the synthesis of glutamine into GABA which the body needs. I also read that Gabapentin an analogue to GABA is often contraindicated in MG patients. I suppose my question is what does it mean to be an analogue to GABA what is the difference between taking gabapentin and just taking a GABA supplement? Also if the GABA is helping me should I look into whether I have antiGAD antibodies? Any experience with any of this? I am coming off chemo for ovarian cancer followed immediately by pneumonia followed immediately by stage 2b type b2 thymectomy with hyperplasia which existed before the chemo the thymectomy was after followed immediately by shingles. I actually think the MG started about a week before the shingles. Before all this I have always been healthy and athletic with the exception of eating too much junk and carrying too much fat in my 30s never clinically obese but borderline. I Am 40f now. MG came on fast and had me hospitalized last month two months after onset of symptoms. I just want to understand what is going on.
8442,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got lucky and got to the doctor for some antivirals early enough for it to do some good. I only had a patch about the size of my hand on my back but it was there for about 6 weeks. The very next day after I started the antivirals one entire side of my back turned red like it was about to break out all across me but the meds knocked it back down to the initial spot.
8445,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox when I was in kindergarten in 9091 and got shingles last year thankfully limited to only about a 2 spot on my hip. It was right at my waistband which sucked but it only itched and could have been way worse so I will take it as a win on the whole. I still have a craterscar above an eyebrow from scratching of a bump 34 years ago.
8449,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: Yep the vaccine is miserable. But what my husband went thru with shingles one hundred percent made it worth getting. I dread the second one.
8450,41 and got Shingles: 39. Went to my allergy Dr with a weird rash that hurt and itched. He says Not an allergy you have got shingles. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?. Me ..
8453,Is it me or is every medication for this condition and its symptoms horrific?: Sorry. I got through it with Tylenol and valtrex. When I read the potential side effects for the gabapentin I did not want to touch it. It was excruciating for a while I went back to work about 5 days after starting the valtrex. I had no side effects from the valtrex thankfully I do tend to react to medication. I had some nausea fever and chills from the shingles though. Had it on my face at 33 yo. I honestly felt like giving birth was easieri think just because I knew the pain would be ending within hours. I hope it gets better for you very soon Hang in there
8454,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: Mine got it last week Its not a vaccine its just antibodies that will last like 5? months so if they get RSV in their first season they will already have protection and make any RSV infection mild. It is another poke to deal with but Id rather do that than potentially hospitalize my baby if she gets RSV.
8456,Did your baby do well with the HiB vaccine?: I think my daughter did well with that one around 3 months. She Is on a delayed schedule due to being hospitalized very young and picking and choosing which ones to do at what time to best help her immune system. She should have them all by 2.5 years As someone who is relatively crunchy but still does vaccines I know someone who went blind from the measles in the 70s as a kid. I think she also lost partial hearing. Shingles also stinks and that can happen if you get Chicken Pox. If we can avoid stuff like that for our babies we should
8458,For those here that are unfortunate enough to suffer with repeated attacks have you found anyway to minimisereduce outbreaks? Holistic or medical? I got shingles for the first time at 13 did not have it again until I hit 30. I am now 35 and have had it 7 maybe 8 times in the last t years. All but once its reoccurred in the same place which means I now have beautiful scars tracking the dermatome. How wonderful. I started taking lysine and zinc around a month ago and I already take a multivitamin which has plenty of b vitamins in it. I do not smoke rarely drink. Do have hypothyroidism and am a single parent so constantly exhausted. Not much I can do about those two. I am not eligible for the vaccine. What else can I do?
8462,Vaccine reanalysis and excess deaths: So clots and heart issues wether you have had the jab or not. Cancers from the jabs. I ended up being hospitalised when i had covid Dec22 had POTS symptoms after and on a low dose betablocker now. Unvaccinated just had covid the once.
8464,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I was so stressed I got the shingles at 30. Of course it was on my scalp and face. Surprisingly painful. I have a small spot on my scalp where the hair just does not grow right anymore. Get the shot if you can loudlycryingface
8465,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Had shingles 3 times in my 30s. Insurance covered the shot after the 2nd time. Shots were super painful in terms of shots. BUT I did get shingles a fourth time after the vaccine about a year later so not a total fail safe. And yeah I was super stressed all the times I got shingles so try to keep your stress at a minimum
8467,Shingles Vaccine: I felt like someone kicked me straight in the balls for 3 days and stayed glued to the bed or couch. It fucking sucked.
8468,Shingles vaccine experience: Ya it hurt. Mine was not that terrible but still not fun. However I have seen some folks miserable with shingles and want no part of that. My wife is still on the fence. I hope it does not bite her in the
8469,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had shingles at 48 and they recurred three times before I was finally able to get the vaccine. I was super lucky in that my case was not that bad. The rash was on my chest and torso and it definitely hurt and I was super tired and felt run down for months but I feel like it could have been so much worse after hearing about what others experienced. The doctor thought shingles was triggered by my super stressful job. I have a new less stressful job now FWIW I had a terrible case of chicken pox when I was 11 was out of school for three weeks.
8472,I hope it went well I Am getting my COVID and flu vaccines later today. Already had the shingles vaccines a couple of years ago Be prepared for the second shingles vaccine to knock you flat for a couple of days. Its a real donkey kick
8473,Shingles vaccine: Got shingles at age 38. It was brutal and the residual neuropathy lasted for months. Get the vaccine.
8474,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: He was totally fine. Had it at 4 days old the nurse said he should not have any side effects and she was right.
8476,Shingles vaccine: The shots were no prob for me
8478,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yup we had that great to get chicken pox for the first time when You are young vs older. My son 5 just got chicken pocks. The vaccine he had turned it from a huge issue into a few small marks on his body and the itching was not bad was over quickly. No reason to have a party as all his friends are vaccinated. Had you not had the anti bodies from the chicken pocks party and getting it young you may have died getting shingles. Thank your parents.
8480,Shingles Is NO Joke: It gets pretty fuckin gnarly especially if I have to wear pants with a belt which is pretty much every time I go out. Feels like my waistband has 80 grit sandpaper covered in industrial strength oven cleaner and unfortunately I know what a chemical burn from oven cleaner feels like on the inside.
8488,Shingles shot Ack: Yeah I thought it would not be a big deal because the flu shots never bothered me. The booster was just as bad for me as well.
8491,: why was this noticed less in 2020 when bodies were piling up as compared to 2021 after the vaccine rollout?
8495,i am so sorry our childs chickenpox ruined your plans: My son got the vaccine at his 12mo appt I tried to push to get it earlier because I got shingles when he was 7mo but they could notwould not do it I was nursing and my rash was an inch under my boob so that definitely made me nervous and I double covered everything
8497,Furiosa A Mad Max Saga Doug Reviews: amazing how this happened after the shot but let us not talk about that...
8505,Shingles shot: I was lucky enough to be able to get my shingles vaccine at 45. I do not understand why most people are not allowed to get it until 50 when we know people can get shingles in their 30s and 40s. First shot was pretty bad though. Not looking forward to the second shot.
8506,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: That damn vax knocked me on my ass. Worse than the Covid one if you ask me. Better than getting shingles of course."
8509,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles in my 30's from the vaccine strain of the virus I never had a wildnatural infection was immunized at age 19 with the attenuated live vaccine. There is a solvable problem around not being reexposed to the virus to top up immunity. I expect the vaccine schedules will eventually catch on but it sucks to be caught in the middle.
8510,Hopefully I Am not breaking rules posting this. This is one of the worst pains in my life My husband got vaccinated. I knew I needed to get vaccinated but I kept putting it off. Big mistake Huge Please talk to your doctor to see if you are at risk and need the vaccine. This pain is the worst
8512,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I had a mild case as a baby and then in kindergarten I had a second time it was bad. So bad. I missed a month of school and I have a few scars left from a few really bad ones.
8515,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Make sure it is covered under insurance. I thought mine was and I got a 500 bill. I had to pay or else. Made me extremely sick for three days also.
8516,I was diagnosed just over 3 weeks ago with shingles. I am female and 61 years old in good health. And yes I have had the Shingrix vaccine. The doctor put me on antivirals immediately. As a result I only developed a small amount of rash with blisters on my ribcage under my right breast. However there was a significant amount of pain associated with that area both at the rash itself and on my back exactly opposite to the rash. I also had an area on my ribcage on my right side that gave me a significant amount of pain it probably would have developed into a rash with blisters if I had not gone on the antivirals as quickly as I did. I also have had quite a bit of itching. As of today 3 weeks 2 days the rash has healed although I have a bit of scarring from it. But I am still periodically getting pretty bad sharp stabbing pains where the rash was and on my back especially if my day has been particularly stressful. I know it can take some time for shingles to resolve but I would appreciate any insight from those who have had it as to whether my experience sounds like a reasonably normal healing progression. Thank you very much for your help.
8518,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Notsofun fact you can still get shingles if you have had the chickenpox vaccine. A small percentage of people who get the chickenpox vaccine still get shingles. My 34 year old coworker got shingles last year he had the chickenpox vaccine. It was brutal.
8522,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: Lol not well I take an ibuprofen and an acetaminophen right before I go to bed and hope for the best. When I eventually wake up and cannot fall back asleep from the itching I will just go grab an ice pack. The worst part of it is I had such a large patch of shingles I cannot just use one ice pack for the whole area. It is my chest underarmside boob and my backupper shoulder that thankfully all take turns itching.
8537,Shingles vaccine: I would pick a different day like a Friday. I was laid low with mine lol
8538,Flu and Covid Vaccines: I have gotten them at the same time the last 2 years and threw the shingles vaccine in the mix this year. I got the vaccines on a Friday and felt bleh all weekend but stress dosed and loaded up on salt and made it through. I get vaccinated whenever I am told to and have not yet had covid.
8540,Just posting for some commiseration I guess. Maybe just documenting for others who are questioning their symptoms. I am dealing with shingles for the second time in my life. I had mild chickenpox as a toddler shingles at 12 and now at 37. And I am supposed to be going on a road trip vacation in 1 week out of the country. Feeling discouraged but that could be the Valtrex It started with an all day headache and unusual fatigue on Monday. Possible fever but I had taken Tylenol round the clock all day. I also had a very itchy and dry right eye so I assumed maybe allergies and started using Visine Allergy drops. On Tuesday I felt what seemed like a patch of dry skin on my forehead no itch or pain but I was drawn to touching it because it was there barely. By Thursday I began to feel the telltale rippling or slight prickling of the rash as it worsened. I also noticed swelling in my lymph nodes under my jaw on the right side. The swelling increased and became painful felt like a tender bruise That part concerned me the most. I went to urgent care Friday morning and had to convince the PA that I am a youngish person with shingles again. The rash had not blistered yet. She decided to kindly treat me with Valtrex. By this morning Saturday the blisters have erupted. Lymph nodes are still swollen and painful now on both sides. I have not had any of the pain yet I remember it vividly from when I was younger but feeling more prickly when cold air or movement near my face. I also have dull intermittent pain behind my right eye no vision change and know to go to ER if anything. I am really trying to rest and sleep as much as possible. I am anxious about how it is going to progress going out in public because I have some things I need to get done this week. This would not be the first time an illness has crashed and ruined a vacation I Have been so looking forward to Thanks for reading.
8542,Ok. I appreciate my story will not be unique but hoping there is some light at the end. I already had an autoimmune disorder ALPS that included a predisposition for hivesitchy skin. Its managed with Sirolimus or Rapamycin. I got shingles directly after covid back in June. The PHN has been wild and unrelenting over the last six weeks its ramping up which I think coincides with our summer weather also ALPS makes you much hotter too. I Have tried all the usual suspects medication wise including Pregablin and amitriptyline. The latter is better as it at makes me drowsy at night but I still wake with the most intense itching where my rash was back in June. I Am starting to accept that this might not go away and trying to live with this. Due to my autoimmune my Haematologist wants me to keep taking valaciclovir each day but i found this REALLY hammered my mood. So much so i stopped within 9 days. I am told I can get the shingles vaccine closer to my 12th anniversary. I know some will have this worse but are there any recommended diets or other things we can try? Also did anyone else get it directly after covid?
8545,Dr Haider fun story. I had CP at 5yo am too old to have been offered the vaccine back then. Fast forward 30yr. My kids have received a select few vaccines years ago CP included. Within a week or so of my youngest getting the CP vaccine I got shingles.
8548,Is this True? I know a few people who have recently experienced shingles. I had the shot before Covid and the Covid vaccines however not sure if those vaccines negated the shingles shot.
8549,Shingles scares me I did not feel bad and my arm barely hurt. Pharmacist says 2 is usually worse. Hopefully not but if it is...it is. I know a lady that said she barely got out of bed for 2 years before the shot
8550,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Maybe you caught a bug and its just a coincidence that symptoms showed up after the shot? Have you taken a Covid test?
8552,Shingles vaccine experience: I had a similar experience with my first. The second was a nonevent.
8553,My two year old has been sick for two weeks now so phlegmy its making him throw up fevers etc. Today we went to the doctor and she says its probably RSV and may be starting to turn into pneumonia. My dad and husband also got sick while my mom the baby and I have been unscathed. The three of us have the RSV vaccine I got the vaccine while pregnant but went into labor 13 days later so baby also got the antibodies shot. We try to keep the toddler away from the baby but its almost impossible and dad has held him less than usual but still. I can only imagine how susceptible the baby would be otherwise and its so scary to think of a two month old getting RSV. So grateful we were able to get immunized and have this bit of protection
8554,this is the sixteenth day of me being ill. since then i took 5x1 every day i will finish my second box today. shingles have stopped spreading fairly early limited to two areas of my back. two weeks later they have dried up completely but still not totally gone i mean my skin is red there and you can see the spots. i had pain every day in the first few days kind of bad. but in the past week it became tolerable. on the weekend it was a bit shittier again but now i have my first day of not using painkillers. otherwise i feel good. should i continue aciklovir for prevention? or how does this work? thanks
8555,Shingles vaccine experience: I had a very mild case of shingles around my ear and figured this would give me immunity. Then my husband told me about a coworker that got shingles over a large part of his body and horrible painful side effects that lasted for months. It was nearly debilitating for him. I got both doses of the vaccine and had next to no side effects.
8559,Are you 50? Get your shingles vaccine. Studies have shown that people who get a shingles outbreak have a 20 greater chance of developing dementia. Links below.: Get the vaccine. I am 52 and got shingles over the summer. I was absolutely miserable. I am just now to the point where the nerve pain is mostly gone. It is awful. Get the vaccine.
8562,I knew about this so hence there is no way I am taking this or any other so called vaccine. My wife's cousin had the shingles jab last winter and within days had shingles she was not impressed.
8566,So I have had my diagnosis since April of last year and I have not had any infections until now. I am waiting to start Rinvoq feb 7 but that may be delayed because I have some infection. I am only taking plaqeunel as the others ruined my white blood counts. I would call my rheumatologist clinic but they are closed weekends. So maybe I should go to a walk in? I am terribly congested coughing occasionally but weirdly completely lost my voice. I will not be able to work if I cannot talk. Then comes the thought of having to communicate why I am at a walk in I guess I will be writing notes. I do not think it had anything to do with the shingles shot I hope not. My question is are we able to take antibiotics? I guess I will not be starting rinvoq until this clears up.
8568,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles in my early 30s. Thought it was an ear infection went to the doctor they checked my scalp and saw I had shingles all over my head and dangerously close to my eye and ears. Turns out a LOT of stressors like a job I dreaded going to was enough of a trigger.
8571,Shingles vaccine: Having had shingles any discomfort you might have from 2 doses of the vaccine are very minor compared to actually having shingles. Get the vaccine.
8573,RSV vaccine for infants.: We got it for our baby when he was about two weeks old Dec no side effects at all from it
8574,Shingles: they need to automatically give shingrix to us its crazy that they do not. I Am 27 had it last year and it was the worst pain of my life. It was on my face and very close to my eye and ear I Am lucky I caught it before it got to either. I Have never had chicken pox but the vaccine for it is live so I think its still possible for anyone to get shinglesclearly.
8575,What triggered your BFS? Everyone please leave a quick comment: me too the antibiotics and steroids probably destroyed our immune system hormones and now making our nervous system go crazy. I ALSO HAD HEARING LOSS. it began as ear pain no rash but red and itchy then swollen lymph node below that ear then that side of my face became paralyzed did an MRI which found there to be inflammation on the nerves that control my facial movements. Then I was given A LOT OF MEDICINE antibiotics antivirals corticosteroids etc. They never investigated what caused it I am sure its INTERNAL SHINGLES which is usually in the inner ear and I also had hearing loss after that but hearing came back now.
8578,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: If it was not the flu shots it was def the downs which is now a syndrome to her skull. Dr
8582,RSV vaccine and antibodies: Mine was totally normal after the RSV antibodies. Hes fussy after his regular vaccines but was not after this.
8586,Shingles vaccine experience: Got my first case of shingles before the vaccine on my second case right now. The disease is debilitating. Get the vaccine
8589,I got vaccine acquired shingles as a teenager due to the chicken pox vaccine
8591,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I felt flu like for the day or so after both times. Fatigue and muscle aches. But still so much better than shingles. Id been putting it off until someone I know of got shingles in their eye. I did not even know that was possible.
8593,my brother.... not dead yet also doc I have shingles doc does not say shingles are a side effect of vaccine doc says yo7 are in luck we have a mRNA vaccine for shingles
8596,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: The shots do not prevent shingles but they prevent life altering postherpetic neuralgia. They also likely reduce the severity of a recurrence. I Have had shingles twice since I got my booster but it was super mild and pain free and went away in a week or so.
8597,finally feeling a good amount better from the vaccine Warning to anyone needing to get Shringrix shingles vaccine it is horrible likely stream again tonight but if not tomorrow for sure
8599,RVS vaccine. Anyone know much about it ? Ty: Got my baby hers with her 2 month shots. It should according to the doctor last about 5 months its monoclonal antibodies not a vaccine. If you want it I would recommend getting it earlier since its already cold and flu season. Its already circulating.
8600,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: I had a 30 weeker and he got the rsv shot when he was around 34 weeks then again around 6 months adjusted. Worth it for peace of mind. No adverse side effects. Hes 8 months adjusted now
8604,Shingles and other Vaccines: Shingles is hell on earth. I Have had kidney stones and they pale in comparison. Get the shot. Made me feel slightly ill but well worth it.
8609,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got it just last week. When my first kid started daycare at 4 months she caught RSV and passed it to me. In about two weeks she was fine but I ended up with chronic recurring bronchitis from it for 6 months. I think if someone can get it they should because this is probably the only time well be able to get it until were seniors and in a high risk group again
8612,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1985 never had chickenpox got vaccinated sometime around junior high. Got shingles last year.
8615,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chickenpox three time never bad enough. The first time on my legs second on my arms third whole body. Then when I was 18 I got shingles
8616,First time shingles: Here for you. So rough. I get that vice like crushing feeling on my scalp all the time and down to my ear. Numb cheek and such. Already failed a nerve block...
8617,I 42M was diagnosed with Shingles in March this year which i believe was caused after I took Dexmethasone for a tooth pain. I had it on my back and i took Valtrex the first time i noticed the rash. By The Way i was also on a low dose statin crestor for a long time. I stopped my statin after the shingles incident after reading somewhere that Statins reduce immunity. I got over the pain and neuralgia after few months. But lately I keep getting similar malaise feeling and related pain in the same area very often. My doc has gotten me on 500mg valtrex as a preventative for the post few months. I also take lysine every day. The issue is that I have been having fatigue general malaise and pain similar to days before i had shingles in March. And when i take additional Valtrex it helps. I really hope you can help me understand if it could really be recurrence of shingles and if so what else could i do to prevent recurrence? I avoid nuts and chocolate but stress can be unavoidable sometimes. Thanks in advance for helping
8618,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: Yes. It sucked. But I got it worse when I was talked into getting a covid shot and a flu shot at the same time. That was very bad for me. I will get them separate from now on.
8619,Shingles Vaccine: I have never had it but my parents did and they were sick like the flu for about 2 days and a sore arm for about 5 days.
8622,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got shingles at 45. They are still making me wait until 50 even though I am most likely going to get it again.
8623,I just took my first dose: Hopefully that is all I get I do feel tired but it could be from a mix of my cycle plus the Zofran I took with it. But then again its only been 2 hours. Fingers crossed I do not get any side effects
8626,Shingles vaccine: I got it. I was sick for a week. It mostly affected my prioperception. I was dizzy nauseous when I stood up. I had to lie down. Two female friends under 50 have got shingles and their misery was not what I wanted. My FIL had the vaccine and got it. It was nasty looking and itchy. I cannot imagine how bad it could have been. Next shot comes in September. Will do again.
8627,Because of shingles other than stress?: I got vaccinated as soon as I was able to. I do not want to ever experience that again. It put me in the ICU.
8633,A few questions about vaccines.: Is it safe to get vaccinated at store pharmacies like Publix or CVS? And is it dangerous to get multiple vaccinations in a month? I've gotten the tdap and meningitis vaccines this month and I'm getting the varicella vaccine next week. I also need to get a flu shot soon.
8635,Shingles on my face and scalp: Get an ophthalmologist that specializes in shingles. Ask specifically whether after the initial valtrex should you stay on low dose for an extended period of time. I had mine in April and still struggling with after effects. I had to change ophthalmologist to someone with more expertise and he indicated I should have continued on valtrex.
8637,Going To check this outnever got Covid and have not been sick since before 2020 but I did get shingles within a few months of taking the vaccine and I was 35
8640,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had it on my neck and head about 10 years ago when in my early 40s and i still get this feeling like spiders are crawling on the back of my head and pain on the nerve cluster.
8641,: I told my late grandfather not to take the vaccine and tried to show him this all the way back in 202122. He died in November 2022 from turbo cancer and before that in the summer of 2022 he had a toe amputated because it went blue out of nowhere. 100 sure it is the vaccine He died 6 days after his 83rd birthday so he was old but up until the vaccine he was healthy. I am sure he would have lived another 10 years if it had not been for this semite juice.
8645,Rash on side and pain feels like deep bruised: Age 37 Sex m Height 5'9 Weight 190 Race white Duration of complaint 3 days Location right flank Any existing relevant medical issues none Current medications none Posting for my husband he has a rash on his right side that hurts like a deep bruise and looks like blisters we fear it is shingles but no money for co pay at the doctors right so waiting it out for the time. what are some symptoms we can check off for shingles to maybe tell us that isn't what it is or yeah we need to see if we can get someone to loan us money for the co pay to the doctors. We are concerned with passing it we have 4 kids all fully vaccinated not completly worried about them since they have had there shots but we still worry. rash images <url>
8651,Shingles shot: I got the first one in July. Aside from a slightly sore arm no effects. Will probably get the second sometime in October. I Am prepared for effects but I do not expect it to be too terrible.
8653,I found this unsent from last night. I must be very tired as I woke up 30 minutes ago. In that 30 minutes I have deleted 20000 emails from a account as they have a new delete feature. I am out of bed now I have been sleeping a lot since Shingles vaccine Thurs.
8654,I voted early as I had shingrix vaccine yesterday and was worried that I might be feeling too shitty to stand in line today. Early voting all electronic so should mean quick counting tonight.
8656,Hello I 23 Male 180 60kg white german non smoker no drugs living in Germany have a relative who got a swelling and pain. I touched it 2 days ago and yesterday I know it was stupid. We thought its probably just muscular and when he got a bump on his head he went to a doc today and it came out as shingles. I touched the red thing which was most likely a blister. He gets treatment for it but I personally do not know what to do. I feel a bit sick today but due to my allergy dust mite I feel sick a lot of times and it most likely resolves within a day or 2. But the fact that I most likely got shingles from contact is bothering me. Can I go to a doc and get or ask for a specific medication that can help? Are Antiviral medications helpful at this early stage could ask my doc. Is there something preventable to do so I do not get an outbreak or just mild symptoms? When are Antiviral medications advised? What to do if I get neurological symptoms like numbness or tingling I had this type of stuff before due to Covid and it took me about 2 years to be back to normal even though I get tingling and numbness sometimes so I do not want to live through it again.
8657,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I was vaccinated at 50yrs old. I am 52 now and 5 weeks in and finally healing up. From what i gather mine was pretty mild to what some on here have experienced
8658,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I got it at 51 and my wife at 56. It was mild for me and devastating for her. Get that damn vaccine stat
8659,Hey guys. I have been taking Humira 40mg for 14 weeks. Everything was going great until last week when I got shingles. I got quite a significant rash on my hip. Its all settled now after taking anti virals  skipping my regular Humira dose however my lymph nodes in my groin are still enlarged. I now need to talk to my rheum again about re starting the Humira but to be honest I Am worried about the shingles coming back or any other significant side effects. I Am planning on having the shingles vaccine now but cannot do this for 12 months due to the fact I only just had shingles. Has this happened to anyone else? EDIT  Sorry I should have been clearer in the original post I Am very well aware that shingles comes from the herpes zoster virus the same as the chicken pox and that I already had that virus in my body. I am also aware that being on an immunosuppressant like Humira is what caused the virus to reactivate. I am a 29 year old male with no other health conditions  getting shingles especially with a rash as extensive as mine was is not normal.
8660,Its just Shingles caused by the vaccine but rebranded to scare the fuck out of all them who still believe Covid was real
8661,It was the same for me rough 24 hrs but then fine except arm soreness. 2nd shot no reaction. I know several people who experienced shingles I would get the vaccine again to avoid the pain they went thru for weeks.
8664,Shingles? Rinvoq? Pain before rash after Covid booster: I had to stop getting covid boosters. They put my disease into hyper drive.
8665,Shingles started about 3.5ish weeks ago with PHN triggered by breaking a rib i am on day 5 of 7 of my antivirals. I Have developed what feels to be an insanely sore throat feels like its almost closed up a bitor feels like i am swallowing a golf ball. My mouth and throat feel SO dry its like I cannot drink enough water to quench my thirst. My head feels heavy and sluggish. The rash is gone and PHN is minimal at this point. Do Not know why i am starting to feel sick now..just when I think i am getting better it feels like I cannot escape it. Anyone else experience this? Is it the shingles or the meds causing this? This is my first time experiencing shingles..i am not a fan.
8666,Any parents get the RSV vaccine for their baby yet? on: My baby had hers. It is not a true vaccine but rather an antibody immunization so rather than triggering am immune response that makes antibodies it gives antibodies directly. Due to this the expected side effects are moxh lower very rare to get a fever etc.. For us this was consistent with our experience and baby had no side effects had fever after regular vaccines.
8670,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Oh man that sucks You just never know how your body will respond. Usually with vaccines I have a sore arm at the injection site for a day or two but for some reason with the shingles vaccine I did not even have that
8671,Day 1628 I Have got shingles again. Sacral S1 dermatome Long Covid Vaccine Injury the gift that does not stop giving . VZV
8672,I got Pfizer Covid vaccine this time. But I also got my flu shingles vaccines at the same time. So far I feel much better than I did after my last Covid booster.
8674,I am a 49F with an autoimmune disease being treated with an INF inhibitor so that makes me at a higher risk of shingles. My first bout of it was about 3 years ago it quickly resolved with an antiviral. I just was diagnosed with my second bout on September 30th and it was markedly different from the first. I started treatment within the first 3 days with an antiviral and a round of prednisone. The pain was debilitating. My rash was on my torso right where my bra sat. I struggled to find and get answers from research and from my doctor. The pain first started where the rash eventually appeared then also went up my side into my armpit and down my arm. I also had pain in the crease of my groinhip. I would have painful chills. I slept with ice packs. My torso felt like I had a bad sunburn literally hurt to move. I am no stranger to pain my autoimmune disease affects my back and I have also had multiple kidney stones. I did get put on gabapentin which helped some. My doctor said it was abnormal to have pain that would cross the midline and in multiple dermatomes. I guess I was abnormal because it was real. I felt like I was losing my mind the lack of sleep did not help. Eight weeks later I am FINALLY seeing the light. My husband touched my back yesterday and I did not pull away because it hurt. Anyhow I just wanted to put this out there in case there was anyone else that was experiencing what I did. I turn 50 in March and will be celebrating my birthday with the shingles vaccine I tried to get insurance to approve it early but with no luck. Anyhow best of luck to anyone going through this. It is miserable.
8678,Anyone else had shingles more than once?: I am 55 and on my 5th bout 2nd time since Shingrix series. But it is milder after that and valtrex helps
8685,So on Saturday my back started to hurt really badly. I went to my husbands holiday party and I was wearing heeled boots so thought I might have kinked a muscle or something. Fast forward to yesterday and I developed a blistery rash. Turns out its SHINGLES and apparently is common among pregnant people because our immune systems are shot. Doctors have reassured me it should not harm the baby but have started me on antivirals. So just wanted to say get back pain checked out even if you think its a pulled muscle
8686,Does this look like contact dermatitis infection shingles or something else? Photos are in reverse chronological order over the course of 4 days. Background I recovered from COVID about 3 weeks ago and experienced a suspected rare autoimmune reaction called erythema nodosum on my legs plus dizziness malaise fever etc in response to the infection. After a couple of trips to the doctor and one trip to the ER for the erythema nodosum bruising I finally saw a dermatologist and they took a biopsy to confirm EN. I am now having a reaction near the biopsy incision and I am worried that its shingles or an infection. The biopsy site is from an EN nodule on my shin just below my knee. Its very itchy. I have a followup appointment with the derm later this week but I am posting here to see if anyone else has had an experience like this with a biopsy andor erythema nodosum and covid. Additional info I am in my mid30s I had shingles in 2020 a few weeks after I recovered from og covid and I have had covid 6 more times since then. I have been vaccinated every other time I have contracted covid EXCEPT this time I kept putting off the vaccine this winter because I was busytravelingetc and obviously not vaccine first time.
8689,Me either but I heard the second dose of the shingles vaccine will kick your butt for a day or so. But believe me you do not want to get the shingles.
8691,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I got vaccinated after I got shingles. I begged for it for months. Anyone who actually had shingles knows how awful it is and most of us are willing to take our chances by taking something that may prevent a recurrence. Clearly I do not trust my immune system enough as I got it at 32 in the first place
8705,Shingles vaccine: Got 1st shot at costco on a Friday only thing was a sore arm on Saturday Sunday was good to go. Did not get 2nd shoot till next year
8706,Shingles at 35: Damn. I Am so sorry how are you healing now? I am a 38F I consider myself very healthy. I too was put through this terror. Mine was all nerve pain stabbing twitching spasming swollen nodes the worst was at night. I thought I was going to die. I thought I had a mass in my cervical spine pushing on my occipital nerve. I explained every detail to 5 doctors in 7 days. I was diagnosed with strep at first and they focused on that plus some other BS about the nerve being compressed by working out. I honestly feel like the dumb one that I did not put it together fasted. I was on a wild goose chase and loosing my mind with fear and pain. My husband is the one who put it together. He finally found my rash. My rash is in my scalp. Very hard to see. I think I started antivirals truly on day 5. The first doctor that prescribed the antivirals gave me 500mg 2x a day for 3 days. I did not think anything of it until I started reading. I went back the next day and the NP agreed that was way too low and gave me a better dose but still not 3000mg a day. I feel robbed I could have started this healing process the day it appeared. cannot figure out why all the doctors would not guess this or suggest it? Antivirals are not opioids? Is it so controversial??? Not to mention the two doctors that is diagnoses shingles told me nothing on how to care for myself how long it could affect me long term issues nothing acted like its a cold. I Have learned more about shingles here on Reddit than anywhere else. I think more of our age group needs to know about it the possibility of getting shingles obviously we are a stressed group and likely had chicken pox as kids. I hope you are feeling better if not now soon
8707,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: my arm was sore for more than week like charlie horse sore. but i do not remember any other side effects.
8708,"MS and Shingles?: I understand that after contracting chickenpox, the proteins for shingle lay dormant in your spinal cord. They can be triggered by a low immune system or stress? If all this is true, does this mean MS patients have an increased risk of Shingles?"
8709,Husband is being nonchalant about vaccines: Putting aside the antiscience misinformation that may be informing your husbands apathy or antipathy towards vaccines to protect your baby from preventable disease  which is a lot to put aside to be honest  your husband should be getting these shots to protect himself as well First week of daycare our baby brought home three viruses including RSV. Babies are germ factories the moment they hit the real world. I had not gotten my flu or RSV shots and got obliterated incl a trip to the ER. My husband did not get it nearly as bad because he was vaccinated.
8711,"Sas and his rash: I'm watching an old episode of the yak and they were talking about chicken pox, sas claimed if he had something that just covered him in dots itd be great for social media. Hilarious hearing this knowing how he was with the rash he had."
8712,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: How silly. I was born in 1994. I am 29 now and was given the chicken pox vaccine. You are just being unreasonable.
8713,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My brother had chickenpox as an adult. It was no joke and led to a pretty lengthy hospitalization.
8714,Vaccines and sarcoidosis: Sarc since 2008. Have taken all the usual vaccines since. Doc did advise against the live flu vac nasal spray way back when I was on a bunch of immunosuppressant stuff but said take everything else.
8715,Same except with the shingles vaccine too. Same nothing reaction. Both doses. Could have injected me with saline for all I knew. Not even so much as a sore arm
8716,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got shingles last year on my side and it wrapped around to my back and when I say that shit is worse than childbirth.. I felt like I was on fire.
8717,Shingles vaccine: I Have had my first and felt fine. I also just got my pneumonia vaccination and felt fine after that one as well. I did have pneumonia in July and it sucked so hard. Please add it to your roster.
8722,I have had covid 19 vaccines. I have just had my 10th bout of shingles the last appeared 48hrs after covid vaccine. I have had enough now i am 56.
8723,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles when I was 27ish. My dr said it was probably stress related. I only had a smaller patch on my back but ooooweeee that hurt so bad I stayed home I worked in the health field with the public and a great deal of elders and did not wear a shirt for a week
8726,I think I Have seen this shingles commercial 8000 times on Hulu.: I have got to say that this commercial does not bother me at all. I have had shingles and it is BRUTAL. Several weeks of pure hell and I still have pain and itchiness almost a year later.
8730,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Spiked her blood and her face...into the floor.
8731,Same here...at most I might have a sore spot at injection site. But whoa...shingles vaccine took me down
8735,TWiV 1090 Clinical update with Dr. Daniel Griffin: I am 68. When I got Covid in Oct 23 I had to beg my doctor and forcefully cite Dr. Griffin to get her to prescribe it as she was going against the very limiting criteria of my our Provincial BCCDC guidelines. I was vaccine not 70 years old and had no underlying health conditions so did not fit the criteria. However I got the Paxlovid and it interrupted my symptoms and turned progression around within 24 hours and a ghastly bout of diarrhea but my illness did not advance. I tested positive for 9 days though so I continued to rest and isolate. I had shortness of breath for 2 months afterwards and I continued to rest and sleep as much as possible 1216 hoursday. Four months out now I am back to normal I think.
8738,Long Covid CFS since Nov 2020 Reinfected Nov 2023 Not only have i developed severe insomnia adrenaline rushes heart racing during sleep since my last reinfection with has been over a year ago I now have shingles cannot believe all of this. I feel like I am just declining more and more new things happening and never ending shitstorm. Who knows what this shingles is going to do to my already debilitating long Covid I am already housebound and suffering
8741,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I Have 47F have had shingles going on 14 times since my mid 20s. Every time it is in a new location and my current flare up is in this exact area of my left arm. I recognize the symptoms quickly and take meds immediately and they never get that bad anymore but shingles is the worst.
8743,How do you handle infants during flu and RSV season?: Baby is 6 months old and we just do not take her where there is a lot of children or people like the library etc. we might take her to the grocery store but usually its not busy there. We are trying to keep her without being sick until she is at least one year old. She had the Rsv shot at 4 months vaccine
8753,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in the seventies and had the pox. On another note my daughter born in the early nineties got the vaccine and has had shingles THREE times in the last decade. Apparently the early vaccines made one prone to shingles. It is miserable. I have heard that they have revamped the vaccines and this is no longer an issue.
8757,First time shingles: so sorry to hear you have this terrible virus. I am on day 22. I did not see any dr. I thought I had poison oak. I realized after the shooting pains and blisters it was shingles. It is a pain I have never experienced the nerve pain is rough. I took benadryl and aspirin before bed and finally got some sleep. The blisters will dry out but at first you need to ice them and cover them with some burn salve or cream. Rest and no stress is key. I did a lot of warm baths for relief it was so soothing. I recommend 3000 mg of lysine right away daily and 3000 mg of vitamin C daily to stop the virus from advancing. This helps so much. you can check out where I learned about these supplements here
8758,For background I was a project manager for many years. It required I remember things. Lots of things. I was good at my job. This morning I went for a routine follow up at my doctors office. My brain went blank so I told the lady at the front desk that I was there for a shingles shot well I suppose an anti shingles shot really And then I laughed because what else can you do? I was seeking the word vaccine. There are days I wonder if this is early onset Alzheimer s or just menopause rearing its ugly head Happy Monday everyone
8760,Do you think getting vaccine of shigles good?: Please get vaccinated. I am going through shingles now and its terrible.
8761,Got mine yesterday. COVID RSV tetanus and shingles shot. I am ready. Do not scare me to get them. Did not even get a sore arm.
8762,"Does Vaccine help recurrent shingles?: Question for those with recurrent shingles: Did the vaccine help? I'm only 38 and just starting my 3rd round of shingles. I get 10 months of PNH after each one, sometimes it ruins my life during that time and sometimes it's in a spot that's more manageable. If you tried the vaccine, can you also specify if your recurrent shingles was always in the same place or in different places (sounds like that implies a different version of the virus)?"
8765,Shingles vaccine: My MIL had shingles. I had chickenpox as a child. I got the first vaccine when I was 55 and the new Shingrix one a couple years ago. Have Not had shingles and only experienced normal expected vaccine reactions. Interestingly United Health refused to pay for the first shot saying it was in a drug tier that had a high copay 250? Do Not remember exactly.. They paid for the second one. Stupid that they balk at paying for a vaccination that could save them many thousands in treatment. I do not have United Health any more. Switched to a small local HMO.
8770,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Due for my second booster soon. A bit anxious as folk here keep saying it is like getting kicked by a horse or something. My first shot was not bad just a bit sore for a week or so.
8771,These two ads are driving me insane am I the only one?: I am sorry. I have had it 3 times despite the vaccine.
8772,27F Five days ago I woke up with swelling and pain in my right temple jaw and neck. It hurt to open my mouth and chew. I also had what looked like the start of a rash on the right side of my neck as well. The ER doc said it might be the start of shingles and prescribed three days of Prednisone. I have never had Chicken Pox and have been vaccinated against it as well. I also tried Advil Tylenol Benedryl and Claritin. Nothing seems to make the pain go away but it has not gotten worse either. I brought up giant cell arteritis but they said I was too young and dismissed that quickly. Any ideas? I have an appointment with my primary care doctor but that is over two weeks from now and I am worried about waiting that long.
8773,Of all the shots we have had to take since Covid the shingles shot was the only one that I got a bump at injection site that was sore. But it was not bad at all really Good luck we all react differently and you might even not even have a reaction
8775,"Puzzling Skin Reactions and Joint Inflammation: Following my second Pfizer vaccination, I developed baffling blisters that spanned over 80% of my body. Despite medical consultations indicating shingles as the likely cause, the extensive coverage raised doubts. Alongside this, I experienced swelling in my joints, prompting me to seek further medical advice with an upcoming appointment. In a strange twist of events, a friend encountered a severe infection on her face and gums post her second Pfizer shot, leading to surgical intervention due to MRSA. Both incidents were promptly reported to the state health office, yet there has been a lack of any follow-up or investigation into these concerning reactions. These cases raise the question: Could there be a link between the immune response triggered by the vaccine and a heightened vulnerability to other infections? The absence of comprehensive data collection on such adverse events is worrisome."
8777,Shingles vaccine: First one for me was pretty bad because I had to go to work the day after I got the shot. I also got the flu and covid shot at the same time which was next level stupidity on my part. I highly recommend people NOT to do that. Second shot was not too bad compared to the first one. Either way both shots were not as bad as the mildest case of shingles.
8780,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: FATIGUE WAS MY FIRST AND BIGGEST MOST DEBILITATING SYMPTOM. Its wild a doctor can make a definitive statement then be wrong like Sir you have one job to be right about health issues. Albeit not make false statements. Sorry this stuff really bothers me. I have a second QA Shingles coming out soon in hopes to inform people and cater answers to different reactions. Mine personally was incapacitating fatigue. I Have never ever had that. I could not really get out of bed. At one point moving positions was difficult. I slept all night and all day. I was too exhausted to make any quick calls order food it was that bad.
8784,I was really worried about the Shingles vaccine but was very lucky in that I had no reaction at all. So sorry it hit you so hard
8790,Covid Vaccine Reaction and Shingrix: Yes I had some minor vibrating feelings. It would come and go. I didn t take any supplements but I did find that avoiding inflammatory foods helped me a lot. Especially junk oils. I pretty much only eat at home now and cook with extra virgin olive oil. I eat a fairly low carb diet now 75 g per day.
8791,Shingles vaccine: Covid vaccines hit me way harder than Shingrix. Shingrix was just a sore arm. I wish you the best
8792,M pox is shingles autoimmune blister disease or herpes bought on by Covid vaccine Check out photo of a vaccine person I know
8793,I hate being sick too. Unfortunately I got Covid before boosters and this strain kicked my ass. I was down for 2 weeks and I was not down that long when I had major cancer surgery. I highly recommend everyone get the booster when available. And the flu shot. And shingles if 50.
8795,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: Is that maybe another name for an ice pick headache? They are a blindingly intense headache which only lasts for a split second. When I had shingles I was getting them every few minutes for a few days. It sucked.
8797,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had a horrible rash on both my shoulder blades like the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. It was so itchy but it burned too. It was patchy and went down the backs of my arms. I swore there was something in the bed biting me. It was just me getting bit though so that did not really make sense. For 2 wks straight I stripped the bed and changed the bedding and showered every single night. That did not seem to make a difference. Finally went away on its own about 3 months later. Maybe I had shingles all along.
8801,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Shingles gave me deep electrical-zap migraine headaches that made me flinch all out of control from the random precision brain attacks. It started as a rash on my ear and scalp like poison ivy, but the painful stabs underneath became a nightmare every 10 seconds for about a month. I highly recommend the vaccine!"
8802,Shingles vaccine: Achy body mild headache really tired just wanted to lay on the couch. Like when you have the flu but before it really hits you. I drank a lot of water and did not have much of an appetite. Same way I feel if I drink too much whiskey the day before.
8803,Got my second shingles vaccine yesterday and am pretty wiped out today but as someone with a parent in the late stages of Alzheimers I Am glad it might also reduce the risk of dementia.
8806,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: 87 here too and I got shingles a couple years ago and let me tell you it is easily the most painful thing that is ever happened to me
8809,Shingles vaccine experience: Second shot was no big deal for me. YMMV.
8813,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I had shingles for the first time at about 15 and had recurrences about every year since 17 years now. Had so many doctors argue that it could not be shingles due to my age and then see it for themselves. Finally got the vaccine last year with a doctors note. I Have had one occurrence since then but I hope it can reduce the frequency
8814,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My brother got a very mild case in elementary school. He got a much worse case in junior high because the first case was so mild. The itching seemed much nastier than when I got mine at a younger age.
8816,Getting two vaccines at once: Its the shingles vaccine that is making you feel the worst its known for making you feel like you have the flugot hit by a truck for a normal person. Tdap makes your muscles sore and most doctors will recommend ibuprofen if you are able to take it. Make sure you stay hydrated
8819,Experts warn of a quaddemic as flu RSV COVID19 and norovirus converge in California: can attest that vaccine also had wayyy fewer side effects than the other vaccines for me only made me feel a little blah no knocking me out for a week like Pfizer. CVS should have it. i recommend
8821,I got shingles it sucked but not worth getting vaccine over.
8822,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Dumb doctor who never had shingles . I slept for days on end
8823,Shingles vaccine side effects: Weakness and soreness in your extremities a week after a vaccine is not normal. In rare cases this could be a sign of conditions like rhabdomyolysis or GuillainBarre syndrome. Please see a doctor AND report as an adverse event to VAERS.
8825,shingles with no rash: I had rash develop after 56 weeks my first time. The second time the rash arrived after just a few days pain but I recognized it and went straight to valcyclivor. The third time the rash was literally one innocuous pimple alternating either side of my previous rash spot for a couple of weeks before I recognized that it was shingles again.
8826,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I was at my PCP the day the vaccine was released. I brought it up and they had it. I called my insurance from the office to see if it was covered and it was. I had chickenpox in my late 20s so I definitely was keeping up with the shingles vaccine as I had just recovered from chickenpox two weeks before the chickenpox vaccine was released.
8828,I got the 1st shingle shot no problem. The second shot is a doozy though. I still think it is worth it.
8833,37F I started experiencing dry eyes last year. This year I had random muscle and joint pains in my rib area with no known because. I got sick and got numerous bloodwork and labs and everything was normal. Then I caught disseminated shingles. After my shingles healed my eyes got drier and my dry mouth and reflux started. My potentially small fiber neuropathy persisted emg brain mri normal. I failed my schrimers test but every autoimmune bloodwork including ana sed etc. are normal atm. Anyone experience this? My next step will prob be a lip biopsy. Some rheumatologists are claiming it is postviral but the dry mouth is severe and onset quickly so I am doubtful.
8835,Shingles vaccine?: Ugh yes I Am 23 and have also had it 4 times so far. Currently in an argument with my doctor about approving me for the vaccine. I cannot go through that pain again. The last time I had shingles it was along my occipital nerve that was AWFUL.
8837,Shingles at 35: Its around my eye and on my eyelid luckily but called ocular shingles because that is the nerve it affects I Am doing well nerve pain is a minimum and itching has mostly subsided. Gabapentin is honestly the least scary med I take to be honest even my dog takes it sometimes for anxiety lol. Take it if you are still in pain I was off for three weeks due to a surgery and the day I logged back in to work from home my eye was swollen shut I was so poorly lol but I Am healing so well now there is definitely hope Just treat yourself with kindness and allow yourself the time to heal
8838,RSV Vaccine for Babies: From what I understand the vaccine is incredibly expensive something like 2000 per vaccine and it is given monthly for six months so total cost is around 15000 because it has to be administered by a nurse who calls to your house. Source my son has had the vaccine through the HSE The reason it is not given to every infant is due to it not being needed. It is given to children that would be severely impacted by RSV most healthy kids will be unlikely to die if they get RSV. Children with severe respiratory or heart issues will possibly be prescribed the vaccine but not always. It is bloody painful for them too. One to two large injections into the thighs every month to help reduce the impact of RSV. I think there might be some confusion between the above vaccine and the new nasal spray coming to market soon but I do not think it is available yet. Hopefully your child will be able to get it to help reduce the risk of RSV but count yourself lucky that your child does not qualify for the current vaccine. Congratulations on the new arrival hard to not want to protect them from everything. Some edits for spelling and grammar
8846,Happy to get a robust reaction to any vaccine means the science is working. But yeah that shingles duo was intense
8850,first time experiencing shingles: Thank you for your comment Ill just have to bring it up with the doctor for my 3rd checkup. They just told me last time that my first medication was too weak and that is why the blisters have spread. Ill clarify it and maybe get a proper diagnosis if it is not just shingles.
8852,when did you realize you were old...: I am one of the lucky folks who gets recurring shingles...in my damn eyes. Now I have scarred up corneas. Never knew that was possible.
8853,"How long should I wait before taking Covid -19 vaccine after Shingles infection?: I am a healthy 55 year old, 52 kg, 5'5 Indian female with no known illnesses. I was diagnosed with Shingles on 10th April 2021. My doctor prescribed a 10 day course of anti viral drugs (Zovirax), till April 24th. How long should I wait before getting my first dose of AstraZeneca/ Covaxin vaccine?"
8854,Urgent care has no idea thinks its shingles.: sounds like hsv1 my shingles originally had tiny red bumps but they all fused into larger ones there was alot of sensation and jolts of moderatesevere pain. shingles does appear there more commonly than hsv1. but the pain is usually pretty
8859,"?? Unusual reaction to MMR vaccine ?? After receiving the MMR vaccine, I've developed these red bumps on both of my hands. They have a distinct shape and texture, sometimes causing slight discomfort. The bumps come and go unpredictably, growing in size over time. Has anyone else experienced something similar after getting this vaccine?"
8860,Shingles with PHN after: Agree pain worse than major surgery and full labor. Got my vaccine a month after I was diagnosed.
8862,Have you looked in the risk of sight loss after shingles vaccine ? Have a relative lost his sight next day after receiving it.
8863,Shingles vaccine: I got the vaccine this time. I got it at the same time as my flu shot. It was not as bad as last time. I think my reaction was just because of the flu shot. I Am glad I got the novamax
8864,23yrs AFAB nonbinary. I will list possible relevant medical information before I go on. Medications supplements 10mg Lexapro for anxiety disorders. 500mg paracetamol for daily pain. 250mg Naproxen for daily pain. 30400mg Cocodamol for severe pain. 20mg Omeprazole. Albuterol inhaler. Official diagnoses Hypermobile EhlersDanlos with CFSME. Autism. Nonallergic asthma. Unspecified widespread chronic pain. I also have a family history of autoimmune conditions as my mom has Multiple Sclerosis and other family members have Systemic Lupus Rheumatoid Arthritis Celiac Disease and likely more that I do not remember off the top of my head. It might be relevant so I am bringing it up just in case In December last year I caught COVID for the first time when traveling back to Norway after my yearly visit to my boyfriend in the states. During the time I was recovering I also ended up with a kidney infection midDecember as well as my first ever shingles outbreak in late Decemberearly January. I was never vaccinated for chickenpox my family is one of those families who took me to chickenpox parties so I contracted it around age 67 and had a miserable time understandably I had it pretty bad with blisters under my eyelids and in my urethra to name a few. Either way I was under the impression that you could only get shingles once so I was happy to be done with it. I just now came back to Norway after my usual visit in the US a few days ago and at some point during the car rides flights I developed yet another shingles outbreak as well as catching strep throat. It developed in the same spot as last time on my uh... left buttcheek right in the crack pretty much. I started getting the same pain in the same spot and I joked with my parents that it felt like I had shingles again... and yup I did. I went to the doctor a few days ago to confirm that it was indeed shingles and she said she would never personally seen anyone who has developed shingles twice much less in the short span that I have. She got a coworker to come in and look as well who was equally confused took a small swab sample to send in for analysis. I was then given antiviral medication Valtrex to keep the rash from developing further antibiotics for my strep throat Penicillin as well as being given the offer to be vaccinated Shingrix once I would recovered. I was told that this is usually not given to people my age but I fall under the criteria of someone at risk for developing it multiple times or experiencing complications. What causes someone to develop shingles multiple times in only 6 months?? I did some reading and saw that it is considered rare for shingles to break out multiple times but could not find a because for reactivation. Would Shingrix really prevent this from happening again? Like I said my family and I were under the impression that if you had shingles once you pretty much do not need to worry about it again. Is there something about me traveling that causes shingles to reactivate? I really cannot say I positively know the state of my immune system but I am definitely catching SOMETHING anytime I travel. My parents also travel with me my mom 44 has Multiple Sclerosis as mentioned and is on Rituximab causing her to have absolutely no immune system whatsoever. She has never once gotten sick from traveling alongside me despite coming into contact with things and using the restroom many more times than me. The only difference I can think of is that I need wheelchair assistance during our stays at the airport and thus I am in physical contact with airport assistance personell. Thanks
8865,GenX Shingrix: When I got my shingles vaccine I was told 6 months apart. Considering how sick I was from the first it was good to have them spaced apart.
8868,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Ugg sorry! My best friend had no reaction to either shot- so it can be totally random. So I wish that for you, maybe just be prepared and take a couple days off just in case. Stock up on ice cream and tylenol."
8871,Shingles vaccine: Took both and no issues. A friend got it in his eye vision has never been the same. Another older lady friend got it in her vagina She said the pain was off the charts. Shingles does not go away quickly either. Definitely get the shots. I was 60 when it got them.
8881,"Face shingles - tooth sensitivity?: Hi all, Can see my post history for more details but initial shingle symptoms started left side of face 8 days ago. 6 days later, entire top row of teeth became sensitive. Anything which isn't warm causes pain along with the slightest movement in the air. I have never had issues with sensitive teeth (I have no fillings/cavities and at my regular checkups my dentist says teeth are in perfect condition). I've been given carbamazepine. Anyone else have experience with this? It's an additional misery on top of having shingles from my temple to my mouth."
8884,Put me out of my misery.: Yes the shot can be painful but the pain of actual SHINGLES is far worse. I would not wish it on my worst enemy.
8886,RSV after maternal vaccine: The vaccine is doing its job keeping it from resulting in hospitalization. Mine just had some congestion so I made sure to saline and suck it out every day and he was good after about 4 days
8888,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it in my late 40s a few years ago now. cannot remember exactly my age but it was right around my birthday. Got me on my forehead. Have deffo had the shingles vaccine now. Not interested in a repeat bout of shingles if I can avoid it.
8889,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I missed the childhood party but got the fullblown chicken pox in my late twenties. That was horrific.
8891,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Same happened to me....first one was three days of being sick, second one just extra tired and a sore arm. And the pharmacist warned me the second would be worse."
8892,Hello I am 28F and had been on the pill for about 10 years on and off so maybe 7 years overall. I was put on the pill at 17 due to irregular periods and did not look back. Fast forward to November 2023 I had a colposcopy appointment due to abnormal cells found during my annual pap smear. Not all colposcopies require a biopsy but after they put in the vinegar solution they found that I needed one. They took a biopsy and I was later told that the cells were not cancerous. I was a bit confused on why I would have a cervical cancer scare and so I looked up causes for it and lo and behold birth control pills are a leading because. It is March 2024 my husband and I went on holiday and realized I forgot to pack my BECAUSE pills. We already had talks of me getting off the pill because I had been on it for so long and we thought that this was the perfect timing to just pull the trigger and get off the pill. I chose to go the Natural Cycles route since I was in a position to do so haha I do not recommend the risk if you are not and if anyone is curious it is been almost a year since I have been using Natural Cycles and following the instructions and I have not gotten pregnant Anyways getting off the pill though was a crazy rollercoaster ride. I am 5'1 and was about 120 pounds but after I got off the pill I gained about 2025 pounds in such a short amount of time hair started thinning got more facial fuzz my skin was at an all time low I have no appetite bloated constantly super nauseous etc. I did not change any eating habits for me to gain that much weight I do not eat a lot and if anything I was moving around more but my body was showing the opposite. All of that made me think I might have had PCOS this whole time and the BECAUSE pills were masking all my symptoms. August 2024 I am going through all these body changes since getting off the pill but then I start to feel physical pain. One morning I let out a big stretch when I woke up and all of a sudden I felt a pressure right over my right ovary and it felt as if it was going to pop inside of me or something. That was a one off which made me feel weird but again I just thought it was a one off. Note I just moved to a new country so my healthcare coverage was still in process so I did not have access to hospitals without getting a fat bill. September 2024 I got shingles... I am 28 years old and have had no health complications before this and your girl got freaking shingles. Shingles at my age pretty much indicates my immune system is not doing so good due to stress depression fatigue etc. I was not able to ask a doctor about it but just got antibiotics over at a pharmacy next to a walkin clinic. But on top of the shingles I started to get stabbing pains in my pelvic area. It would start on my right ovary to my hip to my back. I also started to get such terrible period pains. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but these period pains were something else to the point that I had to lie down in bed and wait it out and not be able to do anything else. I also passed out from the pain. October 2024 I am now getting stabbing pains in my stomach and pelvic area way more often. I am cramping outside of my period or week before period it is just non stop at this point. I have found blood outside of my period fresh bright blood as well as dark purpley discharge at different times. I also started to get referred pain where it was not just my pelvic area getting stabbing achey pains but it would shoot down my thigh to my knee. Also again crazyyyyy period pains where I have to lay down and cannot move. At this point it is obvious there are health issues and it is not a one off but we simply just cannot afford going to a hospital and racking up a big bill. I read online a lot of the times they just send you away without helping you so I made a judgement call to just wait it out as I was very close to getting my healthcare coverage. But yeah now I am thinking it might not just be PCOS but this could be endometriosis. November 2024 I am continuing on with the pain and using THC capsules for pain management until my healthcare coverage could kick in also do not worry THC is legal where I am at. But one night I notice something on my skin and my husband tells me it is petechiae and we need to go to the ER immediately. He said that it could mean nothing or something super serious petechiae might indicate that something is going on regarding infection or immune system. Before we were willing to wait it out thinking the doctors will not be able to help us much anyways in that moment if it is PCOS or endometriosis but now we were thinking it potentially could be cancer. We go to the ER and I was luckily given a very kind doctor and she was very attentive to all my symptoms. We did an intense pelvic exam speculum pap smear and then she moved onto a different exam where she reached into my cervix with one hand and her other hand on top of my stomach womb area pressing down to feel for any masses we did a transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan. FOUND NOTHING.... She was really sad to give me the news and referred me to a OBGYN specialist. She said that she had a chat with the OBGYN doctor and they have an inkling that I might have endometriosis. They could not help me with much except saying keep doing what you are doing I did mention I have been taking THC capsules for pain management and they were like nice haha so I guess that is what she meant with just keep managing my pain the way I have been. She also said if the pain gets bad again to come back because sometimes things do not show up the first time around. The hospital bill ended up being 5k but the social worker at the hospital called health care services and told me that I should have been covered but they were too slow with my paperwork so it is not on me and I will not need to pay the bill even though we received one. I cried out of relief lol. December 2024 I am just living that THC life and my symptoms seem to be way more mild. I have now started to gaslight myself into thinking that I might have made up everything and that is why they could not find anything. Maybe I just needed to ride it out and it would have ran it is course. Jan 2025 I stopped taking THC capsules for a week now and all my symptoms came back. Stabbing pains in my pelvic area back pains referred pain down my right leg to my knee constantly nauseous hard to eat food often back pain really painful periods etc. My OBGYN appointment I was referred to by the ER doctor is on Jan 10th. I am now trying to remind myself to not gaslight myself. I do not know why but I am just worried I will go into the appointment and they will tell me there has been nothing wrong and it is just normal woman pains. Or again that there is nothing that they could find and I must have made it all up in my head. Did people who got diagnosed with endo on this thread have a similar experience symptoms as me? Is it wrong of me to think I might have endo? Do you have any advice of how to advocate for myself? What should I push for in this upcoming appointment? If you read all that thank you so much and any advice would be really helpful Thanks again
8893,Put me out of my misery.: The second is the worst. It was pretty awful for me but I absolutely do not want shingles. Everyone I Have known who had it thought it was hell.
8894,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am a younger millennial and when I went to kindergarten my class was the first that was required the chickenpox vaccine it had been optional for the first several years it was available.
8895,Am I safe to get more vaccines  side effects: I appreciate all bodies are different. That being said in my experience the RSV vaccine has been much milder than the whooping cough one.
8897,I Am three weeks in and have not lost a single ounce. The scale is holding steady. I have side affects of exhaustion and nausea day of injection with nausea through the week. I have good appetite suppression and have cut down on food at roughly 12001300 cal trying to increase protein. I only drink water and a black coffee or iced tea once a day and have for years. I am currently at .25 now and increase next week. I know everyone is different. Did it take others several weeks to see a loss for anyone else?
8902,Shingles shot: Mother had it on her face at 55. Here we are 20 years later and she still has nerve damage and pain in her right cheek. I begged and received the vaccine before I was 50.
8903,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I had shingles. Fucking sucked and destroyed my cornea. Get the vaccine
8905,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It's rough, was a dummy and got the first shingle shot and the Covid booster, lol MISTAKE."
8906,All they did was give me the fact sheet: My 3 year old nephew got RSV at preschool last week huge outbreak and hes ridiculously sick and had to be admitted to the childrens hospital. My SIL got the RSV vaccine while pregnant with her youngest who is about 6 months old and they all have tested positive but my younger nephew is barely symptomatic. Even my brother is pretty sick with it but my SIL and the baby are thankfully doing really well. I almost brought my 3 year old daughter over for a play date right when he would have been starting to become contagious and did not at the last minute because I had a cough and did not want to possibly infect the baby with something. And then I got induced at 384 for pregnancy induced hypertension on Sunday and had my baby early Monday AM and I Am so thankful we did not end up going over there and possibly getting RSV right before I gave birth though I did get the RSV vaccine shortly before being induced but my older daughter has not been vaccinated yet I guess they are not offering it to her age group yet unless they are at an elevated risk?
8908,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: Me too no reaction to either dose.
8911,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: I know too many horror stories about getting shingles. My vaccine experience sucked but it was better than the horrible experiences I have seen with friends and family. I even know someone that has permanent facial paralysis due to getting shingles.
8917,Hey you all I Am the booty hole shingles girl. Mostly helped. But the night time itching is crazy. Sometimes is so intense that I cannot sleep. What do you all do to help.
8918,Shingles and PHN Experience: Thanks for this information. Very helpful. I Am at week 3 after having shingles which turned out to be the Ramsey hunt syndrome kind in my ear. I Am feeling better but still some pain and I Am down to300mg of gabapentin was at 900 mg per day 2 weeks ago. I Am sleeping better but still not out of the woods. I have followup appointments with doctors. I heard mixed reviews about acupuncture but am curious. Might try it if not too pricey. Does anyone know if an ocobaric oxygen chamber is helpful? My doctor is recommending it but I do not know much about it.
8920,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: Absolutely not. I know someone who periodically needs to have her skull drained of excess fluid because of the HPV vaccine. They almost died after taking it due to fluid build up around her brains. I stupidly took it as an adult at 36 and have had autoimmune issues ever since.
8924,33m Hi I just kind of want to scream into the void. About a month ago I chipped a tooth and had to get it removed then I battled dry socket for about 2weeks. And the first day after not having dry socket pain my entire right side of face including my eyelid swelled up. That night I found myself in urgent care because my eye was almost swollen shut. The doc came in said it is shingles then left. With no real info on what to do or what to avoid I have been googling and scared of the horror stories I have heard. I think I am lucky because I have had shingles for maybe at most a week and a half and I am already scabbing over but that seems super early from all the timelines I read online and that scares me that another shoe is going to drop and it is going to get worse. Luckilyor unluckily depending on your view point I have pretty bad nerve damage in my leg so I am on a high dose of gabapentin but man this pain even through the gabapentin is something i was not prepared for. I spend most of the day with an ice pack glued to me. Anyway I just wanted to scream where people would understand. Thank you for reading.
8929,I finally took that step and ordered my Sad be. IT s schedule to arrive hopefully this week. I have been suffering for almost a year of symptoms. Nerve pain outbreaks after outbreaks. Near suicide attempts because I felt hopeless. I have tried everything. Nothing work. I started my herbal remedies and they have brought me some relief. My question is can I still drink my herbal teas? I also take vitamins. Can I still can my vitamins? I got the shingles vaccine because I was told I had shingles and not herpes. Got tested and I tested positive for herpes HSV 12. So I am praying Sad be will work for me. I m at my end of things to try Thank you For your feed back
8930,Coffee With Texas Paul 53124 Trump Convicted On All Counts Why and what now.: I never had any vaccine hurt the way the shingles shots did but I did it and I am protected too.
8934,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My little guy got it at 3 weeks. We did not have any discernable reactions to it.
8936,"Shingles outbreak one after another!: I got my first shingles outbreak 10 days after my first moderna shot. The blisters dried up two weeks or so ago. I gave myself another week as a precaution and scheduled my 2nd shot for this Friday. But two days ago, I felt pain in the same spots I had shingles before and lo and behold new blisters were coming up. Confirmed by my doc yesterday. This sucks major! Idk if I even want the second shot cuz I feel sure as shit I'm gonna get it again. I do have plaque psoriasis and have been taking those topical steroid creams for years. Post shingles diagnosis I had been eating fairly healthy and taking vitamin D3 and C supplements regularly. Apparently none of that mattered :( Anyone else had a similar experience?"
8937,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My children both received the Chicken Pox vaccine and still got chicken pox. My son actually caught it twice a mild case in 2nd grade then a fullblown case in 4th grade. My daughter got chicken pox when my son caught it the 2nd time. When I was a child both my younger brothers got chicken pox but I never got it. Years after my children had chicken pox I got shingles.
8938,Got my Shingles vaccine: I had both shots. No problem at all. Except for the poke in the arm it was as if nothing had happened. Same for my husband.
8939,Hi all. I F37 have V1 shingles on my right side. Not immunocompromised as far as I know although I had a pretty bad bilateral ear infection supposedly from a virus that took about a month to heal and then lingering bronchitis for about a week leading up to this so maybe that stressed my immune system? Not particularly stressed out right now although I have generalized anxiety treatedmanaged so I am always kind of stressed and the ear infection was sort of stressful. But did not feel notably stressed leading up to this. Tomorrow Friday I will be three weeks out from first symptoms. Tuesday night I started having zappy feelings on my left forehead near my hairline and then last night Wednesday my left eyebrow had zappy pains. Both were similar to how the pain started in my right side. I do not have any sores on the left side so I am hoping it is just referred pain or something but it is freaking me out Seems like everything should be limited to one side. Has anyone had radiating pain while healing in the other side of the same dermatome or gotten another outbreak soon after stopping antivirals? Symptom history Started on a Friday near the middle of my foreheadhairline and felt like one hair was being pulled every few minutes. Next day Saturday I had a rash there which I thought was contact dermatitis in the center but mostly to the right. Two days later Monday had serious pain in front on my right ear and zappy feeling when I touched the outer end of my right eyebrow. Went to urgent care and was diagnosed with shingles and given 1000 mg valtrex 2x a day for 7 days just within 72 hours of first sore. Told to take Aleve and Tylenol for pain and Benadryl if itchy and to use calamine or topical Benadryl on sores. Pain seemed to get better but sores continued to pop up on my face and scalp on the right V1 dermatome. Went to opthalmologist on thursday to check stuff out and he said my eye was ok but should go back to PCP and get higher dose of valtrex 1000 mg 3x daily since I was still getting new sores. Went to doctor next day Friday and they upped my dosage and extended the course to 10 days which I finished one week ago. As most of my scabs had started coming off by then I switched to topical lidocaine for the painzaps. Throughout this I have not felt horrible mostly tired and zappyitchy with limited pain if I over did it. I have tried very hard to rest and relax and manage nerve symptoms so I do not get PHN. Work has been great and basically let me WFH when I felt up to it. I worked about 2 hrs a day wk 1 half days wk 2 and most of the day mw this week but still sleeping 1012 hrs a night. Two nights ago the zappy feeling on the left started on forehead and then last night on eyebrow... Today I am very tired and the healing sore on the right feels zappy like they have been feeling and my left eyebrow feels kind of heavyswollen but not zappy and I do not have any sores on that side. Maybe I should not have gone back to basically full time so fast? I do not see any sores on the left which makes me feel better even though it feels off. Hoping this is not too unusual? Has anyone else had an experience like this? Should I go back to the doctor? Thanks for the insight and support This group convinced me that I probably had shingles and got me to go get the antivirals within 72 hours I had no clue I could get shingles this young and I totally would have waiting it out longer without the info I saw here TLDR healing on right V1 dermatome after three weeks but now having similar nerve zaps on left side V1 and wondering if this has happened to anyone else.
8941,Response when asked if HPV vaccine should be taken.: i have epilepsy  everyone in my family is convinced i got it from the HPV vaccine completely ignoring the fact that i had it years before i ever actually got the vaccine..but either way ill take my epilepsy over cervical cancer thanks
8942,About 6 years ago when my ME CFS was still mild I had a mild ish still very painful bout of shingles that lasted about 56 weeks. It was over the winter holidays and I did not have a family doctor at the time so I did not end up taking anything for it. I have woken up the last two nights with shingles symptoms in the exact same spot as my last infection. My doctor prescribed me fa mci clo vi r and told me to wait to take it until a proper rash occurs right now there is nothing visible to show for it. 1. Anyone else here feel predisposed to shingles? I am only 32 so I am feeling quite like ME CFS is to blame here and it would probably make sense seeing as viral reactivation is so common for us. 2. Can anyone tell me about their experience with fa mci clo vi r? I have been trying to research antivirals in relation to ME CFS but it is new territory for me. 3. Has anyone had the shingles vaccine and how did it go? I probably should have gotten it after the last bout but I was hoping it was a fluke.
8943,Shingles vaccine experience: I had it about 10 years ago and it was unremarkable. I had four others along with it had no issues except some sore biceps for a day or so.
8946,First shingles vaccine side effects: Just remember that its still so much better than getting shingles But yeah its the only vaccine that really had an effect on me. Was wiped out

8949,Shingles: Thank you for your question. My dose was increased because I had not lost any weight. I actually gained 2 lbs at the end of two complete weeks 14 days Other than the nerve pain that developed in week 2 which was deemed to be unrelated I had zero side effects. My appetite was not really affected although there was a bit of a difference in food noise. For these reasons my provider felt an early increase was warranted. Our plan was for me to remain at the next dosage longer than usual before increasing againno matter the outcome. It made sense to me In hindsight whatever was happening at the lowest dose was the precursor to full blown shingles. The unknown is was it triggered by the introduction of semaglutide. I have read of others having the same reaction so there seems to be a possible correlation. My reason for posting was to see if I could connect with someone who had the same experience.

8961,Second Shingles Shot: Yes I am 57 and had chickenpox the summer when I was 14 however as an adult you are still vulnerable to shingles which nobody wants. Do yourself a favor and get vaccinated. Unlike OP I had a really rough reaction perhaps because they also gave me a Covid booster at the same visit but some people just shrug it off. Bottomline get the shingles vaccine

8978,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles when I was 39 or 40. It was miserable it was on my butt waist and upper thigh. I could not sit for weeks sleeping on my back was not possible and even the sheet on my back side when stomach sleeping hurt a lot just wearing pants or underwear hurt. Urgent Care doc said it was the misery severe case they would seen. The wife had it in her 20s but it was mild and long lasting was misdiagnosed as a rash at first mostly was itchy for her but it lasted months.
8980,"35[F] experienced rash after receiving first Moderna shot: Sharing my story to raise awareness. About 12 days after getting my first Moderna vaccine, I noticed a rash starting on the left side of my forehead. The bumps were painless and seemed quite large, initially resembling acne. I tried treating it with skincare products assuming it was stress-related, but when the bumps didn't improve, my family encouraged me to seek medical advice. Upon visiting urgent care on the fourth day of symptoms, the doctor diagnosed me with shingles due to the linear pattern of the rash and the presence of scabs. Interestingly, she mentioned that she had seen similar cases in individuals who recently received the COVID vaccine. I was prescribed medication and thankfully, I didn't experience much pain or itching, but the appearance of the rash was a concern for me, especially in a professional setting. I also noticed a small blister on my eyelid and occasional itching near my eye, prompting me to schedule an appointment with an optometrist for a check-up. The urgent care doctor recommended applying Neosporin to the sores to prevent scarring. Has anyone else dealt with shingles post-vaccine and have tips on minimizing scarring? Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Tldr; Developed a rash on my forehead after first Moderna shot, diagnosed with shingles. Seeking advice on managing the appearance and potential scarring, as well as eye-related symptoms post-vaccine."
8981,Oh dear. Wishing you a faster recovery. Was it Shingrix or tetanus by any chance? 1 of the 2 Shingrix was a doozy for me but my last tetanus vaccine was way easier I drink lots of water preshot. Shortterm pain longterm gain.
8986,Booty hole Shingles: Hi there sorry to hear you are going through this. I Am 35M and had genital shingles in November all on left side starting from tip of penis down the shaft cradled balls and wrapped up inner butt cheek to tailbone. Was the worst experience I Have ever had to go through and still dealing with PHN. I had to take ice cold showers and just hold the shower head to cool my skin. I got to the point where I bought a toilet seat bidet for cleaning and cooling. Was taking hyrdo morphine and Lyrica for the pain. Currently still taking the Lyrica. Lidocaine cream was out of the question because it would because worse burning pain because of the sensitive skin.
8987,My mother had Covid 4 times then pneumonia then shingles now POTS. Yes she was vaccinated but she also takes no other precautions and after 4 times w Covid the immune dysregulation is real. Vaccines can only do so much against aggressive apathy.
8989,Please be cautious shingles is still a thing: As others said shingles typically occurs with the elderly so vaccines are mostly reserved for a later age. It can also only occur when you have already had the chicken pox basically once you have had chicken pox it lingers dormant in your nervous system. Then when your immune system gets weak you may get outbursts again which is shingles. That also means that you may get it when you are younger when your immune system has gotten a beating caused by illness but also by stress. Source I'n in my early 30s and just had it last month caused by stress. It does not look pretty and it itches like hell. But it will heal just fine. Just take care of yourself sleep drink a lot of water eat well and try to move a bit like going for a walk every day or two.
8993,CA Pharmacists How Is life without metrics?: You can recommend it to people under 50 on mtx or other immunosuppressive therapy or on HIV treatment not PREP. Idgaf about corporate agendas but I just had shingles at 32 and it suxxx. I would have taken the vaccine in a heartbeat if I was indicated. I also always recommend PCV20 to people who smoke or who are picking up NRT. You could also recommend it to people picking up Librium or disulfiram. A lot of people are receptive to it if you phrase it tactfully. Hey it seems like you might have some risk factors for more severe pneumococcal infections. Not just pneumonia but strep throat sinus infections ear infections etc. I believe the vaccine is free with your insurance. I can do it for you now.
8995,Shingles vaccine: Agreed it crawls down your head can get to your eye scarring your cornea with pseudodendrites can fry nerves that remain painful years after the infection. I treat Zoster I ran down for my Shingrix vaccine. I could not care less that I felt poorly 12 hours. You Are trading mild flu symptoms for 12 hours to avoid absolute hell.
9005,"Navigating uncertainty after possible vaccine reaction and low grade lymphoma scare: Seeking support and guidance. Following a shingles vaccine, a 68-year-old male experienced alarming symptoms including swollen lymph nodes and stomach pain. Despite no prior history of cancer and normal blood tests, subsequent imaging revealed enlarged lymph nodes and a potential diagnosis of low grade lymphoma. With conflicting opinions from healthcare professionals about the next steps, the individual is feeling scared and unsure about how to proceed. What advice would you offer to someone facing a similar situation? How can one find clarity and peace of mind amidst the fear of a possible cancer diagnosis? Your support and wisdom are welcome during this challenging time."
9007,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Thought I had some bad bug bites late in the summer. Nope Shingles a long my waist line so pants rubbed every time I moved. Incredibly painful and it seemed to wear me down in general having them. Still have marks from them that do not seem to be fading.
9015,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I picked up the herpes virus that causes cold sores a few years ago by accidentally switching drinks at a work party. The stupid sore came back for the first time this winter after I had a flu virus and my immune system was in the dumps. So i had fun learning that a new infection can because a dormant viruse to emerge. Now everytime I get sick with something I am going to worry about hsv and shingles coming out. Viruses suck.
9016,Shingles vaccine: My wife had it. It did not look all bad but the pain seemed awful. One of those things that is worse than it looks.
9019,I have had Shingles and Ramsay Hunt Syndrome for 21 days. I was only diagnosed 5 days ago by an ENT. However I saw the same doctor 2x at urgent care and 1 new dr at an er who all did not 1prescribe me antivirals despite seeing the shingles rash on my face they thought it was cold sores that had caused sudden hearing loss and also then accidentally prescribed me 7 days of high dose prednisone instead of the full 10 day course so I had 3 days of no prednisone before starting another 3 day course after going more deaf in my right ear and EXCRUCIATING pain that makes me pass out and vomit. I am livid. Does this feel like negligence? I have potentially permanently lost a moderate amount of hearing in my right ear and I have been in immense pain and missed out on a bunch of important things in my life grad school and my TAships right now for example. All because I was not prescribed valtrex or prednisone correctly. If I were to sue it would be for the hearing damage mostly and lost wage because I do not want to have to involve my entire medical history including psychiatric. I do not feel emotional distress I am mainly like what the hell??? My hearing is gone??? I Do Not Know if I should pursue this. I am venting I guess. Does this sound like negligence? ETA I have also developed severe vertigo from the shingles which means I need to stay home most of the time for the time being. Sucks.
9020,Shingles vaccine experience: Had shingles 010 do not recommend. I barely remember the shots sure as heck remember the shingles.
9023,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Omg that is awful Definitely check Not that it matters but just curious science is cool but terrible about when you had your experience with the presumed internal shingles I did not even know that was a thing the thing that confirmed it on sight for my doc was that the rash for shingles is only on one side of the body. Mine was in a spot near my spine and it was crazy seeing how it just did not go over that line. Was it only one side of your body with the nerve pain and such?
9026,Seeking guidance after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. I experienced some fatigue and body aches after getting the shot. Is this normal? Would love to hear others' experiences with this vaccine.
9032,Shingles vaccine experience: My dad ended up with shingles in his stomach. Put him in the hospital for a week. Maybe the shot is not so bad....
9036,Shingles vaccine: I got the shot when my insurance changed and it was covered. My arm ached for three days. It is been nine years and there is no shingles or other side effects. My cousin got shingles and I would not wish that on anybody.
9038,40M 176 lb 510.5 in ADHD Takes Adderall 20 mg twice daily Currently has shingles face and is taking Valtrex 1000 mg three times a day. Had first dose last night in the ER and three doses today. We were not told he had to drink a lot of water but I discovered it after dose 2 and made sure he started drinking a lot. Today he had between 34 bottles of water about 48 to 64 ounces of water. He continued to take his Adderall as usual. I just saw that Adderall can dehydrate you. Can he continue to take Adderall with this dose of Valtrex? Should he lower the dose of Adderall? Should he increase his water intake even more to offset the Adderall? Any other precautions?
9039,UPDATE I regret to announce my wife of 23 years passed away on 11272024 at 440am. Now that I Have mourned her everyday since the diagnosis I can tell you what they DO NOT tell you once you get the diagnosis. Ill start with her death and what we know and mainly other than overwhelming grief I Am madder than hell and I absolutely do not know how or what to do about it. If you read my initial post we stumbled into finding this monster that hides in plain site. I call it a monster because its what we all fear something that lurks and will steal you away in the night no matter what you throw at it. I will refer to her condition as trying to contain the monster . Once we did Chemo my wife thrived and it did its thing. The tumors retreated by 10 bile ducts were not blocked and her liver function was normal via bloodwork. If you have cholangiocarcinoma you want to pay attention here. Once off the chemo and the immunotherapy combo they recommended for one solid year of good scans headed in right direction they decided to try immunotherapy alone. Just doing basic research there has been zero studies showing that immunotherapy was effective by itself. Only thing effective is targeted treatment that works but you cannot get that unless first line treatment fails. This is when we should have sought out national experts and forget the local idiots. My wife who liked our oncologist did not think it was necessarily needed. Fast forward to March when after 3 months of immunotherapy the tumors crept over her bile ducts and caused the bile to creep thru her skin causing her to itch for weeks on end until her liver function almost caused jaundice they decided to do ERCP bile stentsduct bypass and she did that and it worked. Dr who performed that surgery was supposed to check up with her every 90 days. That did not happen. After her ERCP they decided to try radiation therapy for 5 weeks from April to May. VERY IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE GOING UNDER RADIOTHERAPY OR RADIATION IF YOU HAD CHICKENPOX AS A CHILD DO NOT DO RADIATION WITH GETTING AN ANTI VIRAL MEDICATION TO PREVENT SHINGLES. This is where our story goes off the rails and basically lead to her soul being broken. After her last week of radiation she had thought she had pulled a muscle in her mid back because of the pain. Turns out the biggest case of shingles any of the doctors or nurses had seen shows up on a Friday over Memorial Day weekend to where we could not get medication until Tuesday. By that time it covered her upper left side of her back and shoulder blade followed her bra line under her breast to the midpoint of her chest. So to get any relief she had to lay on the opposite side to sleep then go shirtless for nearly 4 months of isolation in bed because the nerve pain had spread all over her body. It hurt to move we went to wound care specialists who removed all the scabs etc and coated her with Vaseline to keep infection down. We had to do this daily and modify clothing but cutting out the parts that would touch her shingles. One week into all this she developed Bells Palsy on her face which caused her to droop on the right side on her face and lose her sense of taste. Then after suffering this life for nearly the entire summer after getting the wounds to heal somewhat the nerve pain stayed as a parting gift. So starting in August her feet started going numb on a Thursday then went to her thighs. We went to hospital and our local hospital did not have a neurologist so they sent us across town to another hospital. Told them she had shingles etc and this seemed like GBS Guianne Barre SyndromeThis is a Friday first consult was set for Monday but by Monday morning her numbness had spread from her thighs to her hands to where she could not hold a fork they thought she was having a stroke because she could not use her hands sent her for CT scan to verify it was not a stroke neurologist comes in says we need to consult with a neurosurgeon then neurosurgeon says its not his problem but neurologist says it was. This went on for 3 days while my wife gets worse. Finally I contacted a friend who is in the administration there told them wtf was happening somehow they got the neurologist to actually do the test for GuillaneBarre  which was what we had told them from Day 1. Test came back positive for protein in spinal fluid she started treatment for GBS that night and 3 days later was able to walk. She was sooo weak they sent her to a physical rehab center for 6 weeks. After all that she was still to weak from the GBS and nerve pain to walk without a walker. She comes home in October and basically from October until November she is able to get around ok  still in pain taking loads of GABA Pentin and Progesterone. On Nov 26th she woke up ill she thought from food poisoning Was up all night throwing up and diarrhea etc. She did crackers bread water etc pedialyte. I stayed home til noon until she thought she was good to get around by herself etc. Nothing out of ordinary. I got home at 5 and she was still snoring but in a weird breathing pattern. I went to wake her up and her skin was clammy. I woke her up and she was in a weird dream state. I took her temp with a laser temp and it read 94.5 degrees. She became unresponsive although she was still snoring. I could not get her awake and dialed 911. Once paramedics arrived they asked me if she was a diabetic and I said no they said her blood sugar was at 13.they gave her glucagon and it shot up to 360 which means something is way wrong. They rushed her to nearby hospital and her BP was 13070 and blood oxygen was 98 and pulse was 75 and they said she was in a diabetic coma. They took her to a CT scan and did blood work and bloodwork indicated a major infection. The ER doc took me aside and said it looked like one or both of her ERCP stents had gotten infected and started necrosis in her liver and she is in the throes of Sepsis and her organs are failing and she had about 2 hrs before cardiac arrest. He told me to call all my loved ones and bring the family to get because she was slowly dying. They had placed her on a vent and gave her pain meds to slow the process until everyone was there. So myself  my 3 kids boys 20 16 and daughter 15 my wifes mom dad brother and sister and their kids got to watch her slip away peacefully from 3am until her heart quit beating at 440am after he blood pressure stop registering. It was as devastating and painful as we initially thought this would be a routine visit and we could live with the diabetes if that was as the issue. We had ZERO idea nor did my wife that she was ill from infection and was septic. Has ZERO clue. We were slated to start targeted therapy on Dec 2nd. Her first follow up for the stents was supposed to be Dec 2nd also. So you can imagine the misery we watched her suffer during the summer to fight everything BUT the cancer to be basically killed by the stents that no one had any clue about. Her blood panel from 1122 was perfect so we are left with more questions than answers and I Am a widow at 54 my kids lost their mother as teenagers and her mom and dad want to hire attorneys. My only silver lining is that she did not suffer at all and she did not deserve any of this especially the damn shingles and all it brought on her mentally and physically. Who knew that chemo was the EASIEST part of our entire journey. I wish wed gotten away from this idiots here and went to Houston or NYC or whoever knows wth they are doing. And damn sure wished the radiation dept and oncologists actually cared about their patients. A simple antiviral medication prevents about 5 months of living hell to go thru it and have her die of a damn infection no one knew about is BS. Its like they squeezed her medical insurance for all they had then put her out like trash. I Am over this entire racket. You are basically on your own and if you do not feel you are getting the correct treatment get another opinion.
9048,Oh no. Sorry. Not my experience. I woke twice during the night with the sweats but that was the end of it besides a sore arm. Strange how we have such different symptoms. But good to have Shingrix on board.
9053,Shingles Sucks: The second shot affected me more than the first.
9054,hi everyone currently visiting my grandma 76 in Pakistan due to some health issues she had earlier this month. i believe she has PostHerpetic Neuralgia and have learned that Pakistan does not have the shingles vaccine. doctors here are playing ping pong by sending her to random specialists. i recommended sending her to a neurologist. this neurologist says that they cannot see anything in the MRI. hearing my grandmother crying and screaming from a shooting pain how she describes it that is on the left side of her face genuinely breaks my heart. i have been sitting with her throughout the day and placing a cold gel pad on the area. i really would appreciate some pointers or advice to make it easier for her. my winter break ends soon so ill have to go back to the states but my parents will still be here to support her. thank you 
9056,I did ok with the shingles vaccine but I Have heard from my friends that it knocked them for a loop.
9057,41 and got Shingles: I lucked out and got the vaccine in my teens
9065,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got my two doses at 50. So glad I did. My friend had shingles and it was hell for him.
9068,No. I took the first two COVID shots and have had COVID 3 times within 6 months. I have taken the shingles and tetanus but I will never take an mRNA short cut vaccine again.
9072,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: 49 with auto immune issues. Just finished the second dose. My father had it on his face near his eye. No thank you
9079,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My husband got chicken pox as an infant thanks to a chicken pox party and developed shingles the next time he got exposed to the virus at 8 years old. He almost died was in the pediatric ICU for 2 weeks. Has scars all over his body. I would also be livid if I were OOP and would never be able to talk to or even think of MIL again.
9082,I 30yr old female I Am sick I have a bad headache and cold symptoms and have a 32 week preemie that is a month and a half adjusted. Hes scheduled for the RSV antibody shot next week was the earliest they can get him in since hes came home from the nicu.i am wearing a mask and washing my hands and using hand sanitizer to the point my hands are damn near peeling. I Am so worried my LO is going to end up sick. I Have had the flu shot and TDAP while pregnant and actually was sick with Covid while pregnant and hes got his first round of vaccines just not the RSV yet since our pediatrician does not have it. I did not get the RSV shot pregnant because I was not planning on delivering early..I have not gone anywhere but the grocery store once or twice and the pediatricians office and around my mother in law who was not sick. I Am so worried my baby is going to get sick and die. Why did I even leave the house to go to the store? I Am never going to forgive myself if he does get sick. What should I watch for in my baby? Should I take him to the ER at the first sign of a fever?
9086,Shingles vaccine experience: I went and got that vaccine the day I turned 50. Other than a typical sore arm I was fine. No way I was messing with shingles  I knew a guy who got it near his eyes. Awful.
9087,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I was 40 with shingles and now 50 got both vaccines bcuz that crap was awful
9091,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: I went back after 2 months and here 3 years later I am battling my 2nd bout. Last one was on my lower butt cheek this one is inside both cheeks. 4th dose of Valtrex will be tonight. Hubby said they are almost to the scabbing over stage. Last bout was mild and maybe a week long.
9095,Of course everyone is different but with the Shingrix twoshot series I only had some soreness around the injection site. I had witnessed a friend have shingles and was not interested in replicating his experience Good luck with whatever you decide
9096,Bout of shingles after getting the shot?: Yup got it after my 4th COVID booster.
9097,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My grandma had really severe shingles that left some memory issues and I think maybe some other nerve problems but I cannot remember so she insisted I got the vaccine I was the only sibling young enough at the time it came out to have not gotten it yet. Now she hounds all the adults on whether they got their vaccinebooster yet this year I think the shingles vaccine starts around age 50ish? Beyond the fact I cannot imagine purposefully infecting someone anyways she has definitely put the fear into the entire family about how dangerous chicken pox can become since especially at that time it would have had the same innocent thing and the parties were definitely common back then. Plus I do not know if it is true or not but there is at least the idea going around that it is more mild for young kids hence the parties to expose them when younger as getting when teenadult is worse
9099,Put me out of my misery.: Mine were not too bad but my wife had shingles so I got my shots without hesitation.
9100,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Yep went through that this year. I did not know the first time it would make me sick so I just planned ahead for the second one.
9104,I got both Shingles doses. No side effects. I never have any vaccine issues except sore arm for flu shot.
9105,"""Possible side effects from Pfizer booster? (30M) After receiving my Pfizer booster shot last week, I've been experiencing intense headaches and fatigue. I also noticed some redness and swelling at the injection site. Could this be a normal reaction or should I be concerned? Has anyone else had similar symptoms after getting their booster shot?"""
9108,Monkeypox is now in . I do have wonder what all these vaccines are doing to our bodies when taken relatively close together 6mthly flu covid RSV Shingles Smallpox. I can no longer have the flu vaccine as I had severe reaction. Are we overloading our bodies with vaccines?
9109,It was not PN it was a zona: Hi I Am 33F I did get chickenpox as a child and I did already had a zona located on my hips before It seem like the virus is really liking me maybe also I miss translate shingles I Am French native I also forgot to mentionned that it occurred as I was almost burned out from work basically my body decided to stop it all before my brain
9113,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I had a very mild case in my back. It was a bad couple weeks of intense debilitating pain. If you get it I recommend ice packs constant ice was the only thing that helped.
9114,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I had a massive stroke. I Am disabled for life.
9116,Urgent care has no idea thinks its shingles.: No pain or soreness. Just felt like i had a burn when touching it. It did not bother me. Pretty much scabbed over now. No idea how i would get herpes on the back of my leg. The blisters got big looked like warts before they popped. The provider did clean the area with a bacteria cleaner and then popped a few blisters. When i cam home i cleaned it with rubbing alcohol to kill everything. That night the redness already started to go down.
9117,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: The worst reaction to the vaccine is nothing compared to the stories of getting shingles. I got mine.
9118,RSV Vaccine: Yes its your body producing an immune response to the vaccine you will struggle to keep your numbers down. Mine went crazy and I was eating the same things that had been fine the day before. My diabetes team were not concerned at all and they should go back to normal tomorrow.
9123,So I started having the sensitive skin symptoms in my leg before the rash appeared. Once it appeared I thought it could be from some sort of insect bites. Than the pain spread to left lower hip and back. When they told me shingles that was the last thing I expected. Anyone else got shingles super young? Also I had the vaccine when I was younger and never had chickenpox before. What is the best way to manage it?
9131,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: It was not THAT bad. I did it on a Friday afternoon so I had the next day to ride the couch and I just rested. But I was not miserable.
9132,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: 25 of the people who get the shingles series will have a robust immune response fever body aches headache tiredness and a very sore arm. This is because there is an adjuvant in it that stimulates the immune system. As we age the immune system does not work as well as when we were kids so the vaccine needs something to help trigger the immune system.
9133,2. RSV mediumeasy Called doc's office to inquire. They did not have the vaccine in right away but called a few weeks later to let me know we could book it. Baby's big sibling had a confirmed case with super high fever 3 weeks after baby got the shot so well worth it
9136,Shingles Vaccine: I got shingrex boosted my TDAP flu covid anything they would give me about a month before I started kesimpta. Felt REALLY crappy for a couple days then it was fine. I was 29 and it was a huuuuge battle to get approved for shingrex so if you are too young for shingles shots you will need backup from a doctor.
9139,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I have recurring bouts of shingles. it is near my tail bone. I have the R X on hand. I cannot get the vaccine I tried.
9140,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yeah 2nd dose hit me too
9141,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Got shingles 2 years ago. Back of my skull and neck are still scarred with no feeling because of nerve damage. Would not wish that on ANYONE Thanks parents
9144,One knocked me on my butt but I do not recall which. I also had the flu shot the same day so I had two useless arms for a couple of days. Still 100 better than getting shingles.
9146,Shingles vaccine experience: I had no reaction to either shot. Guess I got lucky.
9147,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: I was 8. There were three doctors in our doctor's practice and he had the other two come in to examine me and confirm because he could not believe it. You can bet I got Shin gri x as soon as it was available. Both shots hit me like a ton of bricks the following day but that was nothing compared to shingles. A friend of ours got shingles inside his mouth when he was in his 60 s and lost his sense of taste for two years.
9150,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Unrelated to the age but I got shingles when I was in middle school. They lasted for fucking ever and they drove me insane Apparently they hurt more as you get older so mine was more of a constant itching sensation that burned when I did itch them but it was not fun. The moral of the story is that you can get shingles whenever but they are much worse as you age.
9151,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles during finals week during undergrad. Just putting on a shirt made me cry they hurt so bad. Thankfully I had a mild case otherwise that resolved within a week
9153,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Thank you. To be completely honest she is not the same cognitively and probably never will be. It is been something that keeps me awake at night so if you see me posting here at like 4 am on a random day that is why. Side effects of chemotherapy can be long lasting.
9155,Shingles Is NO Joke: I had it when I was 23 I am now 35. Sorry you are going through that it is awful. I am so afraid of getting it again. 2 years ago I got poison ivy interestingly the early symptoms of shingle feels a lot like the early symptoms of poison ivy for me. Mild panic LOL
9156,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I did not but I have lingering nerve pain from the actual virus
9157,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Both kicked my ass but it was only two days and I did not miss work. Considering what shingles did to people I know the relatively minor discomfort was worth it.
9158,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: My kiddo got shingles when she was 22. Worst pain she is ever experienced.
9159,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: My dad grew up poor and did not get vaccines as kid. Got measles at 40bad. Got shingles. Got shingles vaccine. Managed to get shingles againI think because virus was too new in his body to be totally conquered. Its no joke for sure
9160,Shingles vaccine experience: For me the worst was actually the meds going into my arm. Felt like liquid fire. After that it was not really worse than a flu shot.
9161,I got both yesterday. Other than a slightly sore arm I feel relatively ok. I was also going to get the Shingles vaccine but the pharmacist recommended I wait two weeks before getting it.
9165,Second Shingles Shot: I got shingles. It sucked. Felt like my ribs were breaking. I plan to get it.
9167,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I also had shingles at 13 RamsayHunt Syndrome technicallywith shingles in my ear that attacked the auditory nerves in my face and half my face was paralyzed. Yeah 7th grade with glasses braces and half a smile was not my cutest year lol. I got shingles again at 32 in 2020 and I Am always worried that it will flare up if I get too stressedrun down. Why the hell cannot I get the vaccine?
9168,Do you know anyone that has received both dose of the Shin gri x vaccine and later had shingles? Thank you.
9169,Would baby be more protected if I get the RSV vaccine 32 weeks pregnant or if she gets the monoclonal antibody injection during the next RSV season?: Tagging on to this to add I received the RSV vaccine while pregnant since my baby was due in November. Husband recently caught RSV and passed it on to me. I did not get that sick and the baby never showed any signs of catching it
9173,New Shingrix data demonstrate 100 vaccine efficacy in the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over in China: She said it might help and I checked with my gynaecologist and he said that was smart thinking. I think it s not really research based but gut feeling. As I had almost monthly outbreaks I decided to spend a couple of hundred euros on the vac c in twice to be administered After the second shot I have not yet had an outbreak But that was six weeks ago so fingers crossed.
9175,Latest news on 4 viruses on the rise across the YOU.S.: No one I know has had any kind of bad reaction besides a slightly sore arm at the injection site for a day. All vaccine and multiboosted. What is the basis for your comment? Some YouTuber?
9179,Has anyone else gotten the Shingrix vaccination and then had PVCs start for the very first time in their life shortly after the vaccination? 5 days after my shot I got my first noticeable PVCs
9181,Do not follow the rules and do not hide from the environment. I was asymptomatic for COVID 6 times. The last time I was sick was because I agreed to a shingles vaccination. Was sick for 3 days and did not take the second shot. Before that last time I was sick was in 2010. Bacteria
9184,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I did not really have a reaction to either just a sore arm so no different than a flu shot for me.
9194,Vaccinations?: Yes get the vaccines. I think hepatitis might be an actual requirement but do not sleep on the shingles one. I am one of the people here who posted my shingles horror story from last summer. I was hospitalized for a week in isolation and missed an entire week of pool and swimming weather and had to arrange childcare for my kids for the entire time I was in the hospital. Also from an especially AS perspective when you are hospitalized for shingles you have to have IVs every few hours of antiviral medicine to fight off the zoster virus. It takes a really long time for them to drip the IV into you. Like as long as 90 minutes for one sometimes. And you need to do this multiple times a day like 35x per day. If you combine this with sleep time this means that you are really losing a lot of time to be mobile each day and keep your joints moving. It adds a lot of sedentary time per day above and beyond your usual day. And as we all know sitting in one position for a long time and not moving your arms or the rest of your body makes AS super angry Get your shingles vaccine everyone
9195,Got my Shingles vaccine: Got both shots I can see the aliens living among us.
9199,Did Not vote for him but since he won: I Am 36 just had shingles all over the left side of my face and in my left eye it should be much younger.
9201,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My wife is 39 she was a military brat got the chicken pox vaccine as a kid was not available to me still got chicken pox twice as a kid and got shingles last year. So ymmv. My kids got vaccinated as babies and have not had the pox.
9203,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yup. Hot the pox when I was 6 I think. My mom said it was intentional. Got shingles a few years ago now I have a permanent itchy spot on my hack where I cannot reach.
9204,Shingles vaccine question: I Have never had a vaccination affect me for more than 48 hours including the shingles one which was far and away the worst and kicked my ass.
9206,Hi guys I got diagnosed with shingles behind my ear yesterday. Last week Wednesday I woke up with tinnitus I thought it was maybe caused by listening to music too loudly though my earphones. A couple of days later I felt a bump behind my ear however it was Saturday by then and I knew I would not be able to get a doctor's appointment until Monday. Yesterday I went in to the doctor and she told me I had shingles and that I luckily caught it and came in early enough. I am a bit skeptical mostly due to my own trust issues with doctors being wrong in the past but I figured it is better to be safe than sorry. The reason I am skeptical is because there is only one 'blister' behind my ear and I do not have to enormous amount of pain that people usually get from shingles. Nevertheless I got the medication and I am now taking it. I am taking 500mg of Zelivire 2 tablets 3 times a day 1500mg and 40gm of panafcort cortisone. I took it for the first time last night and experienced no side effects. I did not even get insomnia like my doctor warned me I would. This morning I took the 40mg of cortisone and then waited an hour before taking the Zelivire. I have been struggling with heart palpitations since. My heart feels heavy and sometimes starts beating really fast when I sit up or stand up. Is this normal? I Do Not Know why it would happen today but not last night.
9210,MY FAMILY ALONE... CLOTS 19yr old male POTS 16 yr old female Low Testosterone 45 yr Shingles 50 male ALL were in GREAT HEALTH prior 2 Covid Vaccine NONE of them were AT RISK of deathdisability due2 COVID19 This is CRIMINAL StopTheShots American political
9212,"51/M Should I get the flu vaccine on the same day I get my (second) shingles shot?: The required info. out of the way first: * 51M, 5' 9"", 196lbs., caucasoid * non-smoker, 1 drink maybe every 3 or 4 months, non-recreational drug user (I don't take drugs) * fully (covid) vaccinated (2 shots) * meds: none * supplements (daily): 2000mgs omega-3 fish oil, 40mgs UC-II collagen, Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc (1000 mgs/500mgs/15mgs), 20g collagen peptides, 750mgs Creatine HCL, 10g psyllium husks * exercise: 5 days of intense cardio.- 1 hour/day; 7 days- 35-45 min walks (occasional days 1-2 hours) *Hopefully that covers all required info.* When I got my first shingles shot, I also got a tetanus shot (10 years had lapsed between shots). I had a strong reaction; strong full body aches, lethargy, headache and slight raised temperature (not full-blown fever) for about 3 days. I don't know if it was the shingles shot, the tetanus shot or the combination of both at the same time. I don't remember having the reaction last time I got the tetanus booster. *So given that, my question is:* Should I wait a couple of weeks after getting my second shingles shot to get the flu vaccine, or would it be prudent to get both the shingles shot and flu vaccine at the same time? Thanks in advance for the advice. EDIT: So I'm aware that it's safe to get both shots at the same time. Let me rephrase my question: **Given my previous reaction to the (multiple) shots, will I suffer the same strong reactions I previously encountered (above) if I get both shots concurrently?**"
9216,Ha. First develop vaccine to cure covid but gives you shingles. Them develop vaccine to cure shingles. Tell me it is safe and effective one more time mutha fers.
9218,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Shingles gave me deep electricalzap migraine headaches that made me flinch all out of control from the random precision brain attacks. It started as a rash on my ear and scalp like poison ivy but the painful stabs underneath became a nightmare every 10 seconds for about a month. I highly recommend the vaccine
9219,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I Am usually on top of all those but the Covid jabs were a bitch and friends who felt the same said the Shingles one was worse. I know I got to bite that bullet sometime soon though.
9226,Shingles Vaccine: You do not want shingles Please get it. I got shingles and granted it was before my MS diagnosis but so terrible. I cannot even imagine how bad it would be with MS
9228,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I think I took around 1000 or 2000 mg of lysine daily I cannot remember exactly because it was almost 4 years ago. Yeah I stayed away from sesame and nutsseeds for a long time. I did have nonburning pain. My pain was more like stabbing pain I even had tightness in my chest and rib area that affected my stomach as well. Felt like I had a tight rubber band around my stomach.
9229,Shingles vaccine: Shots 1 and 2 ruined both weekends for me but that was well worth it given the alternative
9230,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Chills and aches about 24 hours ..
9234,Shingles vaccine experience: Both shots there was nothing but the usual soreness where the needle went in. Its no different than a bunch of people catching a cold. Some get nothing but the sniffles others are down for the count.
9239,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My preemies got their first shot at 7 weeks old 36 weeks adjusted 24 hours before we left the NICU. No issues.
9240,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: That tingle on just one half of the torso. The left or the right. Its the nervous system so its cookie cutter precision. Itches go to itch it hey this is what a blow torch suddenly feels like if you point it at your skin I had chicken pox same virus when I was 2 and it nearly killed me. If Id have gotten it as an adult it surely would have. Its always worse getting it as an adult.
9243,I started Mounjaro a few months ago and am currently up to 7.5 dosage. It immediately dropped my A1C from 9 to 6 so it has been a bit of a miracle there for me. I have lost about 3 lbs total but I have only got about 20 overall I would like to lose. A few weeks ago I developed Shingles. My dr mentioned that she has heard this more and more with those using Mounjaro. I did a search of posts on this forum and there were a few talking about it but they were all older and archived so I wanted to check in on this with the current community. Some of those posts suggested the weight loss was causing stress on the body which caused the shingles but I have not really lost weight. Has anyone else gotten Shingles after starting Mounjaro? And to those of you who have not had it yet I would highly recommend getting the Shingles vaccine I wish I had but I was not aware there was one as you do not want this. It is very painful.
9246,My mom got these blisters after putting on antiperspirant: She was also vaccinated for shingles
9249,Shingles vaccine: Shingles is fucking awful. Got it at 48. Weeks of pain.
9250,Why are my family hating on me? Am I just clueless?: God from what you have said its like they think RSV was only touted as 'omg so dangerous after Covid. My daughter was born in '16 4 months early and her first winter we were so thankful that she qualified for the RSV vaccine... Because we knew waaaaay back in the great 'before' times that RSV and tiny babies should not mix. I honestly hate people that brainlessly mutter Its just a bad cold for any potentially serious illness. Survivour bias is stupid and strong.
9251,Shingles vaccine: I have the gene as well. I Have never heard that before about the live virus reactions. That Is interesting because I Have never had problems with MMR or Chickenpox but I react badly to tetanus shots and my Covid booster. Have you had any live vaccinations?
9254,Shingles vaccine experience: I felt bad after the second shot but not the first. Still glad I did itpeople I know who have had shingles say its awful.
9255,Baby RSV Shot: Mine got it at 3 weeks and had no issues.
9257,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: Massive fatigue and aches starting 2 days before then rash with pain on one side of the waist that eventually became blisters
9259,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: I checked and the CVS site says they recommend two doses. I have no idea if that is across the board. I am not looking forward to this one
9260,Shingles vaccine experience: I must be some kind of weirdo because I have had both shots of the shingles vaccine and had no adverse reactions either time.
9261,Since my last reaction to SAD BE went epic ally bad with me ending up in A E I am scared off the stuff permanently. So I am going to go back to my previous solution which was a shot of Zo st a vaccine which is a vaccine for shingle. This work better than SAD BE for me as I went 9 months without an outbreak. The only reason it stopped work for me was because I had to have a course of antibiotics. That messed things up and probably brought my tite r level down enough for the cross reactivity to become null and void. So I am talking with a private clinic to get another boost and bring them back up. If you do not know what I am talking about you can read up here and here My question though in regards to SAD BE. My last dose was only 31 days ago so its yet to exert its full power 43 days was the timeline in the clinical trials. So does that mean if I have a shot of Zo st a vaccine next week there will be less HSV in my system for the vaccine to cross react with. Should l wait for SAD BE to wear off before getting the shot for a better response to it Thank you for any insight and I hope everyone is well.
9266,Shingles and methotrexate: I have not had shingles but my sister had them on her 16th birthday and it seemed brutal. I do have RA though and I started on 15 mg MTX last May. My inflammation was down but my pain did not change so my doctor increased it to 20 mg in July. Both times I felt like I would been hit by a bus the day after my dose for like a month and then slowly I would feel a little less shitty each week. I feel you on the lymph nodes swelling. Mine fluctuate in size quite a bit on mtx. It freaked me tf out but my rheum said that some swelling is okay as long as it goes down eventually. If it is swollen and stays that way or is tender and hard my rheum wants me to call. And though I have not gotten shingles I did get hand foot and mouth in late August. I went to visit my fiance's family and was holding his niece when her mother started telling me about how HFM was tearing through her new daycare. I handed that sweet child back to her mom so fast and went to wash my hands and change clothes immediately. In their defense we live in different parts of the country so they are not aware I am immunocompromised which probably made my reaction seem super weird. So about a week later I started developing blisters in my mouth and stopped my meds. These blisters spread everywhere over 3 weeks before beginning to heal. Around week two my mother wants to bring me a care package. Long story short she had COVID and a week later so did I. Never in my life had I been so sick. It was terrible so I can certainly empathize with you. Hang in there and I am sorry you are dealing. With this
9268,Vaccine question: i would listen to your GI and get the HE P B vaccine. my twin who has crohn s had to get the vaccine again even though she is had it before because she did not have enough antibodies developed from the vaccine while on in fli xima b. also in regards to the shingles vaccine it is up to you since you are not on immunosuppressant s i do not think it is necessary but it is definitely something to think about in case your illness progresses to needing it. i got the shingles vaccine because I am on in fli xima b. the guidelines changed to include anyone in a immuno suppress iv eim mun compromised state aged 19 and older but that is based in US.
9269,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I Am dyingand apparently so is she
9270,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I 100 admit to being a future scrunchy mom. I plan on natural childbirth. I plan on breastfeeding. I plan on trying to give my kids organic homemade baby food cloth diapers and alternative vaccine schedules. However chicken pox is something I would never screw with primarily because of shingles. I was a member of the first generation to have the chicken pox vaccine available to me but insurance would not cover it. My parents chose to get it for me anyways. I remember asking them so assuming you got me the chicken pox vaccine because you did not want to deal with 4 year old me having chicken pox? My dad said Well it was a benefit we did not think about we were thinking about shingles and discussed why the herpes zoster virus is such a pain in the behind to treat. The virus weaves itself into your nervous system that is why so many people get shingles. I then promptly freaked out because I apparently had a reaction to the live vaccine and had poxes for a few days afterwards and I was worried about developing shingles. I will still need the shingles vaccine eventually and apparently it is not a fun one and may have to pay out of pocket for it kind of want to get it at 40 not 50 but shingles is something I would not want to mess with. I also thought to myself while reading this post holy crap I need to keep my babies in bubbles until they are 18 months so that they do not catch chicken pox but then I remembered heard immunity and how it is rare to see someone with chicken pox these days thanks to heard immunity. So I am also curious about just where this MIL got that chicken pox.
9273,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: May actually be related. My dad was part of a study to see the safety of getting the first Shingles shot and the flu shot at the same time. Obviously this is anecdotal, but they observed that most people who did not have much reaction to the COVID shot (not counting the sore arm) didn't have much reaction to either Shingles shot. A lot of comments on here are reinforcing this theory. Which means it will probably knock me on my ass, but I will still be beating down the door for Shingrex right when I turn 50!"
9277,Day 21 if shingles still taking the pain meds and nerve blockers. Rash is looking better bit still getting nerve pain. I have nearly lost the month of July with shingles. Make sure you get vaccinated if you can.
9283,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Got my shots at 50 hopefully it works. My marriage could not handle me with the shingles lol
9285,41 and got Shingles: My wife did. She caught it within an hour of the breakout and was on medicine for them within the next hour so fortunately it was not sever.
9286,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My sibling and I born 1992 and 1994 were both vaccinated as young children when the vaccine came out AND we both managed to catch chicken pox a few years after being vaccinated I guess the vaccine they had back then was not 100 effective
9287,Shingles vaccine: second dose: My only symptom was an extremely sore arm which lasted for days
9288,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus ....mmmmm I do not know about all that
9290,So basically I am in a predicament where I might not have insurance due to my controlling parents. For context my parents are super conservative Protestant Christians and tend to be controlling. My current insurance is abouut to end this month and I am supposed to get a new insurance in january but my parents refused to give me my current insurance cardinformation so i had to directly call them for my insurance information with this info i was able to get my first dose of the hpv vaccine and seek mental help for my anxiety something that my parents were aganist now that my current insurance is going to expire I will have to go through the process of trying to get my information for my new insurance but this time i do not think it will work because my new insurance is provided by my moms hospital compared to my current insurance where it was medicad what makes this situation worse is that I have a upcoming appointment in jan to get my 2nd dose of my hpv vaccine and a upcoming appointment in december to get medication for my anxiety  and my current insurance will end this monthsomething i just recently figured out. I Am just so frustrated. Even into adulthood I am 18 I still feel controlled and limited due to my parents controlling actions. I do not know what to do if I cannot get access to my new insurance I do not know if I will be able to get my 2nd dose of my HPV shot I do not know if my impacted wisdom teeth will get worse and ruin my other teeth without any treatment.
9291,Good way to cover up shingles caused by vaccine
9293,Hello I am a 21year old female medical student but am terrible at diagnosing myself so here we go. My medical history is unremarkable apart from osteoporosis and my meds are Wellbutrin and a tiny dose of quetiapine to sleep. Since 7 months I have been having episodic 34x a day paresthesia and numbness on my left shoulder blade. I did not have any other symptoms but it was really bothering me so I saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with recovered shingles zoster sine herpete so shingles without the rash which made sense to me. Today I have had an episode of severe tingles in my left leg not going away even after walking or just waiting. I have also been experiencing double vision right when I wake up nearly every day. could this be MS? I am getting an MRI of my neck would MS show in the primary stages? Thank you
9294,But I Am also immunocompromised and got my first autoimmune disease at 14 so I Am not an example of an average healthy young person who got shingles but that DID happen to my healthy sister in law She also had pox and not the shot.
9296,If it is hot serious reaction or infection. Not normal monitor closely. If gets bigger go to doc I had shingles now immune for life Managed pain w heat pad Same as chicken pox as a child Do not need experiment vaccine BY THE WAY was fully vaccine at age 4 still got mumps chickpox measles
9297,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I am getting a nerve block. Has anyone tried that
9298,shingles???: I got shingles when I started my infliximab treatment. That was an awful experience
9299,Shingles vaccine: Do it. I Am a teacher who missed the first 10 weeks of the school year this year because of shingles on my face and my eye. it is no joke. I had a mild case 20 years ago and I sort of thought I could never get it again. Guess what 5 or something like that do in fact get it again. I tell you get the vaccine Everyone in my circle was horrified by my face and so many people I knew went out and got the vaccine after that
9300,Shingles for the 2nd time forehead: Hope you get better soon I am on Day 18 sores dried up but very sore and sensitive. No headaches but slight nerve pain here and there. Then it goes away. The biggest thing is fatigue. I am watching my body fight so hard to get well. This is not for sissy's Very difficult.
9305,Shingles vaccine?: I have not had the vaccine but after getting omicron covid at 27 I got shingles and it was terrible. I plan to get the vaccine when my insurance will allow it.
9306,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles in elementary school. Never had chicken pox. Luckily I guess as a kid the pain component of shingles is not as severe as it is for adults. But I did have sores on my head and in my eye so I am really not looking forward to having any flare ups. Does the vaccine provide protection for people who already had shingles?
9312,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It was a frikkin nightmare was not it? Oh it was so awful
9319,"I got my second vaccine yesterday: I didn't know I needed a second one. I have all the side effects of the vaccine. Fever, shaking, headache, nausea. My husband declared that he is never getting the shingles vaccine. I think it's worth it, having heard so many horror stories. I'm sorry for everyone who has shingles."
9320,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Husband just got his vaccine now I want to know which one lol Thanks for the info
9322,Genuinely curious as I Have been long hauling for several years now but back in February I go to very sick developed a fever of 103 and ever since I Have been predominantly bedbound with a constant low grade fever between 99.5101. My doctor sent me to an infectious disease doctor and I asked to be tested for EBV and Shingles. I had both around a decade ago and they really messed me up back then He told me there would be no point in testing me because Id already had it and would have antibodies anyway or something like that. I Am not being taken seriously and have been told to wait it out but its getting close to a year and I have not made any improvements. My constant crushing head pressure fever and migraines are driving me insane. I have so many ice packs to try to cool my head several times a day and the only thing that helps with the head pressure and fever is high dose ibuprofen. I Am worried I Am running into kidney damage territory at this point. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
9326,I got blindsided by the 2d dose of shingles vaccine. First was meh.
9328,Shingles vaccine: I did not have any issues but I did get shingles later.
9333,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: You probably will. I legit got the shingles two years ago and was better after a few days on the meds. Hydrate and get some solid sleep tonight. Dream of the chickenpox parties of your youth.
9336,Has anyone else gotten a covid booster AND shingles at the same appointment?: I have had covid and influenza same appt. Not exactly the same. Wrecked for 2 days. Fine after. But realistically I am usually fine after flu vaccine and wrecked after covid. Trust your Dr and pharmacist they read the research and what the regulators work out is safe.
9337,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Like I said I already had shingles. Extremely painful.
9342,Second Shingles Shot: Yeah I definitely do not feel very hungry today. Hopefully that is the extent of it.
9348,At the beginning of this year someone gave my Mom a flu shot pneumonia and RSV shot unbeknownst to me. She has had Covid Pneumonia twice and shingles this year . She is 94. I gave in to letting her get a tetanus shot at the hospital and did not know it was the DPT shot.
9349,Shingles vaccine: Had the 1st and was logy for a day or so. Less of a reaction for the 2nd dose. Have heard the horror stories from friends who got shingles. Worth all the discomfort.
9351,"Vaccination causing me to be extra sensitive to allergies?: I recently had to get the varicella vaccination for school. And had no reaction to it, but I realized I kept ""getting sick"" every day and finally realized I was allergic to my soap fragrance. But I've always been allergic to strong fragrances before and generally only floral scents. And it seemed odd for me to suddenly become more allergic. But I chucked all the soap and replaced it with scentless and I thought everything was fine. But I then realized without the constant sneezing from the soap as a factor, that everything I eat makes me feel sick as well and also gives me small hives after eating (I thought the soap was giving me hives). But my diet hasn't changed at all. I have autoimmune problems, so I wonder if that's a factor? I had an allergic reaction to the hep b vaccine 2 years ago and it caused my eczema to flare up and my thyroid organ to completely die (I have graves autoimmune thyroid disease since I was 17) and I recall back then I got hives to everything I ate as well. Is there any research on vaccines and autoimmune diseases? And if its the cause of this. Will it eventually go away because I'm pretty afraid of eating atm. Is there anything recommended to eat if everything makes me sick? Sick as in hives, sneezing, and nauseated/bloated/my intestines feel bothered. For info my diet is usually: tofu, beans, rice, quinoa, berries, cereal, some veggies like bok choy and lettuce, potatoes, bread, noodles, chips and salsa, etc. I'm vegetarianish and have been for 5 years."
9352,5mg Reaction: I Have had injection site reactions for a year now. They Are annoying but as long as they are localized usually not a big deal.
9353,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: Our November '23 baby got the RSV vaccine early on and while they were cared for at home my April '21 baby lol ok preschooler still went to school. He brought home all sorts of germs despite us washing hands and changing clothes . However we never had anything more than runny noses and mild fevers that could also be due to teething. Meanwhile when my firstborn was that age and the vaccine was not available we got bulldozed by hand foot and mouth HFM RSV COVID daycare colds etc back to back for months and months. So of course I cannot see what would happen if we had not had the vaccine in an alternate timeline but we have certainly not been knocked out and have had a way milder time.
9359,Dealing w people's remarks on unhealthy food: I LOVE THAT Like as much fun as being in absolute agony for days would be if I eat the wrong food I will also get massive spasms in my calves and feet...so it is like I am good I do not need that in my life...much rather the Russian roulette that this illness plays on the daily and just having to roll with the punches each day brings me even though I am following what it asks for every day. Unfortunately there is no healthy allencompassing diet for everyone so it is like this is working for me yes I know to watch my carbs so I do not get diabetes but beyond that my doctors are good so why cannot everyone else be? I have had shingles twice now and even that you can see how horrified people get once they are around you and see how unbelievably painful it is the commercials do not do it justice the virus is literally frying your nerve endings so 247 unrelenting pain like it feels like some poured boiling oil on you and you cannot relieve it whatsoever. It is not necessarily funny but it was interesting to see how many people are now planning to get the Shingrix vaccine after seeing my experience with shingles now. But again it is only because I showed them the entire process otherwise I would be like 247 1010 pain for up to 5 weeks I still have neuralgia in a bad patch I had the who dermatome this time and my back and side were really bad and my last flare was in May. It just shows you how little people will believe those things to the extent they are unless they can visibly see it I also get internal shingles which is what I think led to the extreme progression of my dysmotility and so I experience a lot of pain but it seems that people only believe it if it makes sense to them sorry diseases are not here for you to make sense of especially if you have no medical education.
9360,Shingles Is NO Joke: Oh I totally feel for you I thought you had to be 55 to get the vaccine. I just got them this last summer. Worst thing ever My daughter has had them 4 times.

9367,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I had shingles on my face two years ago but not in my eye or ear. Then last winter I got shingles again this time in my ear and nose and I have nerve damage that is affecting my eye and causing headaches. I asked at the pharmacy about the vaccine and was told insurance would not cover it because I am under 50. I called my insurance to verify and they said the vaccine was covered with no age restriction. I went back to the pharmacy and told them it would go through insurance. They said it was store policy not to give it under age 50. I called another pharmacy and they said it was state law not to give it under age 50. I called my PCP and asked her to prescribe it. Then I went back to my usual pharmacy and told them I had a prescription and got the vaccine. I just got the second dose two weeks ago.
9371,I went through the same thing. Shingles vaccine was rough.

9394,"Hey everyone, seeking some advice here. I recently developed Bell's Palsy, and I can't pinpoint the exact cause. However, about a week before the symptoms appeared, I received my second dose of the HPV vaccine. I'm concerned that my body may have had a negative reaction to the vaccine, leading to Bell's Palsy. Will the vaccine still be effective for me in providing protection against the virus despite this reaction? Additionally, does anyone know if Bell's Palsy can impact the immune system's strength in any way? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help! ---"
9398,JNML lied about vaccine: I get the flu  Covid vaccines every year. Last year I got the RSV vaccine  a TDAP booster. Why? One of my great nieces is an immune comprised toddler. I also work at a retirement home. There the flu shot is mandatory but a friend had RSV last year  I did not want to take chances with the residents nor older family members. Personally I think your MIL is a selfish CU Next Thursday but she is an adult and can make her own choices. However that choice should not mean you have to risk your life or your baby's life. And just a side note the RSV shot hurt like the dickens for days. Still going to get it again next year.

9411,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I was the chicken pox kid. I had it really bad still have several large scars from it but I remember having friends come over and visit several times while I was sick. We never had a party because I had a fever and was clearly sick. My parents would let friends and their parents come over and it was often very nice. I was gifted house plants cards all sorts of get well gifts which I was thrilled about because I was 3 or 4 at the time. I remember every time this happened my friend and I were given a sucker to share. Like oh we have a tootsie pop but only one so you will both have to lick it Honestly each visit was only 1530 minutes because I wassick. Just long enough to breathe on my friends and share some candy.

9415,F27 in Toronto Non smoker No health conditions Recently stopped taking accutane 20mgday for 1 month cold turkey I take Dayvigo periodically. I noticed 5 days ago these patches started appearing on my torso back armpits chest arms and thighs. They are itchy but I have no other symptoms. I initially thought they were patches of eczema which I have never had before until they started getting worse and worse. Some things to note I recently stopped taking accutane cold turkey because of a few different circumstances. The last time I took it was 2 weeks ago. While my place was being remodeled I stayed at an airbnb for 2 nights around when I started noticing these spots. It was a slightly sketchy place but I had checked for bedbugs and saw no signs of them and do not see any signs of them now that I Am back home either. My roommates who stayed in the same room as me do not have these anywhere on their body. There has also been a massive heatwave and I am very sensitive to the sun. Please can someone advise what these are and might have be caused by? I have had chickenpox as a kid and am vaccinated against measles etc. Heat rash? Bed bug bites? Shingles? Help

9417,That shingles shot took me down for 3 days. Glad I got it though I know a few people who have had shingles its a horrible infection.
9418,Shingles at 37: I had shingles in September 2020. It hit me in the facial nerve on my left side paralyzing that side of my face and giving me horrible vertigo. I have arthritis and am on a bio logic medication along with the diabetes. At my first ER visit they misdiagnosed me with an inner ear problem so I took my Hum ira. It knocked my immune system down and I got really sick. I ended up with viral sepsis disseminated shingles and DKA. I was in hospital for 21 days during the height of C covid prior to vaccine vaccines. I ve never been that sick before and I hope I never am again. Shingles is nothing to mess with. So much more than just an annoying rash. I m left with facial disfigurement and nerve issues in my ear and face. I ll probably be on Gaba pent in for the rest of my life for the nerve problems. I have post her pet ic itch. Anyone over 50 needs to get a shingles vaccine. I had just turned 50 when I got shingles. I was waiting for my rheum a to logi st to give me the referral for the pharmacy.
9419,Friend had 4 or 5 shots. Recently had hemorrhaging in one eye. Now she has gotten the shingles shot telling me I need it now she wants to get the pneumonia shot. I Have tried telling her the side effects of Covid shots and asked why she is so shot happy. I give up
9420,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: you might want to check out r shingles because a lot of us have had it. I got it at 53 and had been waiting to get the vaccine only because of another health issue that made me not want to risk side effects just yet adding misery on top of misery. I had every intention of getting vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated. Luckily for me I had a mild case but the nerve pain still comes and goes 6 months after the fact.
9422,Shingles and other Vaccines: Shingles was the worst for mesecond one kicked my butt
9423,Spacing out Shingles Vaccine: I got a C covid booster flu shot and took my injection all in the same couple of hours and I had no adverse effects. If you suffer side effects push it back a couple days.
9426,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: This here. It makes me feel old but I remember when the chicken pox vaccine came out. My mom could not remember if Id had chicken pox or not when the pediatrician asked if I needed the vaccine. I was 7 and insisted I had as I remembered connecting the dots. She could not recall so I got an unexpected vaccine at that appointment. And I never forgave her. s
9429,Dude Do not get the shingles shot especially the first one with anything else It was like death worse than when I actually had Covid. For whatever reason the first in the series for shingles is a DOOZY. Plan on being out of commission about a day and a half
9430,I am a 60 year old female 5ft and 210 lbs that has had severe RA since I was 35. I have Raynaud's and Sjorgen's. I also had a spinal fusion when I was 22. I had a full spinal fusion revision five years ago. I got the WORST case of shingles when having the revision surgery. It was a 12 hour surgery and my immune system crashed. When I got out of the hospital and everything was cleared up I attempted to get vaccinated. I got the first shot not realizing I had a case of shingles on my back. They would not let me get the second shot. I have had shingles 4 times since the revision surgery. I now take Valacyclovir every day. My question is this I am going to have to have another revision surgery after a horrible fall. I have not had shingles for 2 years. Should I try to get vaccinated again? Or will the daily 500 mg of valacyclovir be enough?
9432,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Unfortunately I had a really tough time of it. Its the first vaccine that I have ever felt that literally I was going to die. I wondered if it was so bad for me because I suffer from neuralgia I Am too chicken to do the 2nd one. Most people I Have talked said they had no problem with it. I Am sure you will be fine..
9435,My big flex is getting the shingles vaccine despite not being over 50. Because I have an autoimmune disease. Dammit.
9437,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I cannot even imagine how I would react if my MIL did that. As someone who has had shingles 2x I Am in my late 30s I hate when people make chicken pox out to be this big nothing. I have permanent pain in one arm when touched due to shingles. The MIL getting shingles was the best Karma.
9439,Anyone feel like they got hit by a bus after getting Shingrix Vaccine?: My understanding is that it is common to feel terrible after Shin gri x regardless of any other issues. it is a nasty one I felt awful too so glad that is over with. Hang in there
9443,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Oh my goodness I am so sorry that sounds absolutely miserable. So far my stress manifests in migraines which is its own special hell. If I get shingles on top of that yikes. But several here have said that the stress activatedaggravated their shingles. I hope yours has decreased these days and you have no more flareups.
9446,"Pfizer Vaccine Side Effects: Hi, my girlfriend has been experiencing relatively serious symptoms a week after taking the first pfizer vaccine shot. I'm wondering if anyone has encountered the following: \- Sharp pain around the on trigeminal nerve (around the temple, underneath the eye, and on the jawline). The pain is similar to that of shingles. \- Shooting pain throughout the hand. \- Joints pain in the kneecaps and legs (similar to growing pains). If anyone has had similar symptoms, I would really appreciate hearing about your experience. I'm wondering if we need to be seeing a doctor or neurologist for this. Thanks in advance!"
9447,Second Shingles Shot: That sounds horrible. One of my friends got it a week after giving birth. It was horrendous. She was only 28.
9448,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I had shingles back in 2012 after a lot of business related stress. It was not a bad case but it was still terrible.
9450,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Well shit if someone was flexing they got vaccine and fainted it would make me not take vaccines
9451,TDaP While Pregnant: lol at studies. You know the studies are biased right? Like they will admit a vaccine does not work but they still recommend it. Google fully vaccinated schools with pertussis outbreaks. My 17 year old was also injured by that vaccine at age 5.
9454,38F immunocompromised. My dad had just passed away on August 10th after a month long fight in the hospital. The day after he passed I developed a pounding headache and nothing touched it. I tried everything. It continued day and night for 6 days straight. This was accompanied by insomnia and body aches. I chalked it up to stress and grief at first but then I started getting concerned and I was about to go see a doctor because of the severity and relentlessness of my symptoms when I woke up one morning with 3 rashes with clusters of blisters located on my inner arm and chest. I went right to urgent care and sure enoughshingles. I took the usual Valtrex 1000mg 3x daily. Honestly the pain from the rashes paled and comparison to the headaches. After a few days the headaches subsided and by the end of the 7 days on valtrex the rashes dried up. I honestly consider my case to be very mild and interestingly enough my mom said that when I had chicken pox as a kid it was also very mild and I only had a few spots. I really thought that was interesting how they both presented very similarly. Much love to anyone working through shingles right now
9457,Vaccines: I got shingles and pneumonia in addition to all the regular ones. RSV I have not.
9459,Shingles vaccine: Got my first a couple weks ago. I had zero reaction besides a sore deltoid.
9461,Shingles vaccine: I had a pacemaker put in and something happened with my heart and it shot a searing stabbing throbbing pain up my heart into my neck and face and into my brain anytime I moved more than a couple inches which lasted for a month. I could not lie down either. I wished for death and I thought I was going to die. I nor the doctors knew what it was maybe pericarditis. I had that in August 4 years ago at 47 and got shingles in December of that same year. Shingles was a walk in the park compared to that. Was not a fun second half of 2019. Then into 2020 Covid. Woo hoo.
9462,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I Am truly sorry about your current situation. I Have been in your shoes with income concerns and job loss as a result of my shingles PHN and subsequent medical issues. I hope you are able to find a solution.
9465,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I Am from 86 and got vaccinated but it apparently did not work because I caught them when I was 16 and it was a nightmare. Shingles when I was about 27 too
9467,Shingles again?: Thank you for your reply. I Am slowly trying to work through everyone is response I appreciate this so much. I feel like I Am going nuts. The sensation is gone but now I have achey deep pains. Nothing I can see in my skin unless you REALLY look for it. And I remembered that back in December I had a crazy acne outbreak on my forehead that was uncharacteristic for me. Now I Am questioning that it was so painful and took weeks to heal. Needless to say I took the day off tomorrow lol and I will be heading to a walk in if I can. I see my regular doc at the end of the month. Ill definitely bring it up then Question Can you get PHN in a place different than the original outbreak?
9470,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I got shingles 2 years ago at 45 and yes I got the vaccine afterward. I am immune compromised so I did not want to take a chance. Shingles put me in the icu. I was not going to play around with that.
9471,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles last year at 38. Now that you mention it I think I do have lasting effects like nerve damage. Every now and then I still feel soreness on my forearm which was 1 of the areas affected.
9472,My September is so hectic that I am literally looking forward to the shingles vaccine in October as a kind of forced vacation Ugh. But I have had shingles and it is pure hell
9473,"Long Term Side Effects from Meningococcal vaccination. Nausea, muscle weakness, and insomnia: After receiving the meningococcal vaccine, I've been struggling with ongoing nausea, muscle weakness, and insomnia. It's been a few weeks since the vaccination, and these symptoms just won't subside. Doctors are running tests to figure out the root cause, but so far, no luck. Has anyone else experienced similar reactions to the meningococcal vaccine? Any tips on how to manage these side effects?"
9474,Shingles vaccine: I would not get it the day before thanksgiving. You Will feel like crap all day. Take it the day after and the effects last 2448 hours or so.
9476,Newbie here: This has eased my anxiety about potentially passing chickenpox to my 15 month old thank you Hopefully the poor little bugger does not contract it was due to get his vaccine at 18 months and I randomly got shingles a couple of days ago only just diagnosed properly today loudlycryingface
9477,How many women have taken cervical cancer vaccine or HPV vaccine?: Shots suck in general but I did not have any arm soreness or anything I think you get your first one and then it is 3 months until the next and then you go in 3 months later for the last.
9479,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: The last few vaccines have been from the Pharmacy. Doctor's offices do not seem to do them any more. The Shingles vaccine Shingrix was done at the local Pharmacy in two doses. You have to wait a few weeks between shots. Got the COVID and Flu shots at the same time in opposite arms. Did not hit me at all and felt fine afterward. Not sure if that is good or bad? I would space out the vaccines and do the Shingles shots whenever you want because they are not seasonal like the flu shots.
9480,Shingles vaccine experience: SHINGLES ARE NO FUN I was in excruciating pain for about a week. It went down my sciatic nerve into my right leg. You better believe I got the shots as soon as possible after that.
9486,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles. During pregnancy. On my face scalp and in my eye. Destroyed my cornea. Shingles fucking sucks and I have been dealing with the issues for 14 years and will for the rest of my life. The pain is horrific. Acupuncture saved me though since I could not take meds because of pregnancy. Get your shot.
9488,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: pro tip after getting any vaccine rub the injection site firmly for a minute or two not just 5 seconds really rub it and count oneone hundred twoone hundred to sixty. Then move your arm up down around and around. It looks stupid and you may have to rub your arm while you leave the pharmacy  doctor's office and get outside or to a hallway where you have enough room to swing your arm around ha. BUT it is worth it. It will really minimize or eliminate that soreness in your arm. And I have had friendsfamily who have had shingles and all agree that it is much worse than a day or two of arm soreness.
9489,Shingles vaccine experience: Just a sore arm. My dad had a miserable case mother in law had extended symptoms. I do not want that
9493,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I had shingles a few months ago. I Am 47. It was bad but not too bad. I was able to do WFH part days and come in part days. It was worst for about a week then less bad for another two. Had bumps on my arm and face. Lots of muscle pain especially in my armpit. Dr gave me herpes meds. Was first treated by telehealth doc then I was already scheduled to see my regular doc a week later by chance. We think its stress caused by workhome that triggered it. I Am just extremely busy lately but in a good way.
9496,COVID vaccine caused Shingles which looks exactly like MPOX

9502,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I have a condition called erythema multiforme and have to take 800 mg of acyclovir every day to prevent a cold sore flare up. It is the same anti viral they give for shingles. Should I go to my doctor before my annual exam to get a shingles vaccine or am I good to wait? I will ask him about whether or not I have to take it at all at my next exam just wondering if I need to rush.
9503,Shingles vaccine?: My husband is over 50 and just got the shingrix vaccine yesterday from Walgreens without a prescription and covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield. I think the prescription is only needed under 50 years old.
9505,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: The shots are not fun and you might feel like crap afterwards for a day or so but its much better than getting shingles.
9506,I was lucky to receive shingles as my first Christmas present on Christmas 2021 age 43. They appeared on my head face and eyelid. It was an awful experience. I ve had two c sections and back surgery. This nerve pain was so much worse. My pain lingered for months. I m sorry Mark had to experience this glad he was helped immediately and when you are old enough get your shingles vaccines

9509,Hi everyone. I am a gay man 29 recently out of a toxic relationship. My expartner and I both got tested before engaging in unprotected sex for the first time yet shortly after I began showing symptoms of both HPV on my booty and HSV coldsores on the mouth. This is when I learned that you cannot test for HPV in a penis and herpes was not included in the comprehensive STI test we took at Planned Parenthood. This was particularly frustrating for me because I had always used protection in any sexual situation that was not a committed monogamous partner. I thought I was doing everything right. My expartner never showed symptoms but given my history I had to assume that I contracted these viruses from him. Since he was apparently unaware of his status at the time I did not blame him and continued on in the relationship. Fast forward to a yearandahalf later when it was revealed to me that he had been cheating on me with multiple strangers from Grindr unprotected. I was devastated that someone I loved would continue to put my health at risk especially after witnessing the physical and emotional struggles around my sexual health that I was already facing. It became clear to me that he had a long history of unsafe sex before we began dating which was not made explicitly clear to me when we first started becoming intimate. Thankfully I am no longer in that relationship. I am taking some immuneboosting supplements which have seemed to help with the coldsores quite a lot. I have not had an outbreak in over two months now. The booty warts however are a little more stubborn. I have had two surgeries to get them removed both of which were extremely painful and traumatic and they are already starting to come back again. I fear that I will be dealing with these symptoms my whole life and even if I do miraculously become asymptomatic I will always be a carrier of these viruses and therefore always at risk of passing this along to someone else. I am thankfully no longer in this abusive relationship but fear that I will never find a fulfilling sex life again. I certainly do not want to put anyone else at risk and do not believe that any potential dating prospects would want to risk their health for me either. My plan moving forward is just to take things slow be open and honest about my status use protection and hope for the best. Are any of you HPV or HSV positive and able to have a safe and fulfilling dating life? Have any of you dated someone who is positive for these viruses and managed to have safe sex? How should I approach dating moving forward? Any advice from you all would be greatly appreciated.
9510,Never had a problem after getting shingles vac...
9512,Baby exposed to shingles: You have got the info from other comments but I would like to support you anecdotally that I gave my own 3 month old chickenpox because I had stress singles out of nowhere. While it was scary and very itchy we got through it relatively unscathed. We had to give my then 3 year old her first vaccine dose early and she did not even get it. Modern medicine has your back on this one.
9515,Did the RSV vaccine make you really sleepy?: Ah ok I do not think I felt anything with the tdap other than a sore arm But I was less antsy about it because I Have gotten in before in my life while RSV is a totally new one.
9524,Second Shingles Shot: Tried the shot a few years a go it put me in the hospital so I am going to have to just roll the dice.
9525,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Here to confirm that shingles in your nether regions is not a quest you want to accept. Also permanent bladder nerve damage really sucks. If I could go back I would have gotten the shot the day I turned 50.
9527,Shingles shot: I had no reaction to it whatsoever.
9530,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Shingles is terrible. If you have had chicken pox you can get shingles. I was in my late 50's. On a Thursday afternoon the back of my head felt tender like I had bumped but I knew I had not. The next morning I had a head ache but went on into work. Had a headache all weekend but had to be at work on Monday my boss was not in and I had to do her duties. My scalp itched a little but I was using a new shampoo and blamed the itch on that. I woke up Tuesday with a line of bumps down my forehead and my head felt like it would explode. My doctor took one look at me and knew I had shingles. I started on meds but the antiviral did not work because you have to start it within 48 hours and I was way past that. I missed 4 months of work. When I finally went back I had to roll my operating rom cap back off my forehead because it hurt if anything touched the skin.
9531,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I had incredible pain when my shingles were active and for the first three weeks were far worse than any pain I have ever experienced. By 6 weeks it felt like a bad sunburn or bruise someone was poking then slowly got back to feeling completely normal. But the acute actual pain was short lived.
9532,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I got the shingles during the height of the covid shutdown. I had a zoom with a nurse practitioner who thought the bumps were bacterial. Three days later i had what looked like a band from my back around my side and to my chest. I kept taking the antibiotics but after a couple more days I really could not make it through the night because of the pain so I went to the ER to wait another 4 hours while covid stuff was happening all around and nurses were in full biohazard suits with closed air systems it was nuts. They gave me antivirals around 4 AM and pretty much cleared by the pain later that same day. The lesions went away and now you cannot tell i had anything. I asked for the vaccine but was told 40 s is too young. F that
9533,I thought I was fine but maybe I am not. Absolutely exhausted.: My situation is very similar to yours. I Have had shingles before. I was 19 and I barely remember having symptoms just the rash and scabbing. Now at 33 I have it on my back and I have had all these symptoms along with it. I did not give shingles enough credit unfortunately. I Have been dealing with the intense back pain malaise fatigue as well. I Am on day 3 of the antiviral and am feeling better with more energy. I workout daily but have taken it easy this week taking days off. I just did an intense workout so I hope I do not kick myself for it later I Have also been getting itchy on my chest I Am praying its not going to show up there now anyway solidarity I hope you feel back to normal very soon.
9536,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shingles vaccine is the worst. But what is even worse is getting shingles And you only have to do 2 doses of the vaccine and then never again. Totally worth it
9538,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: OMG yes I want to say the cut off was 26 though. I turned 26 that year and was told I was not eligible. Missed it by MONTHS Also ended up getting HPV lots of uterine cysts a few biopsies a colposcopy  leep and both my pregnancies were considered high risk as a result which meant a lot more office visits and blood draws than I ever thought possible. I was somewhere in my late thirties when an OB finally said 'oh hey do you want this shot?' Hell yeah Get that s in my veins My 12yearold has had it already too.
9540,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I almost died at the ripe ole age of 4 from chickenpox. Hospitalization unconsciousness wildly high fevers other things I cannot remember but my mom claims it was the scariest thing she is ever had to deal with as a mother. I hope to ALL HELL I never get shingles..because clearly my body does not like this virus..or maybe I was just too little I do not know but it terrifies me. I was not brought to a chicken pox party. Probably picked it up in preschool or something or caught from my brother who only got a mild reaction. I was born in 89 so there was no vaccine at the time.
9542,Shingles on my face and scalp: Definitely get your eye checked at an ophthalmologist. Shingles in the eye can blind you. I had it in the same place the headache and scalp nerve pain was a special kind of hell. Advil 12 Hour was the only thing that helped
9543,First postshingles behind ear: Question have you developed actual pustules wrash or just burning redness and swelling? If you do not have pustules and you have not had blood work test positive that you are still fighting an infection post Covid consider Trigeminal Neuralgia Red Ear Syndrome yes it is really called that as differential diagnoses. I have had this as well got a full blown stroke work up due to facial numbness shooting nerve pain in face etc. I would say there is a lot of overlap in symptoms but not in outward physical appearance.
9544,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: This was my experience with both shot shots. Glad they are done I would do this yearly if I had to avoid shingles
9545,chicken pox 3 times shingles at 14: I also had chicken pox 3 times as a kid prior to age 8 and each time it got more severe. I Have had shingles as an adult while pregnant at age 31 and now I Am having a second bout of shingles at age 44. I was a sickly kid constantly ill and missed a lot of school because of it. I now have fibromyalgia and other immune issues but unsure if its related.
9546,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: Our son is also an ex 26weeker. He received the RSV vaccine shortly before he was discharged.
9549,"Can you get the vaccine after recovering from shingles under age 50??: Any idea about the US? I've been curious about this too - they make exceptions if you're immunocompromised, but I haven't heard anything about people who have had it."
9550,Shingles vaccine coffee: I had no side effects from either shot.
9551,meanwhile also wondering if a side effect of the shingles vaccine is recurring dreams of being punched by Carol Burnett? SheWasSoMean nightmare
9554,Shingles vaccine experience: Yeah I had the shingles vaccine a couple years back. My mother had gone thru a bout of it and I was like none of that for me thanks. I do not remember any ill effects aside from the sore arm.
9555,I Have had 4 which is just as many as shingles vaccine. Got Covid once this past Christmas and I felt fine after 48 hours.
9557,Shingles vaccine experience: Just got it four days ago and no side effects other than a sore arm.
9561,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Omg so sorry for you I wonder if a doctor is able to overrule the 50 yr rule. They do it for all kind of other medications call it off label use. I did not have shingles in seventh grade but I had severe acne. So even though it was a different disease I can still kind of empathize. I hope you can get the shingles vaccine but if you do take my advice and do it on Friday before a three day weekend. it really kicked my butt
9563,Second Shingles Shot: I have got scars on my face and legs. Tons on my face and jawline. I also got adult acne after that. It sucks.
9572,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: In case you were not aware shingles often starts as a square or rectangle rash around your mid section. If you see something like this go to a doctor immediately. They can often stop it early. This happened to my husband when he was in his 40's.
9573,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles in my mid 30s. A small bout of it on my left side torso. Was not so bad thankfully. I first thought it was a mild poison ivy rash. Doctor suggested I get the shingles vaccine which I guess is recommended for most people regardless? i do not know.
9575,Can shingles spread all over your body? And can it be another form of chicken pox?: I am in an active case of shingles left arm face and neck and I had three individual blisters itchy and sore appearing on my opposite arm today almost in the exact spots where the original infection started on my left arm. I did some reading of previous posts etc and understand this might be 'disseminated' shingles? although your case sounds a lot more severe. I hope you feel better soon.
9577,Shingles related to Covid? Pain months ahead outbreak: I also have been having stabbing underarm pain on my left side since right after I had a case of Covid in September of 2023 and then now 10 days ago I broke out in shingles of my left side T11T12 dermatome after going through IVF treatment which was extremely stressful. But I also had what I have suspected to be Ramsay Hunt Syndrome since May of 2022 after a heavy case of stress as well. I have been getting looked at by UCLA for every possible because for the past 2 years with no answers until this outbreak of shingles. I am hoping that is all this is and is not linked to something else underlying. But I am almost 1000 sure they would have caught any other reason with all the MRIs and CTs I have had. I did find out I have degenerativebulging discs in my neck though.
9579,Shingles and other Vaccines: I am due for my second shingles shot in a week. The first one took me three days to recover from. I had shingles in my 40s however and do not ever want to get it again. Had it on my torso and it hurt so much. Lasted a few weeks and I had to work through it too as did not have the vacation time to take time off.
9580,Lyme and Bartonella for 29 years Rant: Hey op my story is eerily similar. I really started going downhill after shingles and I cannot believe that people think I am making this shit up after I pretended to be healthy at all cost for a decade and literally powered through til I no longer could walk lol
9581,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got my first shot got shingles and then the second dose. I can attest shingles absolutely suck. Get the vaccine.
9582,How many women have taken cervical cancer vaccine or HPV vaccine?: oh I am so sorry I should not have just assumed you were in the same country USA. I hope you are able to figure it out in your country with your doctors and get vaccinated. just a little arm soreness but if you survived the COVID shotsboosters this is no different than getting the tetanus booster I AM GOING TO.
9583,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had Shingles about 8 years ago. I went to my doctor knowing I would woken up with it had seen it on others he then proceeded to call an ambulance because it was in one eye and could lead to blindness. I was in isolation for 7 days and received antiviral I.V. amongst other meds during that time.It was in my left eye and on that brow and whole left side of my scalp and left eyelid. I have scarring in my eye that has been identified as being from Shingles. Gross but when the scabs fell off that brow all the hair fell out with them. I had no left eyebrow for months. Rubbing in castor oil daily helped it grow back. I was left with a very deep indented scar on my forehead and on my left eyebrow. After the rash left I still felt feverish and the pain and sensitivity in my scalp and eyelid never went away. I was diagnosed with a condition that can occur after Shingles called Post Herpetic Neuralgia. I was told it is one of the most painful conditions known to man. It hurts to comb my hair to sleep on that side to put on eye makeup so I usually do not anymore. I am told I cannot get the vaccine because it is live and I could get Shingles again. I should add I have a rare autoimmune disease and that and the meds are a factor.If you can get the vaccine get it Shingles are no joke
9585,I Have had both. The vaccine is bad but shingles is so much worse. Just horrid. The vaccine is worth it.
9587,Shingles vaccine: Vaccine is better than getting shingles. I have shingles now
9596,I thought I had a bug bite or spider bite a few days ago. Was super itchy but figured it would go away. One small looking spot turned into a cluster of them on my upper back and side of boob. I am in SO much pain. Went to urgent care today and sure enough its shingles. I got on an antiviral medication unsure if it will work since its been a few days since the initial spots. I Am also having gastrointestinal issues with it. I have two toddlers and a 10 week old as well. Super scared they are going to get chicken pox. Toddlers vaccinated baby is not How do you manage the pain? I feel like I can barely function.
9601,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: He started out with lower back pain. He said it felt like his muscle ripped and the nerves were damaged. When I saw the boils I thought it could be related but he thought it was two separate things. To both you and undercurrents thank you so much I was able to look up pictures of shingles and translated it into Japanese so that he can see how deadon shingles is. He also knows how serious shingles can be so I was able to convince him of the urgency to get it checked out. Unfortunately he will not take the time off so we have to wait til Saturday morning but it is a step in the right direction.
9605,I have a mild case of shingles but for the entire time I have had the rash I have been completely and utterly exhausted. I can manage maybe 10 minutes of mild physical exertion before I am completely spent. I get a full night's rest every night but wake up every day feeling friend and in desperate need of more sleep. I had to go back to my dr last night for a checkup and brought up how tired I am. He said it is not related to the shingles at all probably just the medicine he gave me interacting with some other medicine I take  even though the last dose was 5 days ago. The exhaustion is not getting any better and I do not know what to do. It is so bad that it is affecting my work and school. Am I just stuck like this? I am pretty sure I am going to fail at everything if I am...
9606,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: And shingles can be very painful and serious. A friend of mine had it and was bedridden and in pretty bad pain for several weeks.
9609,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: The burning pain from shingles made me want to take as hot a bath as I could to try and stop the pain. I too was happy for the shingles vaccine.
9613,First shingles vaccine side effects: Yes same side effect of tiredness. Delta and bed rest got me through it.
9614,Benefits and Side Effects of the Shingles Vaccine: I have multiple sclerosis and received mine age 52. No side effects except a sore arm. Vaccinations save lives time and money.
9615,Been on bender last two weeks got first dose today should I wait to take?: That Is what made me interested in it. I Am not worried about drinking once I am on it purely about risk of major pancreatic side effects w the first dose.
9617,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My friend got shingles in her eye and the top of her head. I ran to Walgreens to get the shots.
9620,Shingles: Shingles was the single most painful thing to happen to me besides childbirth. So sorry you are experiencing this too. Mine was a year ago and I thought it would never end.
9621,Shingles on face: Yup I have had multiple outbreaks of facescalp shingles and they always start with the headaches exhaustion and light sensitivity. I am glad you are on the antivirals.
9622,Mom ruined my life by not letting me get the hpv vaccine: Of the two young women who took the early HPV vaccine in my family two had serious adverse events. Later I looked at the actual reported adverse event data and I would never suggest anyone take it especially since the manufacturer said their vaccine had NOT been proven to prevent cancer that had been associated with HPV.
9624,Pregnancy vaccines: I got the tdap and flu which are pretty standard from my OB. They actually did not offer or recommended RSV or covid for me. I did have COVID during my second trimester it was no fun I do not recommend. I was personally a little surprised about the tdap because I had just gotten it in 2022 and was educated on the benefits of it during pregnancy to transfer through the umbilical cord and help with immunity in the early days. The flu shot is standard because of my job which is why I agreed to it. My friend had trouble finding the RSV vaccine for herself because her office did not offer it so I believe that is why its not standard within my OB.
9628,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: That said my husband got his first case in some unusual way on his torso and it was only itchy and slightly painful though his was correctly identified and treated earlier then mine.
9633,Shingles vaccine: Same. It was not that bad at all. And my mom had shingles a few years ago and I Have never seen someone suffer so much for so long. She almost lost her vision in one eye. Get the shot
9636,"Left hand is red, swollen, but not warm: Looking for advice for my aunt 60F. Her left hand is visibly swollen and red compared to her right hand. Notably, it's not warm and is the same temperature as her right hand. She mentioned feeling tightness/heaviness in the affected hand. She visited the emergency room two days ago, but the doctors were unable to determine the cause and discharged her. One of the discharge papers mentioned the possibility of deep vein thrombosis, but it was ruled out along with arterial occlusion. They recommended another ultrasound during her upcoming follow-up appointment. Tests conducted indicated normal bloodwork and good circulation. The tests included duplex ultrasound, blood tests, and a procedure involving dye injection into a port in her hand. There were no known bites, scratches, or visible injuries. She had received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on August 16th. Any insights or similar experiences would be helpful."
9637,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: I was fortunate and had no side effects from either shot
9638,Shingles vaccine experience: That Is what I kept telling myself when I wanted to bitch about my itchy sore arm. Its still better than nerve pain and blisters and scarring.
9640,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: 55 here friend had a case that went across their eye and has permanently damaged their vision. I went and got the vaccine that weekend.. Shot 1 was fine but damn if the second one is not a kick in the dick.
9641,Hives outbreak  Emergency room: I have you rtica ria from past two months and got the first dose of shin gri x 6 months back. But the second dose has to be done within 6 months of first dose. I did not know this will make my you rtica ria uncontrollable slightly frowning face
9642,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: But you are scared of vaccines right?
9643,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Yes I was wearing my husbands tshirts for a couple weeks. Could Not wear regular pants for a month. To be honest the itching was not as bad as the pain. It just hurt more than anything. Can you ask the gyno if you can do anything. Shingles gives you odd weird pains and sensations. It ruin my whole last summer. It is hard to concentrate.
9649,I mask everywhere and for the plane I have a sip valvewell fitting aura  covixyl and stoggles. Very low on packing space and am choosing to not buybring a personal air purifier though. I Have never had covid and would like to be prepared in case I do get it despite my efforts. I cannot get paxlovid my doctor sucks and is super conservative in her treatment approach only gives it to cancer patients etc So far I Am packing a thermometer and rapid tests Famotidine can help with cytokine storms DGL can stimulate the mucus membranes to repair themselves nattoserra supplement to help prevent microclots Tylenol for if I get too bad a fever.also will have CPC mouthwash on hand iotacarrageenan nasal spray. I am very low on packing space and figure I can buy a Neti pot over there if needed but can bring saline packs for making the mixture. what else should I add? Anyone else know of any cool supplementsmedicines that would help protect against covid damage? As far as the possibility of finding a different doc to get paxlovid I Am not sure any doc would prescribe it in advance before even getting sick first of all. Also I cannot take NSAIDs or anything harsh on my stomach issues and I heard paxlovid is similarly harsh on the stomach. A bad stomach flare up can affect my heart and give me POTSlike symptoms and other effects for months so it would have to REALLY be worth that to take something harsh. Ie I might be a bad candidate for paxlovid anyway. At the same time 6 months of bad stomachheart symptoms might be better than some other more permanent longcovid things I really do not know. Since it would be my first infection I Am leaning towards not worrying about getting paxlovid. I got vaccine in late September. I think that might be close enough to my January trip that it would not make sense to try to get a second dose especially since I think i do get mild heart side effects from it way better than the mRNA vaccine side effects I got though and I do not want to be getting irregular heartbeats while on an 8 hour flight if I got another dose 2 weeks before the trip. Or maybe its worth it? Thoughts? I do not want to take 2 vaccines at once and if I get another it might make more sense to get the flu or rsv vaccine since instead I have not had those yet so that is one idea. But maybe a second vaccine would still be better? Ok sorry for the long post and thanks for any recommendations
9652,Freezing Outdoor Music Class: Yes I was so happy my 5 month old was able to get the RSV vaccine Since she cannot get flu and she is currently sick with a coldear infection
9653,I was watching a YouTube video on Dystonia . This is from Hope of Dystonia . Title  The real because of Dystonia He mentioned herpes . I find this interesting because I received the shingle shot  then I had HSV1 of the genitals and Dystonia all come out within weeks of each other. I have not slept with anyone I Have been single since Jan 2023. So either it was dormant . I Am taking antivirals and supplements to keep it at bay. I do not want to ever experience it again . Any thoughts ? Thank you
9654,28yo F Hello I recently got diagnosed with shingles when I went to the clinic. I initially thought I had a bad right ear infection and it was spreading to the right side of my head and felt like my head and ear were getting electrocuted. One look from the doc and he said I had shingles. I went to the clinic a day after I noticed symptoms and was put on 1g of Valacyclovir three times a day for a week and I had rashes on my forehead close to my eye but more so on my scalp. First 24 days I could not brush my hair and I still felt that same pain so I kept myself relaxed and got plenty of sleep. I Am now a week after getting shingles and none of my rashes had blisters so I Am worried if I need to follow up on the meds? There Is still some itching but the pain is all gone but I Am just scared it will come back since I never got to the usual stage where they said the blisters would pop and scab over. I only had marks from my rashes now so I Am very confused on what to do?
9655,I felt awful too but apparently its way better than actually getting a bad case of shingles which my friend had and was miserable for weeks. The second shot was not quite as bad. Plan for a few days of Netflix and rest. Feel better
9657,I Have had shingles and got the vaccine after. The shingles made me cry and my tolerance for pain is high. No reaction to the vaccine at all.
9659,Shingles Sucks: Omg you are one of the few people I have heard that gets it regularly. Sometimes I will go months without an outbreak. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 different lesions continuously breaking out for a month or more. Mine is on my sciatic nerve. When it is really bad it is like electrical shocks going down my leg.
9660,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: While you are at it get the RSV shot. I think RSV is worse than Covid. I got it and it did severe permanent lung damage. There Is no cure. As an aside why are these vaccinations not covered? They pushed the Covid vaccine like drug dealers and ignored these serious vaccines.
9663,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Wait why would parents want their kids to contract it? What am I missing? I am not a millennial not even a Gen X or but I am right at the cusp of Boomer to Gen X and I had it as a kid do not remember how I caught it probably at school younger sister had it too. I guess I am not understanding why parents of Millennials would want their kids to get chicken pox? I am guessing you all know but in case you do not anyone who has had the chickenpox is susceptible to Shingles as you age. If you decide to get the Shingles vaccine the newer one which is called Shingrix is way more effective than the older Shingles vaccine be sure to set yourself a good 5 days after that you do not absolutely have to do something in case you get bad side effects. I do not normally get side effects from vaccines and I never have from any other vaccine but the shingrix vaccine makes about one 1 in 5 people very ill from side effects. I was one of the 1out of five and I had no idea about the side effects That was only a couple of years ago and they really were not good about warning people not the doctor's offices or the grocery store clinics. I mention it because it was a really big deal for me I had no idea that it was going to have any side effects at all much less than that I was going to be the second sickest I have ever been as an adult and I definitely could not have worked or anything else I was basically out of life for a week It was scary as hell because I did not know what was going on until I put 22 together looked it up online and then read a ton of other stories from people who were affected the same as me. I was so lethargic that laying in bed I was not sure if I could get up and walk 15 steps to the bathroom My sister otoh had no side effects at all. I did a lot of research afterwards and I did discover that most people had one extreme or the other they either got super sick like I did or had no symptoms at all like my sister. There is not much in between.
9666,Developed shingles a couple days ago which I am surprisingly okay with. I have some prescription cream and had my chicken pox shot when I was a child but 22 years old and I am still getting fucked over. I could not get anyone to take me seriously at first because they thought I was too young to have shingles so I as someone who has debilitating OCD jump to the next rational conclusion bed bugs. I tear my living space apart and find no sign. Now I know it is shingles. I have the nerve pain to show for it. I have the prescription cream. Along with the nerve issues I know it can because formication which I have been struggling with worse than usual but none of that matters in my head. Every little bump especially if they happen to form even the sloppiest of lines makes me fear that it is actually bed bugs and not shingles. I am so tired. I feel disgusting and I fucking HURT. It burns and aches. It is causing sciatica symptoms because one of my patches are right where sciatica pain tends to come from. I have it on my calf two spots on my thigh and who knows where else I have missed. I feel like I am in hell. Not really looking for advice since there is not really any to be had but it is welcome. I just needed to rant. I have to get back to work on Sunday and have no idea how I am going to make it through. On top of all of it my bed bug anxiety is driving me insane to the point I cannot sleep. I have not had an OCD flare up this bad in a while.
9667,Shingles vaccine: Shingles was the single worst pain of my life. I was always fatigued. But that was not a problem . It was the nerve pain. I had a rash under my left arm probably an inch below to the left of my left breast. If I ever touched the rash it gave me goosebumps. If I ever got goosebumps every nerve in my entire body was on fire. I would lock up and tighten every muscle hoping to reduce the pain hoping it would stop. If I laughed too hard if a cold breeze hit my skin if I sneezed I would get goosebumps. I had no idea what this was. 2 weeks later it was finally over and I had my annual doctor appointment . When he saw the remnants of the rash he was surprised I had already gotten shingles at 26 .
9668,The first does of the shingles vaccine is BRUTAL. The 2nd one?? SO MUCH WORSE. Worth it in the long run but OMG so Brutal.
9669,I was all ready for a rough day when I got my shingles vaccine. But I lucked out and felt great. Some people have a hard time though. But like the ad says Shingles does not care. Get the shot.
9670,Shingles vaccine under 50?: I had the shingles vaccination in my mid 40s per recommendation from my gastroenterologist. I Am 57 now and was told to get Shingrex last fall and now I Am regretting that I did not as I Am in an outbreak
9673,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I sympathize. I had shingles in my 30 s and it was far and away the worst pain I have ever felt.
9674,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: This looks exactly like when I had shingles thankfully it was only on my stomach and back
9679,I need to get the new vaccine had Shingles and Pneumonia a few weeks ago and they killed me for three days so...I would actually welcome no response to the Covid or the Flu
9680,Hi looking for advice. I just received my Tysabri Infusion on Wednesday this is my 20th and I am feeling pretty bad running low grade fevers with headaches around the clock. Now this morning I woke up with itching and pain on my left ribcage it is shingles and steadily worsening with shooting pains and has traveled around my back. I have not received the vaccine. I am concerned about PML. The box warning is to call neurologist immediately. Any advice or recommendations are truly appreciated. Thank you.
9683,I was bitten by a bat a year ago and when I read this story it broke my heart and terrified me because I too did not think much of a bat bite... it is literally a joke I was on a hike that took too so it was dark and this area was full of bats. I grabbed onto a rock above me and did not notice a bat was there but it made me know. The bite was a joke and I forgot about it and BARELY registered the event. I actually thought I might have grabbed some cactus or other prickly thing if i did not see this black thing the size of a small sparrow flying around like it was drunk. I know that drunk flight already from living in bat areas so I realized it was a bat but the bite was still so inconsequential I kept wondering if it was not just a scratch. Then I got home and forgot about it. It was not till a week later at breakfast with my old mother that she insisted I get shots. It is ironic because my mother is kind of vaccine she had a bad experience with shingles after getting the early COVID shot but I guess being rural she is all too familiar with rabies. So I went to the doctor just to please my mother. At least they do not poke you in the which was what my mother thought I would get yeah we are out of touch bite me. I got a shot in the arm with a tiny needle which barely registered like the bat bite lol although I got a mild fever that night. I got four more shots over that month no more reactions though. I was tested for rabies twice and learned why testing me is inferior to testing the animal. My first test was negative. It was not till the final test a month later that it came out barely positive. The doc explained that testing a human for the rabies virus is unreliable because rabies hides in nerves not the blood. Even at a month detection is unreliable. So you should bring in the animal if possible. If not then it is just safer to take the vaccine even if you test negative. I realized that if I would left it to myself I would likely be dead today like that poor teacher because it felt like a scratch. This is why I remind all of you hikers IF YOU GET A BITE EVEN A TINY JOKE OF A SCRATCH BITE AS LONG AS IT MIGHT BE A BITE GET THE RABIES VACCINE.  I include a video of the area I got bitten but I did not get bitten on the date the video was taken I was bitten in the late summer of 2023. Also I said 'mammal' and though technically birds and some reptiles have been reported to get rabies the distinction is only of interest to academics and If in doubt get the rabies jab.  minor spellinggrammar edits
9685,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Yeah I was very happy to get mine. Had a coworker whose husband got shingles on his face and on his eyeball. He did not lose eyesight over it but it was incredibly painful
9691,Shingles vaccine: I Do Not Know I was scheduled to get my first shot and ended up with shingles. Had no idea just thought it was a random skin infection. Whoops. Was Not a big deal to be honest. Ill get the shots soon.
9692,Hello I have been having this problem for about 2 years now. After having intercourse I also see a little bleeding when going to toilet. It hurts during the inserting part after a little adjusting it is ok. Depends on the day. It only happens with the pens I tried with a medium size toy and also fingers and it does not hurt then. In the first couple of months I was thinking that maybe it was the position or something or maybe I was not turned on. But it was not the case. I went to gyno and they gave me a lube cream which did not help like at all. I went to another gyno and she still ignored that concern as I described my pain external like it does not hurt me inside but just the skin of the entrance  bulb of vestibule or vaginal opening I am not sure I went to another one and he was the nicest one but still only prescribed internal washing with baking soda and water. Please help me as I really want to have a normal intimate life again. I have only ever been with my partner and the first 4 years were ok. I have done yearly pap and HPV test and all were good. I also did the HPV vaccines. As the test for my last vaginal secretions it came out with Escherichia coli Ecoli I did the treatmentthe tearing is still there I did not have intercourse during or after the treatment only after the time period passed and I have another my next checkup in January. Regarding endometriosis I had a MRI scan which came with level 23 but it was very weird because after going switching to my last doctor he told me that a lot of pacients came to have surgery for endo removal from my last clinic where I had my MRI done and the girls were cut open and had nothing inside  No endometriosis. He told me that my ovaries and everything looked normal were flexible no pain when doing the tests and exam I did not have pain anymore during my cycle as I changed my diet and my menstruation was normal and regular. I am very stressed by this and I feel like all the doctors I went to ignored it. I think sometimes it may be a little itchy the intimate part but I am not so sure as I read a lot of stuff on the internet and I may be influenced. I am sorry about any mistakes English is not my first language
9697,PSA Vaccinated? Yes you CAN still get shingles: Ha I am glad you noticed that I am in rural Mexico but it was super easy to find the typical drugs and just go get them rolling on the floor laughing On the face get outta here Terrible I do think the vaccine made it minor but who knows
9698,Shingles vaccine experience: My Hubby had to take Immunosuppressive Therapy for a Kidney Disease called FSGS thankfully he was vaccinated or his Disseminated Shingles which spread to the Myelin Sheath at C4  C5 and caused Right side Paralysis could have been worse. GET THE VACCINE especially if you are Immunocompromised
9700,Shingles again?: How are you doing now? I hope you are feeling better? I have had the pains on and off now since the beginning and I have the worst skin sensitivity at times in areas on arms and torso. I also had a weird rash by my belly button but it did not blister then faded. I also think 'what if?' I am convinced I have got MCAS and hEDS but the physio just kind of shrugged and said I have hypermobile spectrum symptoms and fibromyalgia ones too but as I am already on max dose pregabalin that would treat the fibro. I do not even know if that counts as a diagnosis or not. I am waiting on bowel screening tests arriving. I am obviously finding it hard not freaking out that the c word is lurking. Bloody health anxiety is shit. I really need to see an immunologist so I have made a GP appt for next month to request a referral. I know I have had poor health with cPTSD nervous system dysreulation being a factor but I have good physical strength and was always fit and active. I eat healthily. I just seem to have collected co morbidities left right centre.
9701,Shingles Vaccine?: Definitely get it I got disseminated varicella which is just spread out shingles. I spent 17 days in the hospital.
9709,I Am 59 years old. About 10 years ago I had a very mild case of shingles on my leg the area was about 10 x 15 cm. Three years after that I had an even milder case. I would not have noticed the second one if it were not for the exact same location it was so mild like a minor sunburn. With this history is there any reason to get the vaccine? Thanks.
9715,"Did anyone else develop a rash from the HPV vaccine?: Hey all, I recently got the HPV vaccine as part of my routine vaccinations. However, a few days after receiving the shot, I noticed a rash developing on my arm where the injection was given. It's been itchy and uncomfortable. Has anyone else experienced a skin reaction like this from the HPV vaccine? Hoping this rash clears up soon, but curious to know if others have had similar side effects. ---"
9716,: Horrendous Can you suggest any practical way of testing for the presence of this in the bloodstream. Is this something we can do or work on? I feel it might be happening to me right now inside I have had continuingdeveloping symptomsproblems since the first vaccination rollout. If it is detected in a live subject what then? Any ideas?
9718,Mom ruined my life by not letting me get the hpv vaccine: For what it is worth I had the HPV vaccine and I have still been dealing with a persistent HPV infection for like 7 years now. Not to say the vaccine is not worth it. It did protect me from the most highrisk strains but I got by a different moderaterisk strain.
9721,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Apparently I was vaccinated but I still got a mild case at 11. It was an itchy and embarrassing weekend.
9722,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: thanks. just wanted to make sure this is normal.
9724,Sad. Almost Everybody I love got vaccinated multiple times. I find myself waiting for them to drop like flies. My sister died already from the shots. A friend has had several strokes and is now blind. A niece got GBS after . Many acquaintances have suffered shingles.
9727,Yes I also had the same reaction to the shingles vaccine
9728,Shingles Is NO Joke: Got the newer 2 dose version in 2023. My doctor told me to wait until it was available since its apparently more effective than the older version. So glad I did because I could not imagine Shingles pain on top of my sciatica pain and lower vertebrae pain.
9733,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Might feel like a mild flu. But it beats getting shingles
9734,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Are you immunized to chicken pox? Are you sure you did not have an extremely mild case? my second case of chicken pox I had 6 sores. The first I had 10 If you have been vaccinated against chicken pox go get a titer to check your immunity.
9738,You may be eligible for an RSV vaccine now: Thanks for posting Asthma and a hx of pneumonia for me. I hope to get flu covid and rsv vaccines this fall. I Am tired of losing more of my hearing with each covid infection even after 4 vaccinations on board. I also have the pneumococcal vaccine on board because my Dr suggested it with my history. That one was gnarly in that I actually noticed the side effects.
9740,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I did. Unfortunately my wife did not and she got the shingles. She was in utter agony for weeks. You do not want that take my word for it. Get the vaccine.
9741,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: I got a case in my 40s that was a huge pain and took weeks to resolve. So yeah anecdotal not a big deal posts not helpful.
9746,"Received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and the side effects were no joke. Sore arm, chills, and fatigue hit me hard. I'm scheduled for the second dose soon, but I'm honestly dreading it. Can anyone share their experience with the second Moderna shot? Trying to gather the courage to go through with it!"
9747,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My daughter hsd the RSV vaccine at 37 weeks and had no problems with it. And then we were discharged. A week later she picked up some upper respiratory virus which was not RSV and we had 2 hospital admissions over it discharged then readmitted again. It was scary. they are so youngtheir lungs may be well enough developed for everything except challenges like this.
9748,My A1C was 6.4 three months ago. Recently after getting flu and shingles shots at a pharmacy I went to hospital to have blood drawn for an A1C test. The reading was 7.2 Do vaccinations affect A1C readings? Increase blood sugar readings? A bit concerned.
9752,I am due the last week of February which I know is still part of RSV season. I was very on board with getting the maternal RSV vaccine until realizing that the protection window is approximately until the baby is 6 months old. I have instead considered waiting until the fall for the RSV antibody shot beyfortus that is currently available for babies who are under 8 months of age. Children whose mothers receive the maternal RSV vaccine are not eligible for beyfortus or I would 100 just do both. For context my son was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks with much of the time in the PICU when he was just over 6 months old in November 2022 due to RSV. We do not mess with RSV in this house. So anyway I am trying to weigh the options of the maternal vaccine that will protect the baby basically MarchAugust or opt to wait until she is 6 or 7 months old and protect her for the fall. I asked about this in my due date group and a few folks who were helpful and not telling me about how they are not getting any vaccines at all said they would rather have protection for that tail end of RSV season when the baby is tiny so I understand that rationale but I guess I am so stuck on how sick my son got in the fall while also being past the 6 month window. It may be relevant to share that my son is in preschool and would be bringing home germs but the baby herself will not be in formal childcare until September which I also find to be a higher risk time. I guess I am just looking for reassurance that if I get the vaccine now I will not be regretting the lessened protection the baby would have come the fall or conversely would like support of opting for the antibodies insuead. Could anyone who is having a baby in February or March share which one they are doing and why?
9754,Shingles second shot update.: I was fine after my second shot.
9755,I have severe attacks every hour or less that leaves me curled in a ball screaming. I had shingles on my face and neck. About 3 days ago I developed the symptom of extreme burning cramping pain everywhere the rash was. No pain medication has been able to help. Right up to straight morphine injections. Nothing. I am on a really high dose of gabapentin already and I have tried topical. Lidocaine cream just sends me into an immediate attack. This pain makes me want to die. I literally can only scream when it happens. Last time I even peed my pants from screaming so hard. My throat is blown out.
9759,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Hi I am a public health professional. If you had gotten chicken pox later in life late teens even your outcome would likely have been really rough. Late infection of chicken pox are often more prolonged and severe. So while definitely not preferable to getting vaccinated it was better to get chicken pox younger rather than later. Shingles is awful. I Am sorry you are dealing with this. My dad got shingles in his 40s and it was very painful. He also got chicken pox in his 20s and he nearly had to go to the hospital. It was brutal compared to his sisters who got infected as younger kids. There is a shingles vaccine that you can ask your doctor about to reduce the risk of future shingles outbreaks. Usually it is recommended for people 50 and older or those with compromised immune systems but it does not hurt to ask.
9761,I decided to do both the shingrix and covid vaccine at the same time just to get the reactions over with.
9765,THE 39TRIPLEDEMIC39... Should Parents be Worried? RSVFluCovid Dr. Paul Retired Pediatrician: Felt this way after my second covid round. My first round of covid I was 22 weeks pregnant and on a ventilator for a week due to pneumonia. Second round pregnant again around 15 weeks first few days were rough but we made it through praise God. I was like we made it
9768,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick but my arm hurt ALOT for a long time like a week and a half. But having had a flare up of shingles in my 40s it was worth it. Never want that again.
9769,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I do not get shots or vaccines unless i think they are absolutely necessary and I do not get annual flu shots. however I did get the shingles and pneumonia vaccines earlier this year. 6 months later I am now recovering from pneumonia. hopefully the shingles vaccine works out better.
9774,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I tell everyone the shot itself HURTS and I was sick for the weekend but I would rather be sick for a week than get shingles.
9775,I am 82 still suffering nerve issues from shingles Dec 2019. Followed in Mar 2020 w4 Covid vaccinations which increased the nerve issues. I wear a mask as I am not having a vac again. I wear a mask to protect by 84 yr old husband who since hip replacement has gone down hill.
9776,Shingles shot Ack: Yeah most vaccines make my body go haywire for a day or two. Everyone needs to make sure to have some Tylenol on hand and maybe some coconut water for hydration. Be prepared to sleep a lot too.
9777,TN and shingles vaccine: I asked my neuro about my shingles outbreak and whether or not it could have caused my TN. He said it was unlikely becuase my shingles was in my thoracic region and the virus tends to stay in its zone. But really? I mean seems like this vaccince reaction and the peripheral nerve damage caused by shingles would be linked to TN. I hear you all I am not yet 50 but advocated to get the vaccine because I wanted to avoid any more links to TN flare ups.
9778,Notalgia Parasthetica: Interesting I had an itch in just that spot for 2 weeks was driving me MAD.... Now I have shingles along that entire nerve bundle. Are we having FUN YET??
9783,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: It just made me tired for a day or so. Probably a good idea to schedule it late in the day and make sure you don't have anything critical at work the next day, or do it late on a day before you have some time off, like a weekend."
9786,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: This  a former coworker  acquaintance has had repeated flares since I Have known him 16 years and they are debilitating painful
9790,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had chickenpox as a child and a couple of mild bouts with shingles in my 40s so I figured this would be a breeze. I was so wrong. And yes I know its better than getting actual shingles but its a far cry from you will just be a little tired lol
9791,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: That Is just the was the way it was done in the 70s. And as someone who is endured both Shingrex injections you have my deepest sympathy. They say its 100x better than getting Shingles but JFC those shots sucked.
9794,Hi docs I 30F feel silly asking this but I went to get a vaccine early this morning hpv if that matters and something felt off. The nurse disinfected my arm with an alcohol wipe and while they waited for it to dry they went back to their computer and to mess around for a bit. Then they did the injection and as they tried to put a bandaid on they wiped my blood with their bare finger? They sanitized their hands when I entered the room but not after using the computer. I was already feeling nervous about getting the vaccine and I was so shocked I froze in place and did not say anything. Now I Am worried about the potential risk for infection. I was able to clean the area with an alcohol wipe maybe 5 mins later but still. Am I right to be concerned? Are there any risks of contamination? Thank you for your help
9795,Shingles vaccine: When I turned 50 I got the shingles in 1 arm and my flu shot in the other. Shingles hurt a little more than the flu 2nd shingles shot was fine. You DO NOT want shingles I Am a pharmacist I see a lot of people suffer with shingles. For some the nerve pain lingers for months.
9796,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Mine took a few weeks to get noticeably better. There was still aching and shocks that would come and go for a few months after. Now I get twinges like being pinched with a needle when it gets aggravated but its 99 better
9797,RSV Shot: Hell yea Got it a few days after his 4 month shots. He has not had notable reactions to any of them so far  and this was no different. Fun fact Beyfortus is not technically a vaccine where your body is exposed to a version of the virus and makes its own antibodies. Its actually monoclonal antibodies  ie the antibodies are what is injected so its effective almost immediately rather than a couple weeks later after your immune response.
9799,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: The second dose WALLOPED me but I think that s how it usually goes
9802,Shingles vaccine: I got it At the time there was a shortage of the second dose. I managed to get both though and had virtually no side effects. I Have had a mild case of shingles and never ever want to experience a more serious case.

9805,Community notes are right. Having said that as mentionedstated previously Moneky Pox is the cover damage done to Immune System by the COVID 19 Vaccination resulting in Shingles Autoimmune Blistering Disease Herpes. Shingles does not look like that either. I have had it lol
9807,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Got itchy hives all over my loins for a day or two but other than that nothing major. Thankfully it did not block my potential powerfully potent romantic trysts. My personality already put a stop to that years ago
9808,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Still have the scars to remember the itchiest time in my life. Countless experiences with severe hives is still better than the itch I felt. Missed a fair 100 degrees outside my brother living it up calamine lotion oatmeal baths could not go hang with my grandma. My husband said his mom's partner at the time put him in a salt and bleach bath. I said wtf. That sounds awful. He had shingles a few months ago and I hope I never have to deal with them.
9809,Shingles vaccine experience: Whatever you all do do not get your Shingrix shot and your flu shot simultaneously. I spent two days under all the blankets in the house trying to get warm.
9810,Shingles vaccine: I literally just got my 1st round of it today. I was told it was going to hurt like hell going in for me it did not. Its been 6 hours since I had it and I Am definitely tired but nothing hurts yet. The pharmacist said that round 2 is the one that will because side effects of aches and pains
9812,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I did it last fallwinter. I have had clients and friends deal with shingles. I will take feeling sick for a day or two after the shot over shingles any day of the week. Get your shot. And maybe plan to take the next day or two off.
9813,Shingles vaccine experience: Measles vaccine does not last a lifetime. My daughter's MMR protection did not even last 20 years
9814,Pls Take Fenbendazole or Ivermectin A bunch of people who took the C19 vaccine start having lateonset reactions like Shingles and they are trying to utilize this to say that it is this other thing called mpox and go through the whole lockdown and restrictions thing again.
9815,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Thanks I do think I had something coming on and got smacked by the vaccine and a new medication. I need to feel better soon. My doctor did say that everyone is very sick right now Covid and other stuff. Like worse than the start of the pandemic.
9816,Shingles vaccine: I had to have the chicken pox vaccine 2 doses 30 days apart and the pharmacist said to anticipate the same level or worse when its time to get the shingles onenot looking forward to it. I was basically ill for two months. However? Definitely better in every single way that getting the chicken pox in my then 30s.
9819,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I am so very sorry. Glad to read that you have seen an ophthalmologist. I hope the new meds help you. I do not really have anything to add except that gummies helped me sleep when my pain was at its worse. My spouse went to a dispensary and explained that I was not sleeping due to shingles and the pain. They knew instantly what to try and sent him home with a few things. The gummies worked. I ended up only needing half of one. I believe it was called indica. Knocked me out for hours. It was awesome. Ill be thinking of you.
9820,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never got it as a kid so I got the vaccine later in my 30s
9822,GenX Shingrix: The second dose was not as bad. It ask beatsn shingles.
9824,"Shingles Vaccine: One of my close friends got shingles last year (we're 35) ALL over her whole body. Giant welts, rashes and scabs everywhere. She's had 2 kids with unmedicated births and said the shingles pain was way worse than childbirth for her, and it lasted quite some time. Still has some scars from it. I'd get the vaccine."

9832,Shingles vaccine: I received my two shingles vaccine shots this year and had zero ill effects. The same is true for all but one of my COVID19 vaccinations. Wishing you luck
9833,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: Worth mentioning that while the vaccines are amazing and absolutely worth getting you can still get HPV and develop cancer. Yep I have got my appointment for the colposcopy next week after a smear test found a highrisk HPV strain and mildly abnormal cells. I was vaccinated before I ever had sex and had been putting off the pap smear. Its important to not only practice safe sex but insist your partner shows you a negative STD screening before foregoing condoms. Just FYI that as far as I know there is no reliable way to test men for HPV. So even if you only ever have sex after seeing they are all clear on testable STIs that still does not mean you know about HPV. Only way to know is getting those pap smears.
9834,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yeah 1 down. Hurt like a mofo.
9839,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: The second shot has been much easier in my experience and the experience of those I know who have done it.

9849,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Still feeling fine... arm is a tiny bit sore but it might just be psychosomatic.
9853,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Trust me it is probably worth it cuz DAMN shingles is painful. Basically felt like someone threw a javelin through my chest.
9856,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It's normal...either the first or the second shot gets you good. Your body is going through shingles boot camp, so all this discomfort is actually is good thing compared to catching the real thing."
9859,RSV shot: Do it. Mine took doses up to 1year old. She caught it last week and almost ended up in the hospital.
9860,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I second this I had shingles on my face at age 37 not in my eye luckily...GET THE VACCINE. It was horrible. 12 years later and I will occasionally feel a twinge of nerve pain where I had my outbreak.

9867,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Not just shingles though those are the worst. The herpes virus causing chicken pox can do other things like create pusfilled pustules on your fingers around the nail bed. It is called herpetic whitlow and quite painful. Often misdiagnosed as other kinds of nail bed infections or dyshidrotic eczema. I had this on one of my thumbs and not only does having it sucks but the area also remained super sensitive to pressure for two years after likely because the herpes virus hides along the nervous system a It left a scar too.

9875,First time getting singles on my forehead eyelid and scalp any tips for face wash and healing?: It sounds like mine my scalp is not an easy fix. Shingles were bad across my face but my scalp definitely made the pain worse. Try 12 oxyxodone first and then see how it affects you. It got close to my eye but did not bother the sight it was a month off work.
9876,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I personally did not experience any withdrawals from the gabapentin other than having a terrible time waking up the next morning.

9878,Shingles vaccine: My mother had shingles in 1994. She ended up with some kind of neuropathy where the shingles pain never went away. She died in 2022 and suffered every day of her life because of shingles. It was horrific watching her suffer and nobody could really help her. Get the shot
9880,Shingles vaccine: Hubby had shingles in his 30s weird I know. It was excruciating and it lasted like 3 weeks. 36 hours of flu symptoms is worth it.

9881,"Blister formation after receiving second Varicella vaccine: Female/30/Asian/5'5/140lbs I had received my first dose of the Varicella vaccine as a child, but somehow missed getting the second dose. Recently, as a thirty-year-old female, I had to get the second vaccine as a requirement for my job as a teacher. I have never had chickenpox before. After getting the vaccine, I noticed a blister-like formation on my inner thigh, near where the shot was administered. It started as a rash and then developed into a blister after I removed the bandage. It's mildly itchy and uncomfortable at times, but not severe. I am concerned because I haven't seen any information about blisters being a common reaction to the vaccine. I'm worried if this could be a sign of chickenpox or if it puts me at risk for shingles. I have consulted with multiple healthcare professionals, including pharmacists and a doctor, but no one seems to have a clear answer. I'm reaching out to Reddit for more opinions and advice on what this could be and if I should be concerned. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. ---"

9906,Shingles Vaccine: I had one before starting Ocrevus and the other one after. My GP recommended not getting them at the same time as the COVID shot because both of them tend to be hard on the body. It was about as painful as the COVID shot.
9916,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? Doesn't make sense to me......: Is this common? Do others get blood tests to test for shingles? I was under the impression it was only testable with a swab of a blister?

9926,I am hoping someone in this community might have some insight into the symptoms my mother is experiencing. Thus far no one has been able to figure out the because. I am a nurse but my expertise is in Cardiology so I can summarize recent events well but am at a loss on how to proceed from here and am not having much success with her PCP.Waiting for an outpatient neurology appointment in October. PMH 68 year old with hypertension hyperlipidemia migraines anxiety depression left hip replacement in 62024 April 2024 developed L foot drop which she attributed to hip severe osteoarthritis planned hip replacement in June truthfully she delayed the hip replacement 810 years longer than she should have and was incredible debilitated going into it May 2024 developed intermittent lisp which has very slowly worsened and now progressed to profound dysarthria. I clocked the lisp immediately but she never displayed any acute neurological symptoms that she or I are aware of. June 2024 underwent planned L hip replacement July 2024 had post op ortho appointment L foot drop had not improved or resolved so a lumbar MRI and EMG were ordered. At this point she was able to use a cane inside her home no longer required the walker Early August 2024 admitted for severe nausea hyponatremia and hypokalemia later attributed to HCTZ since discontinued electrolytes replaced nausea resolved once normalized discharged home but just these two days were a significant setback from a strength perspective. From this point forward she required a walker a cane is not enough. August 12 saw new PCP for the first time who was concerned about speech and symptoms ordered stat head MRI which was done the following day. It showed old strokes which were news to us Mild chronic microvascular ischemic change and sequela of remote infarcts nothing acute but admission was recommended on the 14thbecause my mom thought her weakness was worse and her PCP thought her speech was worse over the phone thought it best to expedite neuro workup. Up until this point she was able to climb stairs slowly and carefully her house is 2 stories and could shower in her bathroom which has a shower stall and grab bars. I Am not sure exactly when but around this time she began to report hand weakness described as inability to open a chapstick and swallowing changes which she described as discomfort on the R side of her throat. Her midAugust admission notes state intermittent numbness and tinglingweakness in bilateral hands which she reported had developed since earlier August admission. Mid August 2024 admission with Neuro workup copy and pasting pieces of neuro consult below Patient was seen by neurology who noted upper and lower motor neuron findings suspicious for a motor neuronopathy. Neurology performed extensive workup including brain MRI which was negative for acute stroke though did show prior remote infarcts. Subsequent contrast enhanced brain MRI showed no evidence of intracranial metastasis. CT angiogram head and neck were negative. Cervical spine MRI showed degenerative changes in cervical spine with osteophyte complexes at C56 and C67 which resulted in mild central stenosis and moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing but cervical cord was of normal caliber and signal. Neurology did not feel that this would explain the patient's symptoms. The patient did have recent outpatient EMG due to left foot drop. Neurology advised repeat EMG to address patient's current areas of complaints. Lots of labs sent out phosphorus RF lyme titer B12 within normal fyou acetylcholine receptor binding Ab send out to test for myasthenia gravis fyou MUSK Ab send out fyou Lambert Eaton Ab panel send out fyou paraneoplastic Ab panel send out fyou spep upep send out fyou ANA send out Only abnormal results ANA Screen IFA Positive ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Mitotic spindle fibers ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Cytoplasmic fine speckled Ultimately thought to be motor neuronopathy My mom is a terrible historian and easily hysterical and dramatic at baseline so its difficult for me to sort out reality from drama with her. Its hard to say if her symptoms change from one day to the next and how quickly they are progressing because she cannot really give a straight answer. I will say that since her last admission and rehab stay she can no longer manage stairs of any kind and is living on one floor of her home. She cannot stand long enough to shower. Vaccines most recently in the fall 2023 covid flu shingles spaced out per pharmacist Including this because she is questioning vaccine injury but her symptoms did not seem to start until six months later She lives alone since my dad passed away in 2020 and is not doing well keeping up with maintaining her house which I did not truly appreciate until the last few months. Just last weekend I noticed significant mold in her basement but I do not know when it appeared. It was light gray not black from what I could see. I have not seen mold in the rest of the house but that does not mean its not there. She lives in an area with high iron content in water has a full house filtration system. She does not drink or cook with that water but has bathed in it and done laundry in it since 2000. I do not think it has been tested for any abnormalities. I Am wondering if she has an autoimmune disorder causing neurological symptoms if this is strictly neurological or something else I Am not aware of. I Am happy to provide any other info I can get my hands on if there is something I should have included. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
9927,BATTLE OF THE QUILTING SUBSCRIPTION BOXES Sew Sampler April 2024: Hi Holly The box is a 10 in my opinion. Those zippers are a great idea I would love to see how well they work. Also the journal is awesome and I collect the needle minders. They are very handy especially for hand work. As far as the shots go..get them. To say anything is 100 is well not logical to me. I am a nurse as well so I recommend if you are not feeling well do not go around River otherwise I would not worry about it. She is somewhat protected by mom as well. The shingles shots of which there are 2 of them each 45 months apart. This is probably the most painful I have had at the injection site beginning the next day for the next several days . Most vaccines these days are not live viruses. I do not know of any that are but I certainly do not know everything either. If you have any concerns just check with your primary Dr or ask the pharmacist. Good luck
9928,First shingles shot is a bitch. I normally do not react to any innoculations but that one sucks.
9933,"COVID vaccine and Shingles: To start off, I want to say this should absolutely NOT be something that should scare anyone from getting the COVID vaccine nor should it be taken as a definitive association. I've recently been diagnosed with Shingles, just a week after my 2nd COVID shot. Interestingly, I'm also in a serology study that showed I had 1 of 3 antibodies (iGa) for COVID prior to the vaccine, although I was never diagnosed, nor have I ever tested positive for COVID. Anyone with a similar experience after getting the COVID shot?"
9937,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: OMGG. My mom who is 65 just has shingles and was one of the worst pains of her life. I felt awful. Sprayed her with lidocaine etc. I am 30 and def had the chicken pox meet and greet with others as a kid after we got it.
9939,Shingles Sucks: Better off with the vaccine than getting shingles. It did a number on my MIL and I vaguely know that five years later she still has issues. It is not a fun shot and stings a bit but certainly manageable.
9942,Shingles vaccine: After getting sick from the flu shot and an extremely painful arm from the 2nd Covid shot I was not looking forward to the shingles shots. I Am happy to say I had no pain at the injection site and no side effects whatsoever. I got the shots from CVS spaced 6 months apart.
9943,Day after 2nd shingles dose no problems age 50 bodyweight 165: Wow..I had chicken pox but I heard nightmares about shingles and could not wait to get the vaccine. I thought it would leave me sore but no side effects at all
9951,First time shingles: I would like to emphasize that I am also experiencing postherpetic neuralgia PHN pain. While I had shingles in May 2024 the rash although painful was incomparable to the debilitating pain of PHN. Currently I am managing my condition with a combination of medications including Lyrica Cymbalta antiinflammatories and Tramadol. It is important to note that individual responses to medication may vary and what may seem like a significant amount of medicine to some may be necessary for effective pain management. The medicine helps a little bit like 3 out 10. To Be Honest most days I have to stand or lay on my stomach. To sit is extremely painful. My heart goes out to you and everyone that gets Phn pain.
9954,Family member started experiencing symptoms few days ago. Painful blister like bumps on one side of the head and neck. Burning sensation around the ear and bumps. Had fever and sweating at night as well. Admitted to ER today but doctor is not sure about the diagnosis. She is already vaccinated against shingles etc. Blood work came out normal. No prior history of such rash. She did have mild scalp psoriasis. Is this just a severe flare up or something else?
9955,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Getting my 2nd dose this week. My inlaws both had it they like your wife are vaccinehesitant and it ruined both their lives in terms of paindiscomfort for literally months. If they had not already been retired it would have made it impossible to work. Someone else I know ended up with what may be permanent facial paralysis from their bout with shingles they were in their mid40s when they got it so did not qualify for the vaccine. Needless to say I was signed up within months of turning 50.
9956,Shingles vaccine: Hahaha I went and gave blood after one of my covid boosters. Then had a drink with dinner. I was a very cheap drunk that night
9957,33 year old female. I have been immunocompromised since childhood and am looking for anyone who can help diagnose me. Viruses When I got the chicken pox Varicella Zoster Virus it made me VERY sick. My siblings got it at the same time and only had a few spots. My mom said I had thousands and had to see a doctor. My dad got chicken pox twice the second time as an adult and almost died. When I was 11 I got shingles on my back. I got diagnosed with severe warts Human Papilloma Virus on my hands and feet when I was 12 numerous on every finger have not been able to get rid of them for over 20 years. I was vaccinated against Hepatitis B as scheduled but when my antibody titres came back it said my body did not respond to the vaccine and I would need to be vaccinated again. I had Rubella German Measles Virus despite being vaccinated against it. I always get the COVID and flu vaccines but still get them both whenever they circulate. I have had confirmed cases of Norovirus Norwalk on several occasions as well as numerous gastrointestinal viruses. ParasiticFungalBacterial Infections I have had a confirmed case of Ascaris Lumbroides a parasitic infection traveling to SE Asia. No other person in my group was infected as far as I know. Developed Clostridium Difficile after antibiotics in my 20s. Numerous cases of athletes foot and a bacterial infection called pitted keratolysis to my feet. Developed impetigo on two occasions as an adult. I have clubbing on several of my fingers. I come from a middle class family have great hygiene and I work in a medical field. Please someone help me
9959,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Talk it over with whoever is giving you the vaccine. I always have issues with vaccines but I did not with that. I made sure I could not look and kept my arm still and relaxed. I took it easy for a few days after and I was fine.
9960,First time shingles and scared: i know right? it has been a few days since the rash appeared but i figure i should take the tablets anyway and see if they help at all. today is the worst so far for pain but ill live i am sure and thank you
9961,Put me out of my misery.: FYI after getting the shot a tiny percentage of people myself included can have a Guillain Barre type of autoimmune response. This can lead to unexplained numbness and nerve pains in the feet which can quickly move up your legs. Scary as shit but Id rather have that than shingles.
9962,I just got my lab work back on my patient portal. It shows my eosinophils auto absolute 103uL are high at 0.8 and my red blood cells 106uL are high at 5.73. Is this something I should be concerned about? Could it be explained by dehydration or the 4 vaccines COVID Pneumonia Shingles Flu that I received last week? Age 20 Height 63 Weight 205 lbs. Smoker No Alcohol consumption None Drug use None Medications Ritalin LA 20 mg Gabapentin 2400 mg Cymbalta 60 mg Risperdal 2 mg Seroquel 200 mg Metformin 1000 mg.
9963,jjfgreen First I have been able to get back to bench after a dose of shingles which left me with neuralgia final sub assemblies off sprue. Hoping when finished the engine coil angle will not be too noticeable. If your over 60 get the shingles vaccine on the NHS do not risk ending up
9965,Shingles vaccine: I did not react at all to either dose but then as a dialysis patient I am severely immunocompromised. Vaccines do not work on me like they do on others.
9966,"At 1 minute 39 seconds into the trailer, we see a shot of Emond's Field and you can see that the roofs of all the houses are shingled not thatched. No thatch means no thatcher and I don't think I can really watch the show if they leave out one of the most important characters Cenn Buie: I'm fine with the showrunners making small changes like Egwene being the dragon but this is going too far! What are they planning on doing when they get to the prologue for book 6 and the plot line around Faile mediating between the thatcher and Master Hornvall, the Tarboner tile maker?"
9967,Shingles shot: Can you tell me more about this condition please? I had shingles at the beginning of 2023 and the breakout only resulted in a few clusters of the larger bumps that itched but all over I had small bumps which at first I thought was the source pain I was also experiencing. However after the skin cleared the pain was still intense for nearly 2 additional weeks before dulling. But every once in a while right now being one of those times I have a flare up of the same type of pain and a serious fatigue. It feels like my skin is on fire and everything makes it worse from the breeze some makes walking past you to water regardless of the temperature and any clothing is torture regardless. I have asked my GP but I have not gotten any explanation. So any insight would be greatly appreciated
9968,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: My doctors office just received the vaccine last week. I am so grateful they called me. My niece was hospitalized with RSV that turned into pneumonia about six weeks ago and she is still on two inhalers.
9969,Its called shingles. Its a side affect from the Pfizer vaccine. Do your own research instead of spreading dumb mpox bs. Weird Another global pandemic during an election year.. wake the F up people. Stop being the sheep they want you to be
9970,Hit me hard for about a day on both doses. But it is so much better than shingles. Have a friend with a horror story...still unable to work after a year. Please do not let the vaccine stories keep you from it.
9974,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Yay I get my second shingrix next month. I currently have RSV along with my grandson and daughter and let me tell you it sucks. You have to be 60 to get the RSV vaccine. So any elder Xers hurting 60 this year get the RSV vaccine if you can
9975,First Time With Shingles. Was Not Bad But Would Not Want Again. How Well Did the Vaccine Work For You?: I have had shingles three times . Apparently it is due to low immune system I have crohns . The last lot of shingles was mild I had got my first shingles shot December 27th 2023 I got shingle March 8th 2024 but mild . I am thinking that the shot may have saved me from getting the shingles worse.
9978,Shingles vaccine: I also have an autoimmune disease and was not told to get the shingles vaccine so I contracted shingles last year. Honestly it was not as painful as when my autoimmune disease first developed before I started medications for it. The shingles developed on my left leg and it was kind of painful to walk for a couple of weeks but was much better after that.
9984,GenX Shingrix: My spouse did Rona and Shingrix together. Do not recommend.
9985,"pseudo flare?: Hello everyone! I've been in the process of starting ocrevus, and to do so I was told to get the shingles vaccine. I had my first dose last Thursday and by Saturday i started to get numbness in parts of both my feet that's continuing still. I'm wondering if this is a pseudo flare from the vaccine?? I don't have the numbness as a previous symptom. My first and only relapse so far is a mild case of optic neuritis. Any input would help ?? thanks!"
9994,Is keeping the cervix really a big cancer risk if you have received the Gardasil vaccine are HPV negative and have never had an abnormal pap smear?: Fuck having a cervix. I got HPV a while back even though I was vaccinated with gardasil at 15y. Do not expect the vaccine to make HPV go away in the general population. The common flu strains still go around every winter even though most people have been getting a flu vaccine every year for decades. I do not see any good reason to keep a potential locus of infection and breeding ground for cancer. Is it a big risk of getting cervical cancer? I do not know and it also depends on what your risk tolerance is when you say big. But it is 0 if you do not have a cervix and it is not like keeping it gives you any real benefits.
9996,Hi everyone I Am a 21M just looking for recommendations on what to do anymore. Honestly I do not know what to do its just getting worse and worse and I feel lost. It originally started with one and once one goes away another pops up or two more and its just been neverending. It has started to spread to my middle finger on the other hand its really hard to tell in the photos but there is one. Then it began to move down to my foot and there is one down there now on the same side as the infected hand. I Am just so lost and its destroying me physically and mentally. I Am worried to touch my girlfriend because I Am scared I Am going to give her these. I received the HPV vaccine when I was younger because I thought I did not have it and was going to try that but I had it already. I Have been getting them frozen for the last year and a half I had a couple of months off from February to April due to getting really sick and having surgery. I Have had them sprayed and used the imiquimod they prescribed on top of using wart stick with salicylic acid. I also just started taking some zinc supplements recently. I just feel like everything I do accomplishes nothing and I Am stuck.
10000,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Got it when it ripped through all the kids at my babysitters and then got shingles recently as a result of a my immune system being thrashed while recovering from Lyme.
10004,Rash appeared overnight: I had shingles 10 years ago in college but it was painful. This is not painful. Would Not shingles have pain associated with it?
10007,PANDEMIC ALERT IN AMERICA: Yeah I got the Norovirus 2 months ago and oh my God it sucked bad I do not wish that on anybody
10009,I had the vaccine about 5 years ago. Like other's felt crappy for about 36 hours then fine. Saw the pain my daughter had with the Shingles two times...I do not want that
10015,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I have never had a covid or Flu shot. I had a very mild case of covid in Jan 2021 just headache and fever for 24hrs. I had the flu twice in 15 or so years. My husband being military had to have flu shot ever year and covid vaccine in the beginning. He got the flu almost every year and had covid 4 times
10017,Shingles and other Vaccines: I get symptoms from those shots too. Totally worth getting them though. I do not get symptoms from other shots like the flu shot or tetanus.
10021,Tell me about your vaccine flares: If I was not in a flare besides the expected side effects of getting vaccinated everything was the same. If I was in a flare at the time of the vaccination it becomes a 2 for 1 brawl over which is going to affect me the most.
10023,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: A friend had shingles a year back is usually the stoic type but said he was kept up crying from the pain
10024,I have a close friend who got the vaccine but blew off the boosters. He caught COVID twice in June. Said it really sucked. Is still coughing. Yesterday he got the Shingles shot. Lessons learned no more blowing off stuff. I have not got the Shingles shot yet.
10025,The vaccine kicked my butt flat for a couple of days. I would far rather that than shingles. One of my clients was blinded in one eye when shingles attacked her optical nerve.
10028,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: It should not hurt that much. Every so often an injection hits a sore spot though
10035,"Anyone else getting nauseous and/or abdominal gut pains?: I went to the ER on Christmas Day (fun times) because my left side from ribs, back and just to the left of the belly button have been causing me issues. Anywhere from mild annoying to dull/aching pains, bloating, upset stomach, cramps, nausea, the works. I got cat scans done and did blood work and everything turned up as looking okay from spleen to guts to stomach, nothing out of the ordinary or cause for concern. And sent me home with a GI referral. For some history/context: I have noticed that ever since covid and then having mono stacked with shingles that I've had what you could call ""random vibrations"" or twitches in my body, from the side of my head to my left side (where I had shingles) to my groin. Now I did change to an all vegetarian diet about six weeks ago and to a low histamine diet to see if they helped curb other symptoms like hot hands and neuropathy. So I'm trying to figure out if gut health and digestion can also be a side effect of LC or if it's triggered by my diet or perhaps both. Thanks."
10037,RSV vaccine: I had the vaccine and as far as I am aware my baby boy is okay I am nearly 39 weeks it is better to get this vaccine than risk your child getting rsv when they are born in rsv season because rsv is deadly to babies I understand the concern and uncertainty of a new vaccine and also wishing to do the your best for your kid but the best you can do is to get yourself vaccinated against this nasty virus as it passes on the antibodies in the womb to the baby I also had tdap too about 16 weeks pregnant.
10044,Recurring shingles advice: I was coming here to find the same info. I f68 had a terrible bout of shingles a year ago August. All along my left arm the day after diagnosis my arm stopped working I could not lift it at all. It was three months before I could lift it again. I also had a lot of pain in my neck apparently from where the nerves from my arm enter. It was about eight months until the random painitch on my arm went away. The last few days I have been itchy down the same biome area of arm relating to the c5 and c6 vertebrae that was affected last year. I feel very tiny bumps along the same path. I have felt it before and thought I was imagining it but they go away without getting bigger. Is this a recurrence? I am not having any other symptoms
10045,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It beat me up but the 2nd one was way easier and the whole experience is way better than the shingles ask my older family members who have had shingles...
10047,Just had results back from my first HPV test and I came back positive for HPV 58. I had the vaccine around 2 years ago and I believe type 58 is covered in this vaccine so not sure how I have managed to get it Just really paranoid that I have had this infection prior to the vaccine and if this hpv has been in my body over 2 years will that mean I have a high risk of cervical cancer? As everywhere I have googled online has said the infection should clear within a year and becomes a high risk if not cleared. Is it possible that I got the hpv infection within the last year and the vaccine did not protect against it? I Am currently away from home and I will not be back until nye so I will not be able to book a smear test until then just trying to get reassurance from anyone as i feel quite upset and I Am really worried
10049,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: chicken pox age 3 before vaccine came out then had vaccine then got shingles age 10..
10052,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had to get the chicken pox vaccine as an adult after I gave birth because I never got it as a kid Had no idea too until I was tested at 7 months pregnant.
10053,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My buddy was medically retired from the Navy because of this. 38 Pilot developed shingles on his torso while we were deployed on the Roosevelt. Treated like a rash for about a week before the ships medical threw in the towel and he was flown off to Okinawa. I do not know if you know about the environment onboard a carrier but it is not super conducive to comfort. Dude was in constant agony for a week with no real recourse. Saw him months later nerve damage and scarring 100 disability. Navy spent multiple millions of dollars training him only to be brought down by chicken pox.
10054,"My Story - 38f: Hi all, Sharing my story and hope it benefits those scouring Doctor Google looking for some guidance. I also likely aggravated the situation further, which I will describe below. Also, I make reference to the timing with vaccinations as an aside. I am in no way, shape, or form anti-vaccination. I think they're great and even if this incident is related, these would fall into the ""rare but serious side effects"" category. My case started two weeks ago. I had the flu and updated coronavirus vaccine booster the weekend before symptoms started (9/23 and 9/24 respectively). That Monday (9/25), I became lightheaded and began to have tightness in my chest. Both my blood pressure and blood oxygen were fine, so I assumed it was just some post-vaccine ick and moved on. As the day progressed, I started having sharp pains down the front of my left thigh and my heart rate was elevated. I became nervous that I might have a blood clot. I called into my GP on Tuesday. The nurse suggested I use OTC pain medication to manage the leg pain and to call back if symptoms worsened or progressed. By Thursday (9/28) the pain was excruciating and presented as throbbing, stabbing, and aching. I went to the ER and had a battery of tests to rule out a heart issue or blood clot: chest x-ray, leg ultrasound, EKG, D-Dimer test, heart ultrasound, and CTscan. All negative/clear, except an elevated d-dimer test. The doctor discharged me, noting that an elevated D-Dimer can be indicative of a number of things, including an infection. She suggested I go home, take pain killers, and follow up with my GP. When I got home from the hospital that night, I noticed a rash on my lower back/upper buttock area. My partner suggested we had been sitting all day in the ER and perhaps the rash was from the chairs. I was dubious, but I also have very sensitive skin so shrugged it off. At the time, I didn't have pain in the area so I assumed it was unrelated. I decided to treat the pain as muscular, which is when I made one of the worst mistakes. We own a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit which, if you're unfamiliar, delivers an electrical shock through the skin to overstimulate the nerves and ""shut down"
10055,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it at 16. Besides labor and delivery and maybe Covid I cannot think of any other time I was so miserable. And it was bad. In my throat bad
10058,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My twin sons were born 26 weeks 2 days too We said yes to any and all vaccines in the NICU and still do they just turned 2. I was really upset when we did not qualify for the RSV vaccine this year. We did Synagis last winter. My twins have had a few colds from daycare but no Covid or RSV so far and I am so glad we have done everything we can do to hopefully prevent them from getting a dangerous respiratory infection. they are doing amazingly in every way other than the fact that both still use their inhaler to help with their BPD.
10060,Shingles vaccine: I was sore that is all. Advil took care of it.
10065,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Same. I was working. Stomach pain. I was uninsured and dumb so I tried to tough it out. Had the next two days off so I thought I would deal with maybe a stomach bug. Two days later I could barely walk. Called my girlfriend and she took me to the er. They said I should get surgery but could try the antibiotics first since I had no insurance. The surgeon came in at 3am and said I needed the surgery or I was going to die of sepsis. So I woke up with staples in my stomach and the bag. 10 days in the hospital and 200K of debt. 5 months on disability. My saving grace was Red Dead 2 dropped one month into my recovery. I got the reversal 5 years ago on Valentines Day. My now fianc was amazing through the process and that was when I realized how much she cared about me. I look like I took a sword and a dagger to the gut. But I am alive and bag free. A lot happened between then and now and I feel like that experience gave me perspective. I quit my job and went to work somewhere with health insurance. Definitely changed me a bit. Not as young and dumb. Biggest takeaway. If you do not have health insurance and you are fucked up. GO TO THE HOSPITAL ANYWAY. It would have cost me 10K in antibiotics pain meds and an overnight hospital stay if I went in a day or two earlier instead it ruptured and I was dying and it turned into 5 months of a colostomy bag and 200k of debt AND a second surgery another hospital stay of 11 days and more recovery. My disability ran out a month early so I had to go back to work prematurely. America amiright? Still feel like I am lucky though. Perspective.
10068,Why NY39 Militarized Dystopia Is A Threat To Our Freedom Naomi Wolf Dr. Meryl Nass Ask Dr. Drew: There is a such thing as long shedding after giving my 2 pfizer jabbed neighbors a ride with the windows almost all the way up over 2 years and 8 months I still have massive stabbing headachesvision issuesnumbness in my fingers while sleeping and when waking up
10070,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: RSV can be asymptomatic in healthy adults. My 26 weeker received it around 34 weeks. Zero issues. It would be worse for her to return to the ICU for RSV. Provided peace of mind for my husband and I to run to the store.
10073,Got the vaccine 1st shot and had actual shingles outbreak a couple weeks after.
10075,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I just got it yesterday at 34 weeks and have had zero side effects not even a sore arm and my glucose numbers have been completely normal.
10077,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Not at all. Arm is not even sore right now. Pharmacist said the older vaccines had a reaction but now it is not too bad.
10081,Holidays  Vaccination Schedules: I totally understand where you are coming from. The holidays can be nerve wracking especially when you have a little one. I do not think its wrong to voice your concerns  setting boundaries if need be. Make sure everyone washes their hands no kissing the baby you can even ask people to wear a mask if it makes you more comfortable. My LO was able to get the RSV shot the day after he was born maybe look into that as well?
10085,I officially have my diagnosis of RA as well as fibromyalgia as of yesterday. I am starting on methotrexate so my doc wanted me to get the shingles and pneumonia vaccines. I am wondering if anyone has any tricks to help with the side effects of those? My arm feels like it was hit with a baseball it is so sore I can hardly move it. I have tried ice but that has not helped. Do I just have to wait it out? How long did the side effects last for you? Thanks.
10086,Shingles vaccine experience: Have you ever had Shingles? The vaccine is nothing compared to the pain of having Shingles. It was excruciating It was across my breastbone. Could not wear a bra for over a week. Could barely wear a shirt at times.
10089,Shingles vaccine: Has 2 shots. No biggie. Beats the alternative. My wife had a horrible time with shingles.
10094,I posted last week that I pulled a nerve in my back and I couldn t figure out how. As it happens it wasn t a nerve at all it was shingles. Can t say I saw that coming. I had back pain I thought was a pinched nerve. That went on for a few days. A day after I posted about that I thought I was bit by a wasp as I had two bites on my hip. It developed into a rash that started creeping across my skin. I couldn t touch it without pain so I went to urgent care she took one look and boom I have shingles. Thankfully I got there in time to get meds for it. I m 52. I definitely thought I was too young but the doc said menopause and other things like stress can lower your immune response to the chicken pox virus and it can be reactivated. I ve been stressed out of my mind for years so I should have got the vaccine I ve never been in this much pain outside of childbirth. The rash is going away but now my joints ache from my hip to my groin and down my leg. It s so weird. When I have pain killers in me it s tolerable when they wear off I start to cry. Long story short if meno is making you feel run down consider talking to your doc about preventing shingles too. I wouldn t wish this on anyone.
10096,Shingles and other Vaccines: You are not just being a baby. That Is an important thing for you to realize. When you are feeling sick I do not want you to feel guilty about it too. That would just make you feel worse and feeling sick from a vaccine is not a weakness or a fault. Its how your body reacts. Vaccines affect different people in different ways. Its still better than getting shingles or Covid. Luckily all I get is a sore arm. But for those of you who get really sick from some vaccines talk to your doctor about how to alleviate the symptoms.
10099,Shingles vaccine: The first dose kicked my ass way worse than any of the covid vaccines. And now I am too chicken shit to get the second dose. But I have heard horror stories about shingles so I will probably man up at some point and get dose number 2.
10100,"1st chickenpox infection - vaccine a good idea after recovery?: So last year, I got my 4th Covid vaccine and tetanus shot, since I had been recovering from a bad case of pneumonia. I also had chickenpox in August 2022, so I inquired about the chickenpox vaccine. Because I'm 30, it had to be approved...and I did receive permission to get it but the double vaccinations made me extremely ill, plus I had some food poisoning (I have a sensitive stomach). I decided to postpone and let everything settle down, but had a huge argument with my sibling the week after. Last Monday, I noticed some red spots appearing. Itchy sensations are common for me due to allergies, as well as just feeling off and fatigued in the weeks leading up to my menstrual cycle. I felt even more unwell on Tuesday but had been working out, so I brushed it off. By Wednesday morning, I felt significantly worse. The red spots had multiplied and were spreading on my chest and back. I visited my doctor who confirmed it was chickenpox and prescribed antiviral medication. I'm feeling extremely tired with itching/burning sensations all over my body. The rash is more widespread compared to last year but not as severe as some cases I've seen online. Now I'm regretting not getting the chickenpox vaccine! But I heard it can also be tough on the body. Should I consider getting it once I've recovered, even if it might make me sick again? I'll be missing out on Thanksgiving gatherings this weekend and possibly work next week. I tried to run a few errands today, but my energy levels are too low. ---"
10101,FAT QUARTER Bundle from Modern Quilter EBONY SUITE: The fabric is beautiful I also got the pneumonia and shingles 1 together. It was a rough 24 hours. For shingles 2 I was mentally prepared to lay low for a day. I had a family member suffer with shingles so I am glad it is done and behind me.
10103,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: i got shingles. on. my. face. it was some of the worst pain i have experienced.. and i have given birth. id gladly experience some fatigue over that. hopefully the vaccine is effective.
10106,Shingles vaccine experience: Both of my shots were nothingburgers pain wise. Bit of soreness and then nothing. Glad to have that taken care of at my advanced age
10110,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I am sure they would give it to you if you self pay but with my posts about my experience it may not be all it is cracked up to be. Of course I will never know because I do not know if I will ever get shingles or if it prevented shingles but I had a hellacious experience with the shot. I got very sick and one in five people do get very sick from the side effects. Just something to think about.
10111,Shingles vaccine experience: 2nd shot was a lot better for me
10113,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: My wife just got it a month ago and I had it when I was 27. it is awful. Felt like getting shocked on my ribs randomly.
10114,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am sorry. I was vaccinated for chickenpox. Every kid on my block got chickenpox except me
10118,Our family knows quite a few people who got shingles after the vaccine in BECAUSE Canada.
10119,First 24 hours after dose: Same here Injection into arm By hour 4 its full effect then by day 4 its weakens and symptoms lessen.
10124,PHN or MS?: Have MS and shingles left me the gift of PHN on my lower left back. The coming and going needs to be evaluated for MS. As the poster above said a MRI could give a peek to see what may be happening neurologically. Internal shingles is also an option. People who have had shingles were floored that I could not feel shingles coming the five times I was blessed with it. I cannot tell the difference between it and a bad MS day until the stupid rash shows up. I also take medication to help with nerve painmuscle spasms because MS. I had read a study saying that shingles may activate MS. It seemed less likely that shingles would activate it than EBV they are pretty sure sparks it and maybe EBV reactivation is the reason for relapses. Like 95 of us get EBV and no vaccine exists yet. The science is hard to trace but every day they get closer. Any time the immune system is poked it could always poke back way harder and do dumb things like eat your brains. Hopefully it is just shingles acting up or a left over after party. We do not want additional members in the MS group. No offense
10126,Me 19F and my boyfriend 20M recently found out that his sister has HPV and we are both freaking out as we obviously often stayed in the same house as her and used the same bathroom shower etc. The last time me and my boyfriend slept together was 3 months ago but about a month ago I noticed a small but slightly painful bump in my private area. I assumed it was a razor bumpingrown hair as it appeared just after I shaved and it went away in a couple of days but since we got these news I have been super worried even if it might seem silly. I usually get irritated or get razor bumps after shaving there but that was the first and only time I had something so close to the actual entrance of the organ. On the other hand I have looked up what GW look like and it was nothing like that. I got vaccinated for HPV at 17 and my current boyfriend is the first and only sexual partner I have had. We also have always used protection. Is it possible for us to catch HPV from his sister because we shared the same bathroom or something like that? Am I overthinking it by thinking the razor bump could mean anything?
10128,"Long Term Side Effects from Shingrix vaccination. Chronic ear pain, dizzyness, vertigo.: Had my first set of shingles shingrix vaccines in 2020. Again another dose in 6/2023. First two doses OK. Have been sick for 3 months after the most resent one with on and off flu like symptoms Side effects have slowed accept for the chronic ear pain, dizzyness, vertigo, and headaches. Working with PCP and ENT's to get resolved. Seems like all problems are with inner ear. Pain in left ear started 2 days after shot. Side effects keep cycling but do not end. Dr's. are saying they are not sure what is causing this. Doing MRI's and CT scans, have not found anything so far. Anyone else having similar symptoms or any ideas as to what my be the source. Never had shingles or any type of ear problem or infection. Thanks"
10130,Shingrix for 50yr olds: I got shingles on my forehead for the first time in January at 46 years old. It was horrible. I asked my Doctor about the vaccine and she said to just wait until I Am 50 because insurance companies usually will not pay for it if you are younger than 50.
10131,I was diagnosed with RRMS last month and my life has turned upside down. Finished 3 days of steroid infusions and now working through my vaccines before I can start kesimpta later this month. Currently feeling like shit from tetanus and covid vaccines and Monday need to get shingles and pneumonia vaccines. Am I a horrible person since I want everyone I know to be miserable? It just seems like their still living their best life. Enjoying summer and 4th of July while I am miserable. It makes me angry and resentful that everyone else is happy and enjoying life while I am so miserable about everything. I do not want to see or talk to anyone and if they do reach out all I want to do is talk about how miserable I am and how my life has completely changed. It feels like people do not care when I know they do but it is not fair that they get to continue living like everything is normal and I am stuck in an upside down world of doom.
10132,Long covid shingles I Am just so done with this: Well I Am sorry this happened to you. Considering these are good things for you the minimal size not so severe pain. Maybe your Dr can write an Rx for antivirals you can hold onto it until you need to submit if it starts to come back again? Or you may end up in an isolation room in an er at 2am because you were told get them before 72 hrs and the hospital prescribed them. They Are pretty common antivirals. I felt ridiculous sitting on the exam table with a thumbprint size blister area and being in isolation. I hope the reducing trend continues. I had the nerve pain and sensitive skin down my arm for a couple of days beforehand and by the time the patch was there it was only the size of my thumb print. I thought it may be where I touched myself just under my tshirt sleeve because I was working with acids earlier in the day or the prior day. But upon reading and seeing examples online I had a pretty strong hunch. Also just be aware you are contagious and it can be dangerous for pregnant women and never infected or non vaccinated people to be around any open blisters which I think its on your back so nobody will accidentally go skin to skin.
10138,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: I got four last year only three this year. I have figured out that the shingles vaccine is my kryptonite. That alone takes me out for at least a week. So if I am getting shingles I piggyback every vaccine I can into that visit. The following week is shot either way.
10139,Shingles with PHN after: I totally believe you. The pain of shingles is unreal and painnmeds barely make a dent. Also for some reason the pain is often worse at night. After 6 weeks of pain I finally had Botox injections into the affected areas and it immediately reduced the pain so that I could get off of pain meds. Then the remaining discomfort gradually faded away. I also got the vaccination. Even some naturopaths recommend it
10140,Shingles vaccine experience: I got my shingles vaccine about three years ago. The pain was brief for both shots. Rather go through a little pain in my arms. My father in law had shingles and was miserable for months.
10141,PSA Vaccinated? Yes you CAN still get shingles: I also had the vaccine and got it. Fairly mild to what I have read here. I have been relaxed and stress free for months now so stress does not track with me. I do wonder if it is post C covid related. I had it about 6 months ago. Sucks.
10142,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: You're not being dramatic at all. My Dad is on of those guys who suffers in silence. He got shingles and said it was some of the worst pain he'd ever felt."
10145,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: my WIC office was offering free RSV vaccines for babies under 11 pounds my daughter got hers with no wait. poor baby did not like the poke of course but i was there to kiss her. such a little trooper.
10147,"Is the Shingles vaccine helpful?: The vaccine can help reduce the chances of getting shingles again. Research shows that the vaccine is effective at preventing shingles and its complications, like postherpetic neuralgia, which is a painful condition that can occur after the shingles rash has healed. It's worth chatting with your healthcare provider to figure out the best timing for the vaccine after a shingles episode to ensure you're protecting yourself as much as possible."
10148,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles in my late 20s. It was horrible. Even the air hurt my poor skin. But most insurance will not cover the vaccine until you are 50. The icing on the cake is that even if you have had shingles once there is a chance you may get it again. I am pushing for my doctors to tell insurance I need the vaccine as I am immunocompromised. it is not right that we have to jump through hoops to get this vaccine when there are more and more cases of younger people getting shingles and suffering. My friend lost some vision in one eye because of the spread of the rash. Could you imagine going through that at 25 being told you will likely get shingles again and insurance saying nope not old enough.
10149,I got flu and pneumonia this week I will get covid next week and in 3 weeks I qualify for a free shingles vaccination. I am going to be impenetrable
10151,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles in my late 20s. I am 99 sure it was from a ton of stress. Very painful and annoying.
10153,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: You have my deepest sympathies. There are few people on earth that I would wish shingles on. I had shingles in May and it knocked me out for 6 weeks with lingering random nerveskin pain for a couple of weeks after that. My doc told me I was clear to train as normal but I could not make myself get out the door. If your doc gave you the clearance to train as normal and if you feel that you can make it out there is not any real reason not to. But I can remember that pain well and all I wanted was to curl into a ball. Wish you all the luck.
10155,Shingles: I Am glad it was not too bad for you So far I have some pain but Id say its manageable at the moment. Hopefully mine clears up quickly as well
10159,Shingles vaccine: Was pretty bad. Was infinitely better than getting shingles.
10160,What triggered your ankylosing spondylitis?: Shingles Had shingles for the 3rd time in 2018 which triggered both ulcerative proctitis and AS.
10162,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles at 48 before I could get the vaccine. As soon as I could I did get the vaccine. Shingles is brutal. I have never been so sick and miserable in my life. The vaccine also came with side effects and was rough but a lot better than shingles. I hope I will not get shingles again.
10164,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Same here it was pretty crazy how for 24 hrs I felt like absolute crap then like immediately I was ok.
10165,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had shingles on my head and face also had the crazy painful shocks on the top of my head. So bad I was physically trying to shrink away from my own scalp. The only thing that helped was Advil 24hr  600mg extended release
10166,Vaccine preps? USA specific: I had the shingles series last year. I keep that on my list for every 4 years. I had the shingles once and it was torture.
10167,Would baby be more protected if I get the RSV vaccine 32 weeks pregnant or if she gets the monoclonal antibody injection during the next RSV season?: Get the vaccine. I am 2 weeks postpartum. Baby was spontaneous at 37w. My whole family is sick with RSV. Eldest child the first person sick has pneumonia right now. Middle child has bronchitis. Both are on heavy antibiotics and have missed a week of school. Baby and I have zero symptoms. I am SO thankful for getting this vaccine. My newborn would have ended up in the hospital or worse without it.
10168,I felt a prick more than once this morning I had my 2nd shingles jab and she collared me to do my diabetic bloods I asked about a covid booster and the only the information the GP surgery knows about it is that it will not be done by them
10170,31 yr old male: I got my first one 2 weeks after the Covid vaccine
10172,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Yes that sounds about right and Ill take all the protection we can get. Especially for people like me who are very susceptible to bad lung infections getting RSV could be very dangerous for me and baby in the third trimester. I got it before I was pregnant and was super sick for like 6 weeks had to be in breathing treatments steroids antibiotics etc. not getting enough O2 is a BIG issue in pregnancy needless to say and being third trimester puts more strain on the lungs already My other kiddo is in daycare and its high season for RSV right now. He was hospitalized with it as a baby. I Am happy to get my baby through her most vulnerable months and us both through this last trimester. RSV is just gnarly. We just got flu this week I Am vaccinated but it does not cover all strains I Am grateful for Tamiflu as its prevented me from getting anything more than mild symptoms but to my knowledge there is no antiviral treatment for RSV. I Am very happy to have gotten the RSV shotAnd flu and Covid. I Am just very susceptible to lung infections and I do not want to get sick during this last trimester
10173,A rare case: I got shingles out of nowhere a couple of years ago. I Have no underlying health issues not on meds was not under any increased stress. But Id had a Covid vaccine 4 weeks prior. I Am not the first to say there has definitely been a link between both and although not officially recognised.. its well documented. Cannot understand why your Doc said it was too late for Anti Virals?
10174,"Is it normal to get blood work and vaccines before TTC??: So long story but in June of this year I went to an appt with an obgyn doctor to ask some questions before trying to conceive. She did not order any blood work or ask any questions about vaccines. Come yesterday I was exposed to a patient with shingles (I work in a hospital and come in contact with a bunch of people a day). The lady did not have the rash covered and I was not warned about this. As shitty as it is that is how healthcare is and I will most likely be exposed again and to other things as well. Anyways I never had chickenpox but got the varicella vaccine when I was like 2, so about 26 years ago. I'm wondering if I should've gotten a titer to see if I'm still immune. Luckily I don't think I'm pregnant because my period is due in a few days and I was negative. But it makes me wonder if I was supposed to see what tests I'm supposed to get preconception. It sucks because if I'm not immune to varicella I will have to get vaccinated again and will have to wait a few months to try. I wish my doctor would've checked the first time around. Thanks for any help!"
10178,I think I got my vaccine I hope so. Shingles is some bs
10179,ON got my RSV vaccine: I had maybe 60 seconds of vertigo the night after mine. I Do Not Know if it was related.
10181,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles last month on my forehead and it went into my left eyelid. I still have to follow up with Ophthalmology next week for yet another monitoring exam because you can go blind if the Shingles spreads into your eye. I am so angry we are not being offered the vaccine yet. And incidentally just in case it helps anyone else in addition to starting Valtrex as soon as possible I think part of why I am not having any nerve pain and doing ok is that I also immediately started taking L Lysine L carnitine a B complex and alpha lipoid acid to support my nerves trying to heal after the infection.
10182,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Yeah I got the vaccine when I was 4 in 1996 and then at 14 my whole basketball team was coming down with chicken pox and I said no worry I had the vaccine and then I got chicken pox too.
10185,"03-27 05:56 - 'Can I ask where you live that they don't recommend that vaccine? Childhood chickenpox is a thing that's super fascinating to me because I was born slightly before the widespread promotion of the varicella vaccine in...' by /u/Masqueraver removed from /r/HistoryPorn within 3423-3433min: ''' Can I ask where you live that they don't recommend that vaccine? Childhood chickenpox is a thing that's super fascinating to me because I was born slightly before the widespread promotion of the varicella vaccine in the US and got chickenpox in...'98 I think. Whereas kids in school today barely even know what chickenpox is because of the vaccine. (Which is another reason why I don't understand antivaxxers since the effects of vaccines are concrete and observable in my lifetime!) But I know vaccination schedules aren't the same everywhere. Like for example, measles is still a common childhood ailment in Japan, where (the past 5 years aside) that's basically unheard of in the US.

10186,Question Bleeding after 2nd shingles vaccine and medication changes.: Vaccines because an immune response. For women that response can include changing periods schedules breakthru bleeding longer or shorter bleed times. The COVID shot did this to a lot of women and though we talked about it with each other there was very little mentioned in the media about it. Talk to your Dr if it is concerning.
10188,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: So far I have a slightly achy arm and thats about it."
10193,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Just had this happen to me too I had chicken pox as a kid and did not get the vaccine since it was assumed Id be immune. I apparently was not tested for rubella in my first pregnancy and it was only discovered now in my second pregnancy that I Am no longer immune. Ill be getting the vaccine as soon as I can after I give birth but it was totally news to me that immunity can wear off.
10200,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Got it on my face and eye literally on my corneabefore I was old enough for vaccine. Most pain I Have ever experienced and I Have had a child. Start to finish 4 weeks of pain. And I still have scars.
10201,I def felt achy and tired for like 2 days after each shingles vaccine However actual shingles can put you in weeks of excrutiating pain and the pain may be permanent as happened to someone I know. It lives in and damages nerves
10202,Hi friends. Just heard this on the news today. For those of us over 40 many of us had chicken pox as a kid and then once the vaccines were developed we were inoculated. That same virus stays dormant and can lead to shingles in older age. I Am in my 50s and saw my dad suffer through a rough but quick bout of shingles about a decade ago. We both had the vaccine in 2020 actually its 2 separate shots spaced over a short amount of time. They Are just MAYBE discovering a possible connection between shingles and dementia. Since many of us have witnessed first hand what a nightmare this disease is I thought Id share what seems to be a pretty simple way of perhaps improving our odds. Though my Jim Beam consumption still needs a bit of moderation Hope you are all having a calm day.
10203,Ah yes. And the second will be similar. BUT... it has benefits other than intended. Research indicates that it protects against Covid too. I got Covid a month after I had the Shingrix 2nd shot and my symptoms were negligible.
10209,Not loving the Shingrix side FX
10214,Shingles vaccine: Having had occular shingles the most severe kind typically I would urge everyone to get the vaccine even if it does make you ill Spent almost a month in hospital blacking out from pain and vomiting for 57 hours daily would not reccomend. I do have complicating medical conditions as lots of us do in my case eds pots but they basically asked me why I did not have the vaccine and I said I was worried before it would make me too ill seemed really silly in hindsight being ill from a vaccine is nothing like how bad actual shingles will make you
10216,"Allergic reaction to Hepatitis A vaccine: Female/25/Latina/5'3/120lbs I had to get the Hepatitis A vaccine for a trip I was planning to a high-risk area. However, after receiving the vaccine, I developed a blister-like rash on my stomach. The rash is itchy and uncomfortable, and I'm concerned that it might be an allergic reaction to the vaccine. I've consulted with healthcare professionals, but no one seems to have a clear answer on what could be causing this reaction. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the Hepatitis A vaccine, and how did you manage the symptoms?"
10224,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: to recognize shingles a red itchy rash it runs along a nerve on ONLY ONE SIDE of your body . when I had it started on one side of my back under my armpit and on the breast on that side of my body want to add in rare cases shingles can spread across both sides of the body a condition called disseminated shingles.This can be a medical emergency and requires immediate hospital attention
10226,"Shingles on back, family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: Where is your rash? Mine is around my waistline but if it wasn't, I'd be wearing a bandage. I'm just not sure what kind of bandage to wear... (suggestions, anyone?). I'm doing laundry every other day now, it's just crazy."
10230,Hello I am heading back to the ophthalmologist tomorrow per my docs instructions. Here is my journey so far. August 26 landed in ER after nearly two weeks of headaches. Felt like they started out as a tension headache that I thought I got from starting CPAP. Diagnosed with migraine and treated with migraine cocktail. Never really thought it was a migraine but whatevs. It was one of those if you get a suddennewsevere headache things... so I went. August 27 headache remains. Visit family doc get another shot of toradol for headache. Helps for about six hours. She recommends I see ophthalmologist about my ocular nerve that she cannot make out clearly. August 28 Around this time these two bumps show up on my face. Looks like bug bites maybe spider? Start taking pics. Headache remains. Throbbing stabbing. Right side of face temple head. Also feels like the same pain in my jawear canal. August 30 doc sends for CT scan. Clear. Sends to ophthalmologist to look at optical nerve close up. Clear. Headaches and facial pain remain. Scalp and temple are tender to the touch and have been for a few days. Hurts even running my hands through my hair. September 2 have some OK days some not OK days. Bumps are starting to get concerning looking. Headachefacial pain remains. Throbbing in ear canal. September 3 Doing some GoogleFu to see what kind of bug bites these things might be and come across something mentioning staph infectioncellulitis can sometimes mimick bugs bites. Wounds are oozing a little but not much. Getting kind of gross looking. Some pain around and on the wounds itself but most of the pain is in the earjawhead area. Did not get to bed last night until 4am. September 4 take my ass to urgent care. Get diagnosed with cellulitisimpetigo. Get antibiotics and topical ointment. My regular family doc sees these results in my charts via the app all the docs use here and messages me and says that with my severe headaches I am having which I did mention to the doc at urgent care that she thinks it is shingles. So back to the opthamologist I go tomorrowJust wanted to post this out there in case someone else follows the same path I did. And I will update onceif I get an actual diagnosis of shingles. At this point the wounds have been present since about September 2728. Three weeks of headaches but the headaches definitely changed around September 2526 a few days before the bumps showed up. The last couple of days the headachefacialearjaw pain kicks in around 4 5pm and persists through most of the evening. Any insight or thoughts are appreciated
10233,About to take my first dose Anxious: Most people do fine. The power of suggested side effects is strong. But most people especially on starting dose have shockingly low side effects worth noting other than a I felt off for an afternoon but so did my spouse who is not on ZB hmmm? Just remember in clinical trials EVERYTHING is reportable when it comes to side effects. Focus on this unique time in which we live this drug is doing incredible things and you get to take it. How lucky are you ?
10234,That vaccine is awful. I got really sick on shit 1 and 2 But I guess better than getting shingles
10235,I thought I was fine but maybe I am not. Absolutely exhausted.: When I get shingles I always feel like I have Mono or a really bad flu. And that is on top of the itchiness and pain. Your blisters poping and scabbing over just means you are not contagious anymore like if someone has never had the chicken pox you can give them chicken pox but not shingles. It usually takes me a couple months to feel back to normal. Everyone is different though. I know it sucks hang in there
10236,Shingrix?: You seem knowledgeable does this work this same way for Ramsay Hunt syndrome? I am in the midst of what I realize now is my second major flare since 2020? I just want my life back you know? It s so isolating dealing with vertigo tin n it us vision issues paralysis etc and I am just curious how to best treat what my dr s and I now realize is Ramsay Hunt syndrome? Of course no pressure to reply.
10241,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: We have a friend who is probably going to be blind in his eye due to shingles. It caused a retinal detachment and it is not healing well a year later unfortunately.
10243,Shingles vaccine experience: I have had shingles  and got the shot as soon as I turned 50. I am also a nurse and I have seen people in the ICU with complications from shingles  it is no joke.
10251,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I already have nerve damage and do not want the shingles to knock me down even more. My brother had it he was messed up. 2 shots easier than C19 shots. No arm pain for me at least. Some health departments give them for free.
10252,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: After I had it at age 47 not eligible for vaccine yet I told everyone I knew to get the vaccine at 50. Its sooo painful. Had it in my undercarriage and was unable to sit for days.
10253,Not a real thing technically. I just do not know how else to describe it. Currently April 2024 When I crash I wake up in the middle of night sweaty and breathing with rhonchi on exhalation. Right side only. My saturation is perfectly fine at 99 I do not even get shortness of breath nor a fever but there is something in my lungs and I can feel it. I mainly kept awake but the sheer discomfort of the rhonchi All of sudden I cough up a tiny pebble of green sputum and I feel much better. This happens anywhere between once to twice a week. I do not even feel tired aside from regular sleepiness it happens before I know it is too late. But I know it is always after a day with a lot of work. I go to an illustration school that specializes in narrative art. Comic books. Did not really know intense it would be when I applied here but I am. So I have to sit for 10 12 hours day and draw constantly until I get exhausted. If I want to finish this semester the next month will be hell. I got Covid for the first time in September 2023 teaching art classes for children. At the time I have had all vaccine and boosters except for the one released that fall. Teaching was a low paying weekend gig that I should have quit then and there but I kept going for two more months. I got some kind of walking pneumonia in november along with bounding pulse drenching night sweats brain fog dizzyness nightmares coughing fits at night only lungs filling with fluid and then I would cough it all up in the morning and besides for feeling a very beat up from all the coughing I would feel better quickly once I got the sputum out. In the first week it was yellow so I thought whoops looks like an upper respiratory infection. Good thing I coughed it all up so it must be over now. But the next night I would produce it again As my lungs filled I felt a feeling of them being full with accompanying brain fog and exhaustion But then I would cough it all up and feel better the next day. 24 hours and one good night sleep later the cycle would start back up again. What I thought would be few bad days turned into weeks and now months. This would continue in severity until it peaked in December. In retrospect I should have gone to urgent care right away ER anything. But I live at home and my family loves to gaslight so I was more concerned with being a nuisance than my health. Poor choice. The coughing started to last all night before expiration occurred and it became harder and harder to clear my chest. It was only at this peak did I have SOB. My saturation dropped to 94 and I went to urgent care I tested for flu RSV Covid all negative. But I still think it was covid. It could have been the start of my longhaul from the september infection the timing lines up but I found out so many of kids I had been teaching a week prior to symptoms appearing were covid positive so technically I got tested a month later than I should have. I am suspicious it was a reinfection. But without this confirmation doctors my primary pulmonologist look at me like I am crazy and nobody got sick from covid ever. The urgent care gave me a zpack some prednisone after the zpack ended etc. I got viral conjuctivitis while staying at home Got dexamethosone some antibiotic eyedrops. All these things helped and by February I feel much better than the walking corpse I was midwinter but the cough never really went away. Clear XRAY in january. As if the gunk comes and goes and I need to image it when its there. But we always rest the day before a doctor's appointment so I am never unhealthy when I need them to see and hear it ha. Blood tests showed a lot of normal results. Monocytes were a little high but not enough be to be flagged. I get flaking red cheeks on bad flare ups. Got the new booster I was late on in february. Moderna. No change in symptoms. No acute reaction to the jab either. Its a much longer cycle now Spent the majority of Late February and Early March getting good sleep but it always feels like there is a subtle tremor in my breathing now. I even went three weeks without coughing anything up aside from a small dry cough. I was am still going on 40 minute neighborhood walks. not shortness of breath still. But now finals are starting and deadlines are looming and I have to hit the grindstone again. It feels like this my the cough with the Rhonchi is starting up again first time since January and I am afraid of lung function suddenly declining again. I very recently had a pulmonologist appointment and she prescribed me albuterol but I tried to explain to her that symptoms happen when I am asleep and the morning and I cannot take a steroid right before bed I will not sleep at all. She hand waved this question away literally. I have a PFT on the 30th. Does this sound like anything you have experienced? Is it some kind of COPD? Is it some other kind of progressive lung diesease? Could it be a lingering bacterial infection? Will antibiotics fuck up my microbiome more than covid has? Can Gohan finally defeat Cell in the tournament? It distressing me so much I have searched the phrase lungs on this sub a hundred times. and past five months rereading threads multiple times. So I figured I should finally make my own post. At least to make like a diary of sorts. Thank you for reading EDIT Adding the word Lungs Lung ? So those searching it might find this thread
10256,Let Me tell you the booster is even harder ... but do it I did not get my shingles vac until after it popped up at the same time I had COVID19 and damaged my optic nerve with blisters.
10265,Shingles and GenX: The first one kicked my ass badly way worse than a covid shot. My second one which I took off work to recover from was not so bad.
10268,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the vaccine when I was a child. Fast forward 20 something years my 3 year old son got a mild case of the chicken pox. I caught it. I had a few chicken pox on my hands and many within my throat it got so bad I could not eat or drink water. The doctor gave me some medical menthols to suck on before eating which numbed the pain enough to where I could eat some soup. man that sucked.
10269,Shingles on back family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: The only way your family is going to get it if it pops or they touch it. Keeping it covered you should be fine. Once it starts getting in the scab stage then it is healing. I had shingles at 33 years old last month on 13 of february my left arm and talk about pain an could not really have any use of my arm or touch cold water. I still have some red marks still . It does get better. But just keep it covered and take not hot showers you should be fine. An take meds the doctor prescribed and use calamine lotion for the itching.
10270,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Based on my understanding of what our doctor said when he was in the hospital for 9 days it has taken decades to come up with a vaccine. It has been one of the most worked on vaccines that we have. My opinion is to get your child vaccinated as soon as possible. RSV is no joke. My son has been on a nebulizer for over two years. He had asthma and RSV took it to another level. Medical science is a miracle. The vaccine came out two years too late for us.
10272,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Neither one bothered me aside from a sore arm.
10274,Shingles and other Vaccines: I Am 42 and have gotten shingles five times. I got the vaccine early because of it. If I was sick from the vaccine for a month it still would have been worth it. Shingles is awful.
10277,FML... I got shingles: Schedule it tomorrow call as soon as the doctor opens. Do not put that step off. I had shingles on my scalp. It was like having goosebumps that were on fire. Plus full body aches and a whole lot more. I was 39.
10280,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I have had shingles you are not being dramatic. Even though mine was not too ' bad ' and I got those meds for it pretty quickly it was still painful enough Hang in there OP
10281,Shingles vaccine: I had mild side effects with both shots but nothing too severe
10282,I never thought I had chicken pox But I must have had a mild case that went unnoticed or SOMETHING because I have a mild case of shingles right now on my lower backabove my butt crack. By the time I was able to get to a doctor for the rash they said it was too late for antivirals Is it possible for shingles to show up with just the chicken pox vaccine? I am so confused and itchy I got vaccinated later in life junior in high school parents were vaccine for most of my life is that a factor at all? I am starting to think that I got chicken pox as a kid and my mom forgot or something. I do not know
10283,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: My sister got shingles from the vaccine. I thankfully have not.
10284,Shingles vaccine: I get the flu shot every year due to low resistance. Dr recommended shingles vac my father got shingles many years ago and it was brutal. I never get a reaction from the flu shot but I felt slight flulike symptoms the next day after each shot. Its a two parter. Or it was a few years ago. I still worked.
10289,A word of warning: Mine was on the right side of my torso doctor diagnosed me with shingles and the prescription thankfully took care of it right away. But yeah I just wanted people to be aware because as I understand it the sooner you take care of it the less chance it has to spread and become chronic pain
10291,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: For me the second shot was not nearly as bad as the first. Hopefully you will be the same
10292,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: Same just had the second one last month.
10293,First shingles vaccine side effects: Totally understand and agree. Unfortunately I already have POTS so this strong immune system response is not helping my preexisting condition at all.
10297,Hi I know there are other posts on this. My doctor is doing a study on how the shingles vaccine impacts people with lupus. I signed on for it but I have not been feeling great and I Am finally starting to bounce back. I Am concerned about triggering another flare with the vaccine. I also know that shingles is terrible and I want to get the vaccine at some point. Curious how people who have had it have reacted. Is it like the Covid vaccine? Maybe 24 hours of feeling crappy and then it passes? I Am just so tired of feeling crappy and do not want to feel any worse right now but also think its probably worth it to push myself to avoid shingles.
10299,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: My second shot was no worse than the first but barely a month later OHSU reported a study that suggests switching arms improves effectiveness so you might want to go with the other arm I usually choose my nondominant arm for shots blooddraws
10300,Shingles vaccine: My mother in law got shingles on her face. She lost hearing in her right ear and part of her right face is paralyzed. Get the jab.
10303,Got them on my face: PS. My shingles were all over my scalp my forehead my eyelid and eyebrow. I sure feel your pain.
10306,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: This happened to me at 26 it was SUCH a mild case. I was in disbelief when the dermatologist diagnosed it as shingles. I had a couple blisters on one eyebrow and that was it. My boyfriend at the timenow husband still says its BS because he had shingles in his 20s as well on his forehead but it was a pretty severe case.
10307,Same happened to me with the Shingles vaccine but I had been told that could happen.
10309,RSV Vaccine Side Effects: If it does not go away after today definitely. But a 24 hour thing I have to imagine its the vaccine. I Am starting to feel hot and less chilled but still achy so I hope that means its moving through. I also took Tylenol before my nap
10313,On another topic wife I both had our 2nd shingles vaccine. She still got shingles Dr says it is very mild so far. But still contagious.
10314,Essential T cells: My ex husband took 5 jabs the lurgy x 3. He now has a lymphoma with kidney insufficiency and oedema also a blood clot in one leg. Previously fit and well. But there was no waking him up
10316,Shingles vaccine experience: Just all the weird after effects are enough to make me want to not get it again. For close to a year I could not sleep more than 45 minutes at a time.
10317,Shingles vaccine experience: More than a few of my friends from the Gulf war came down with various cancers in their 30's. It does make you wonder what the heck happened. Still should get the shingles vaccine. I got the first and forgot to get the second and got mild shingles like 6 months later.
10322,Shingles vaccine experience: I got the first single shot. The next week my wife now exwife got shingles. I still look back on that and chuckle.
10326,Shingles vaccine experience: Both of mine shots were fine other than a pretty sore arm for a couple of days. Definitely better than dealing with shingles.
10328,My sister got Shingles and had to lay on the floor of her work coffee room because of the pain. I got my shot the next day
10330,"Shingles rash emerging two days post COVID vaccine: Following my Johnson & Johnson vaccine on 5/5, I noticed a red, patchy rash on my back on 5/7. At first, I attributed it to a new body wash, but the rash continued to develop, spreading towards my shoulder blade. The itching and soreness reminded me of a sunburn, but the linear pattern of the rash raised concerns. I consulted a healthcare professional who prescribed antiviral medication, but now I'm experiencing heightened pain and nerve discomfort. I'm worried about the potential for lingering symptoms or recurrent outbreaks. My doctor suggested the vaccine may have triggered the shingles, but advises proceeding with the second dose. Any advice or similar experiences to share with me?"
10333,I posted over two years ago how staff at a local care home watched shingles sweep through after each round of vaccine
10337,Shingles again?: Thank you so much for the detailed response First off wow. 5 or 6 outbreaks how awful I Am so sorry you have to deal with that. I truly cannot imagine I Have only had it the one time and never want it again. I am feeling better today but still off? And so confused as to how I had classic shingles onset symptoms and now it seems to be disappearing but my ribcage feels so bruised. I have spent the past year trying to seek answers or a diagnosis for my own health concerns. Best I Have gotten so far is a confirmation that I am on the hypermobility spectrum. Basically cannot confirm EDS. But I know my health is not optimal and never has been. Obviously since I got shingles when I was 34. I took the day off tomorrow. And if I still feel off tomorrow Ill hit the walkin. And I see my regular doc in a few weeks so I Am going to bring this up then. Something is going on. I even thought today I had what I think was a crazy acne outbreak on my forehead in December. It was painful but no symptoms like shingles I recall. But what if it was and I missed it? Do Not worry about offloading your thoughts on to me I tend to do the same back
10341,Shingles vaccine: I have been putting it off but I am thinking I should just get it done soon. I did not catch chickenpox until I was 16 and felt like I was going to die. Covid shots were no big deal arm just hurt for a while. Flu shots knock me out for about a day though. I have to get them done late in the week so I have the weekend to recover.
10344,First shingles vaccine side effects: I ended up laying on the couch the next day both times with chills aches then too hot etc.
10349,Why do all vaccines make me sick?: If vaccines give you vomiting you may be having ANAPHYLAXIS. I would go to the hospital. It is VERY likely you have an allergy to some component of the vaccine. Anaphylaxis can be different and can change every time you are exposed to an allergen. It may not be safe for you to get these vaccines without medical supervision. Normalcommon vaccine side effects feeling a little sick from about 8 hours to about 24 hours after vaccinations including fatigue mild fever 102 body aches small rednessirritation at the site of the vaccine sore arm for a few days 5 days fainting within a few moments of vaccination vasovagal reaction Abnormal side effects experiencing any requires medical evaluation vomitingdiarrhea especially it onset is within 1 hour but up to 24 hours after vaccination shortness of breath throat swelling hives arm pain that prevents moving the arm or unusual feelings of paintinglingweakness that lasts 7 days faintingdizzinesslow blood pressure 15 minutes or more after vaccination Vaccines are some of the best things you can do for your health but people can develop allergies to anything at any time Some folks cannot get vaccines for these and other reasons and that is why the rest of us have to step up to protect our communities.
10353,Shingles vaccine: Dammit I should have gone to my doctor instead of that guy with the medical van in the Walmart parking lot. No wonder I had such weird side effects and lost my wallet and phone
10354,and i have had shingles twice from the vac and it reactivated EBV as well seems to reactivate all latent retroviruses
10355,Shingles vaccine: Shingles is misery for weeks instead of days. I do not remember getting sick from the shots. Your Thanksgiving might be uncomfortable though.
10356,Got my Shingles vaccine: I Have had shingles three times  all across the right side of my forehead and eye. The worst pain in my life the first time but then I knew the signs so got antivirals into me immediately on the latter break outs. The vaccine is a bit of a pain but so worth it
10357,"Neurologist- PHN: It's nearly a year since I had shingles on the side of my face and neck, and I have seen ENT for tinnitus and now being referred to Neurology to manage the pain (I think) Has anyone had much help for PHN from Neurology? Wondering what I should expect. The pain comes and goes but is not going completely. I have other pain from previous shingles years ago on my back so wondering if this will be permanent."
10358,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Early 90's and I was 25. My son is vaccinated so he will not get it neither shingles. The good old fashion way nearly left me blind from one eye I took 2 years to fully recover. And seeing how badly my mom still suffers from her shingles from 1989 no thanks.
10359,I have had the shingles vaccine but have mild dementia.
10363,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Oh heck yeah. Both hubby and I down for a week.
10369,I have had reactions to shots before but the 2nd shingles shot was just a little soreness. My 90 and 75 yo neighbors scheduled their shots with mine and we made it a party. Sure beats my 40 yo coworker who got shingles and had to spend the summer on Oxy due to the pain.
10376,Shingles vaccine: Got both shots. Had zero reaction.
10378,Shingles vaccine experience: I worked in a nursing home when I was in my teens and had a resident with shingles. I was just a student employee so it was my job to rub lotion into her legs to help with the pain. It was awful to see. This woman was writhing with pain. I will get my shingles vaccine as soon as my doctor offers it to me. Thanks so much for sharing your story I am glad to hear it was not that bad for you. My parents have also both had the vaccine and also had slightly sore arms as their only side effect.
10379,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I was due for a round of shots when I was at my Doctor. He listed them all that I was due for them and was going to schedule a series of vaccinations. I asked why cannot you just do them all now? His response was medically there are no complications to worry about. however your arm will hurt from multiple injections and they will probably knock you out for a few days. my thought tomorrow is my friday off... i am good through sunday... how bad can it be? Well... it sucked... I was horizontal all day fridaysaturdaysunday and monday was so back I called in sick.
10381,Please do not take Gardasil  HPV Vaccine: My son has taken all 3 he is 16 years old.. I would not even think twice About if it protects him from the emotional agony I have experienced..and I recommend it to everyone I know who has kids.
10384,Shingles Vaccine?: Not after but immediately before GBS. I had both the shingles and flu vaccines nine days before symptoms and diagnosis. Both have been associated with GBS. Since then I have not gotten a flu shot and have not gotten the second shingles shot both on my doctor's recommendation.
10386,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick but it was one of the most sore I have been from a shot.
10390,RSV vaccine during pregnancy Abrysvo: I totally get how you are feeling. You grasp to try to find anything to pin it on. I did not make it to the 32 week mark to get Abrysvo but it comforted me to blame my first covid vaccine that I got at the beginning of my second trimester. Got preeclampsia and was hospitalized for a month before having my baby at 28w so that is the main reason for the NICU but I have wondered if the vaccines did not make my symptoms worse or because his increased difficulty once he was born. I know this is not logical and I will definitely be getting vaccines for myself and baby going forward but I very much get it. In my case postpartum hormones extreme stress grasping at straws led to complete distrust of all medical staff and paranoid delusions that they were sacrificing my baby to punish me. I had to be put on an antipsychotic in order to calm down and look at things logically. Not saying your case will be the same at all. But I would absolutely recommend you talk about these feelings and anything else that comes up with someone you trust. This is such a hellish experience no matter what brings you to the NICU and I am so sorry.
10395,Shingles vaccine: Either way its far better than actually having Shingles. My Mother came down with it about 67 years ago and she was quite ill and in real pain. Also is blind in her right eye due to a large lesion right on her eye and foreheadskull. Its fuckin no joke
10397,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had shingles twice before being old enough to get the shot and I can assure you the day or two of suckass feeling from the shot is infinitely better than actual shingles.
10400,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I am currently in my 3rd week of shingles at 43. it is in my eye and awful but thankfully I should not have permanent vision loss. Though insurance is unlikely to pay for it before age 50 in the US anyway I have no idea how difficult it would be to get the vaccine in other countries I would still recommend paying the approximately 375 out of pocket to get both shot shots. Sure you probably will not get it before 50 but if you do it is terrible. Because it is affecting my eye I am still work from home when I can stand staring at a computer screen I am rather depressed I can hardly go anywhere besides appointments with the eye doctor we have spent God knows how much now on 2 ER visits plus other doctor visits and medications 400 for eye drops. One ER visit pre rash included an MRI to rule out bigger problems that might explain the God awful headache that this thing started out as. Get the vaccine
10408,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I am immunocompromised as a result of cancer treatment so my doctor absolutely wanted me to get it and I did. I did feel kind of bad for a few days but not nearly as bad as shingles would have been
10409,Shingles Vaccine?: I had the shingles when I was in home hospice before I started the process again for my transplant. I would not die lol. That being said omg it sucked. It followed a nerve up the back of my head and scarred it up pretty good. I am just glad it did not get to my face. I was not pre transplant then so I did not have the vaccine nor was it ever brought up. Probably because of hospice though. Almost forgot about it until this post. 2 years with the transplant now and that seems so long ago. Feels like centuries since I was shitting myself in icu haha. Anyway I would not recommend.
10412,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got the shingles shot in 2020. I thought for sure I was coming down with Covid and then I read all of the side effects from the Shingrix  ticked ALL the boxes.
10419,Had mine a month back. Also took about 10 hrs to kick in. Bed ridden for a day and a half. Hit by a truck barely describes it. Rather that than shingles though The antivirals only work if taken within 72 hrs make that 48 of onset
10422,Had the second shingles shot: I had chicken pox when I was a kid and got shingles at age 46. It was horrendous and I still have mild nerve pain three years later
10423,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Omg karma I also learned that some people are at a higher risk of stroke after having shingles as it happened to my mum when I was a teen. Not saying that will happen in this case but... Karma
10424,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: For whatever reason shingles is on the rise in younger people. We live in a much more stressful time with high paced lifestyles and so many moving parts. When I got shingles it was during a big case in court. It got delayed for a month and I had massive stress and anxiety because of the delay. Started with a four day migraine on the side where the shingles manifested and grew into two weeks of living hell. 1000 do not recommend
10428,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I had shingles when I was 19 and worse than the itching was that entire side was extremely sensitive and painful. Just my shirt brushing against it sometimes hurt. But I was lucky to get it young because I was still pretty much able to do everything I normally would. I hear it is way worse when you are older
10430,I am 39F who had shingles about 9 months ago. It appeared on the base of my neck and I had rashes that went down my upper left arm as well. I took the anti virals within the first 3 days but was still in agonizing pain. I had to go back multiple times and was eventually put on gabapentin which gets me through the day. I was intially on 2 pills a day 3 times a day but very recently have been able to lower my dose to 1 pill a day but I am unable to get off of it completely. A few weeks ago I was in between refills and I was in so much pain when I had to go 2 days without. I used to run but have not since before getting shingles I found myself wanting to get back into it for my mental health because dealing with postherpetic nuerglia from shingles has been quite a hit on my mental health. Today I tried to run again and I noticed that I had that excuriating pain in my upper armshoulder area. I recongize that shingles shows up in different places so I am not sure if this is a good question but I would like to know if anyone has found any form of excerising that does not bother their nerve pain???? I practice yoga daily and even then sometimes I have to modify if its too much weight bearing in my shoulders but i would like to add back some excerise routine. thanks in advanced
10432,Starting methotrexate and shingles vaccine: Yep mine was the same I just put cold packs on my arm. It lasted several days maybe not for you though but the booster shot was easier I was only sore over night. I know it sucks but shingles is evil Good luck with your mtx Lots of people have great success with it
10434,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Hey OP sorry about the shingles. I had it like 15 years ago and it fucking hurts. Nothing to add about the chickenpox partyjust wanted to commiserate on how much shingles sucks. Hope you feel better soon
10435,Shingles vaccine experience: First things I did when turning 50 was schedule a colonoscopy and get the shingles vaccine Both shots of the vaccine made me feel like crap for a day. I Have had friends who had shingles. Feeling like crap for a day was nothing compared to what they dealt with
10436,Shingles vaccine: I did Covid flu and shingles all at once. If you are going to feel like ass ya do it all at once. You will not be 3x sick then its over with
10438,Shingles vaccine: I got the vaccine around 6 years ago. No reaction and never had shingles.
10442,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles at 14 on my knee. It was awful. I Italy thought I was bitten by a spider several times then the skin and joint pain kicked in. The worst two months of my teenage years.
10447,Mi sa che davveronon gli resta Che provare a distruggerci tutti Con l'atomica. Monkeypox is a coverup for damage done to Immune System by COVID Vaccination resulting in Shingles Autoimmune Blistering Disease Herpes Infection via
10448,I got HPV last December and am about to get retested to see if I cleared it or not. A friend told me that having hpv puts me at a heightened risk of cancer for the rest of my life..but I wonder what if I manage to clear the virus will my risk for cancer be that of someone without hpv? Or is it always going to be in my body and will reactivate when my immune system is low and because cancer? So basically I Am doomed? I feel depressed. Also I assume my male partner has hpv since were intimate and I strongly assume he gave it to me since I was a virgin before him and consistently tested negative for hpv up until I slept with him for the first time. I wonder if my body will always be unable to clear it since he might keep passing it back to me? So for as long as were together well always have hpv? I got the first hpv vaccine a month after being intimate with my partner and was diagnosed with hpv just before deciding to get the vaccine and now I Have completed all three shots.
10450,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I got chickenpox as a child early 1980's baby. In my late teens and early 20's I got three doses of the chickenpox vaccine. Still I got shingles and it was pretty awful. Thankfully I caught it really early a friend who lived out of state had just had it and described the symptoms exactly the same. So starting meds within 2 days of the rash really helped. I read that the shingles vaccine is 19 times stronger than the chicken pox vaccine. So maybe it will help?
10451,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: No way my last two times were also under my eye but my right eye. My cousin also had shingles in her early twenties and it took forever to diagnose her husband had just come back from a tour in the Gulf War and they thought it was some kind of crazy spider bite that he may have brought home in his bags. They were really worried she would lose her eye but thankfully she did recover with no lasting problems. Shingles is no joke
10453,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: If you have had shingles you are not off the hook. I had shingles by my eyes. Worse pain ever I got the shot do not want that again
10456,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: This was me too And it was for the second shingles shot which I have been told AND experienced is worse than the first one. Going forward I will only do 12 vaccines at a time as well.
10457,"Shingrix Vaccine who's had this vaccine? What side effects did you experience? Did you get shingles after being vaccinated? I know someone who did. ??She said it wasn't as bad, painful for about two weeks."
10458,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: It was irrelevant to me --- I had shingles years ago and it was the single most horrible medical condition I have ever had. I took the vaccine just as extra insurance (yes, you CAN get it again) First shot was like mild aches and pains. Second was like a rough flu. Glad I took the day off!!"
10461,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: Thank you so much for your reply. I'm so sorry to hear you have permanent nerve damage. I'm really hoping that doesn't happen to me. I can't imagine this pain going on indefinitely"
10463,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the vaccines but as an avid reader I remember that there were a LOT of book series where there would be at least one book where the main character gets chicken pox. Really made it seem like it was a rite of passage of sorts.
10471,Shingles vaccine: Same for me had it almost 20 years ago and it was the worst experience of my life. The minute I can get the shots I am doing it. And my side still hurts sometimes too.
10473,I do not react to any vaccines as well however the shingles vaccine is the only one I have yet to get. I Have heard of many peoples stories so I keep postponing it. A friend just had his first one last week and had no reaction. It made me feel a little better.

10482,Humira gave me shingles: Mine did. When you take immunosuppressants your immune system gets suppressed. Shingles is the result of a weak immune system if you have the virus in your body.
10488,Shingles vaccine: I got both shots already. Did Not get any side affects nor did I get the shingles. Yes my arm was hurting so bad
10493,Shingles and other Vaccines: For Covid try the vaccine vaccine. Its just like the flu shot instead of a mRNA shot. I had gotten so sick from Pfizer and Moderna and the vaccine was smooth sailing

10503,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: This is so strange that it was not offered Here in Quebec they called me to MAKE SURE I knew it was available  asked if I wanted to have it done. When I told them my baby was not yet vaccinated but was going to be soon they said great ask for it at the office when you go He was vaccinated for RSV with his first set of vaccines at 2 months on the day.
10505,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: How on earth did you deal with that? You poor booboo I got it when I was a kid and this year at 45. I still have nerve pain from it. It was one of the worst experiences of my life.
10506,Shingles vaccine: That happened to my wife it was on the side of her head and her eye hurt bad. 2 ER docs thought it was a migraine. Eye doc 2 days later knew what it was but it was late for the anti viral drug to work well. Still bothers her after 6 years. Our doc got it when he was in his 30s. My late dad also got it in his late 70s and was miserable for a few weeks. Get the shot
10507,Covid Vaccine Reaction and Shingrix: Where did you have the n europa thy and muscle weakness? Was it at the site of the injection or full body?
10509,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: This is exactly how my mom figured out she had shingles. Lower back pain and thought it was muscle damage then she got a muscle cream and it triggered the breakout so she thought she just had a bad reaction to the cream but it was shingles
10513,My elderly mum ended up in hospital when she had shingles. She had pain for a while afterwards yes get vaccinated
10514,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Same thing happened to me as well. Luckily it was during my undergrad and was able to be seen at the campus clinic. Mine was right under my left boob and went around to my back. It was just on the left side and it was sooo painful.
10515,"diagnosed with shingles today: The symptoms of shingles vary so much that, probably, only a very experienced dermatologist can spot it a glance, as mine did. At your age you probably fought off the virus with your own body immunity. You can probably expect it to reoccur. Should you take the vaccine, good question which only an immunologist could answer."
10521,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel any better the chicken pox vaccine can also give you shingles. My wife got them via the vaccine. I am not anti vaccine or anything by the way just throwing it out there since I know from personal experience.
10522,Sacral Nerve Shingles and Secondary Urine Retention: Bless his heart! I hope he gets over this soon. Nobody deserves to go through all that!
10523,Shingles vaccine experience: I just bit the bullet too. Similar deal mad arm no other side effects.
10532,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My baby got it and he was fine. Speak with your doctor they know more than randos on Reddit. Plus vaccines go through thorough testing way before they go commercial. Look up the different FDA drug phases and the number of people tested.
10537,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had a bad case of chicken pox when I was 5 and a fairly bad case of shingles when I was 8. I have never heard anyone else mention shingles in a child before until now. My doctor said shingles was an old person issue so I feel alittle better about that whole event knowing I am not the only one I had a big patch on my side and back and it was probably the most painful thing I have ever had and I have had numerous injuries. I still remember how bad it felt. It took what felt like forever to go away. So I made sure all five of my kids were vaccinated for chicken pox even in 1997 when it first came out because that was a horrible experience. I am still too young to get the shingles vaccine and my Dr's have said I should not get them again since I had a bad case before but they also said you normally do not get shingles if you had a bad case of chicken pox. I saw how that went and as soon as I am able I will be getting vaccinated. I never want to go through that again. Shew..
10539,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I was in my 30s and a tick bite on my back triggered them according to the dr. Had a lovely rash right along my bra line for weeks and the only good thing was having doctor's orders not to wear a bra. Shingles was not even on the long list of things I worried about.
10540,Shingles vaccine: Definitely get the vaccine both shots. No side effects either. I had shingles along my sideunder breast and it was the worst I was on Neurontin for 6 weeks for the nerve pain. I know a guy who had it on his face. Even though I had it and may not get it again an immunologist friend said to get vaccine
10546,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Wait what is controversial about the RSV vaccine? The pediatrician said it was safe and recommended it so I gave it to my 2 month old. Now I Am stressing out
10549,My dad gf is getting over shingles: I Am vaccinated and they tested for immunity this pregnancy and I Have lost my immunity.
10550,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My wife got hers years ago but I got mine the day after my 50th birthday. Our son had it in his 30s it was brutal had it on his back and around his eyes.
10551,Has anyone experienced Flulike symptoms with their first or later dose?: Not the sore throat part but yes to the other stuff. I thought I had food poisoning or Covid. Weak chills insomnia gerd and otherworldly diarrhea for four whole days to the point that I nearly went to the hospital. It settled down a little bit after 4 days but now a couple months in and I am still having issues. It is def the meds. The sore throat could be from gerd while you sleep just a guess.
10557,Shingrix for 50yr olds: sorry to hear that I am 31 and 4 weeks after the initial outbreak I am just a bit itchy where the last few scabs are. I hope you get better
10559,I did that last year because they insisted on giving me the shingles vaccine as well. 2 nights of not being comfortable sleeping on either side. Hope you recover sooner.
10560,Shingles shot Ack: A word of caution do not get it done or any vaccines at Walmart. They stab super hard I bled quite a lot after they stabbed me. It felt like they hit bone ffs. I am getting my second shot done at my drs officethey fortunately have it back in stock and the nurse they is great at doing vaccines
10561,GenX Shingrix: Omg yes My bestie had it on her forehead and face. Her eyes swelled shut. Scar on her forehead. 2 months she was down with it. So I am absolutely getting the 2nd jab.
10562,Any tips on how to make shingrix less painful?: Pinch up the skin together not hard but the pressure on the other nerves dulls the senses a bit. Also everything they said switch needle after mixing get rid of your junk 1 5 inch stuff you will not use often.
10563,"Long Term Side Effects from HPV vaccination. Joint pain, fatigue, and skin rashes: Received the HPV vaccine a few months ago and have been experiencing some unexpected side effects. I've been dealing with persistent joint pain, extreme fatigue, and random skin rashes that just won't go away. Doctors seem puzzled and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. Anyone else facing similar issues after getting the HPV vaccine? Would appreciate any insights or advice."
10566,My wife listened to her Dr. last year and she gave her the shingles and flu vaccine no idea why she said yes at the same time. We ended up in the ER the following day. Ghouls
10569,Shingles vaccine: I got the shakes and felt like crap for a night but it was worth it. My wife had shingles in her face and she went thru hellish pain. A couple hours of chills I will take it.
10570,"Blister formation after receiving second Varicella vaccine: Non-binary/22/Mixed race/6'0/160lbs I received my first Varicella vaccine when I was younger but missed out on the second dose. As a twenty-two-year-old non-binary individual, I had to get the second vaccine for a volunteer program I'm a part of. I have never experienced chickenpox before. After receiving the vaccine, I noticed a blister-like formation on my lower back, close to where the shot was given. It initially appeared as a rash and later developed into a blister after I removed the bandage. It's slightly itchy and occasionally tingles, but not too bothersome. I'm concerned because I haven't come across any information about blisters being a common reaction to the vaccine. I'm unsure if this could be a sign of chickenpox or increase my risk of shingles. Despite consulting with healthcare professionals, including pharmacists and a doctor, no one has been able to provide a definitive explanation. I'm turning to the Reddit community for additional insights and advice on what this could be and if it warrants further attention. Any input would be greatly valued."
10571,"Novavax booster or mRNA booster?: I developed CUI and post viral fatigue syndrome after a bad flu about a decade ago, and that left me almost bedridden for two years. Ever since then I religiously get a flu shot every year. I definitely don't want to know what will happen if I catch Covid, so I am adamant about getting one or the other, but I can't decide between Novavax or an mRNA booster. >An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the recipient's immune response to the vaccine. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) do not contain an adjuvant. The protein-based vaccine (Novavax) contains the same adjuvant used in the shingles vaccine. Adjuvants are known to sometimes cause problems in people with autoimmune conditions. Many of my mast cell mediated conditions are autoimmune. Only nasal vaccines contain mast cell activators, as far as I know, but it still makes me nervous. I had an extreme health decline and anaphylactic allergy multiplication immediately after getting my hepatitis vaccines. This was an escalation of my MCAS that took about a year to get to the point where it almost killed me, so it isn't clear cause and effect. And in the same timeframe I was also eating a very high nickel plant-based diet, despite my nickel allergy. (I wasn't aware that nickel was a dietary concern.) Further complicating the picture, this was also only four years after that bad flu. After all the Covid mRNA vaccines, I developed severe inflammatory arthritis and interstitial cystitis. But in the same timeframe I also tried taking a progesterone only birth control pill that gave me absolutely horrific side effects, so it could be down to that. Again, no clear cause and effect. It does leave me very unsure as to which booster I should choose. I'm curious what others with MCAS have chosen."
10574,41 and got Shingles: my son got shingles at 15. so crazy. my husband got it at 46 it affected his eye. he still has to use prescription drops once a week bcuz of flare ups.
10575,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: YEP Got chicken pox around the age of 2. I Am in my early 30s and I Have had shingles TWICE. The chicken pox vaccine was not out yet when I was a kid. First time I got shingles was when I was 10 years old. It was all over the left side of my torso. The doctors said its the worst case they have ever seen. I still have nasty scars from it. The second time thankfully was not too bad and cleared up in about a week. Asked my pharmacy about the vaccine for shingles and they told me I can only get it if I Am immunocompromised. Id have to jump through a few hoops to get it. So now I get to wait until I Am 50 to get the vaccine.
10576,Back pain flare up: Thank you for the advice I have not explored the cannabis drops but did take an edible the other night because I had not slept in days. This has just been terrible. My rash is on the downside and scabbing but still very sore to the touch I Am hoping I do not have more longer left with this. I Am absolutely getting the vaccine when this has run its course. I do not ever want to go through this again
10577,41 and got Shingles: I was 41 when I got it. It was right before Covid hit. I have permanent nerve damage. My skin only feels pressure in a strip from my lower back around my hip and into the top of my thigh. The same path of the shingles.
10578,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the vaccine as a child. But I still got shingles twice.
10581,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom has a friend who got it as an adult and it was the worst experience of her life. She had pox on the underside of her eyelids and in her mouth down her throat. She was also hospitalized for about a week.
10583,Shingles vaccine: Super painful like NOTHING can touch your affected skin not even a bedsheet and an overwhelming sense of tired like cannot walk a half block. Goes on for weeks and weeks. Get the shots to avoid all that.
10586,Vaccinations?: Yes get the vaccines. I had already had all of mine because I Am a nurse and it was required for nursing school. I also opted for Hep A EVERYONE who eats out ever should get the Hep A as its passed by feces mostly through lack of proper handwashing and caught by eating food prepared by someone who did not wash hands well. Humira makes you more susceptible to infections. Vaccines help prevent severe illness. Finally if you have ever had chicken pox you can get shingles at any time your immune system is compromised even a cold can because shingles to sting up. If you qualify for a shingles vaccine and can benefit from it get it. I have issues developing immunity. I cannot achieve immunity for measles chicken pox or rubella despite being vaccinated multiple times and having had chicken pox multiple times. It SUCKS. If you have the ability to protect yourself you definitely should
10587,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I lost track of time and did not get a shingles shot last fall when I got shingles I did not work for two months and five months in I still suffer from Post Herpetic Neuralgia. Those side effects do not sound so bad.
10588,Wait a minute was not shingles already on the COVID19 vaccines greatest hits list of side effects? You know right up there with sore arms mild fevers and that general feeling of what did I just inject into my body? Its like a bonus prize no one asked for Because who
10589,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Caught at school age 5 transmitted to infant brother who now 65 years later has shingles. He asked me to say get the vaccine I did
10590,Shingles vaccine: Well I was miserably sick for 23 days both times. Body aches tired headache some nausea. But yeah still better than getting shingles.
10597,27F Four days ago I woke up with swelling and pain in my right temple jaw and neck. It also hurt to open my mouth and chew. I also had what looked like the start of a rash on the right side of my neck as well. The ER doc said it might be the start of shingles and prescribed three days of Prednisone. I have never had Chicken Pox and have been vaccinated against it as well. I also tried Advil Tylenol Benedryl and Claritin. Nothing seems to make it feel better but it has not gotten worse either. I brought up giant cell arteritis but they said I was too young and dismissed that quickly. Any ideas? I have an appointment with my primary care doctor but that is over two weeks from now and I am worried about waiting that long.
10599,I Am 61F and kept meaning to get the shingles vaccine but life you know? About two weeks ago I noticed what I thought was just a rash under my left arm at the bra line. I figured it was from new laundry detergent. By the time I realized it was shingles it was already day 4. I looked it up online and here on Reddit and saw that antivirals do not do much after 72 hours so I decided to just tough it out. Plus I Have got a new highdeductible insurance plan so I was trying to save money. Huge mistake I Am pretty private do not usually post but I do not want anyone else to go through what I Have been dealing with. The pain and discomfort have been next level. Honestly I would not wish this on my worst enemy. If you have been putting off the shingles vaccine let this be your reminderjust go get it
10603,Shingles at 35: I went for a run back to back Sunday and Monday and afterwards I was so sore Thought it was bc I had not run in awhile but that was not the case when 4 pimple clusters appeared on my upper back.. followed by Wednesday with a side slash rash. Thursday with a horseshoe rash on my right breast. Pictures to share The top left first day Wednesday 36 The top right Thursday 37 The bottom left when I stopped taking prednisone my back shot up like the 4th of July 39 immediately started back on the prednisone The bottom right 310 I did not experience popping blisters or ooze is that normal?
10604,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox when I was 10. Just got my first case of shingles a few months ago at 40. So painful pretty much could not move for a few days. So thankful my kids at least got to chicken pox vaccine.
10605,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel better I had stress induced shingles at 31.

10609,Shingles: My wife is dealing with Shingles outbreaks. I do not wish that on anyone. I got the shingles vaccine.
10610,Get your shingles vaccine: I feel your pain I m just recovering from my shingles experience. I was supposed to get the vaccine at the end of July so I guess I can push that out for a year.
10617,Shingles vaccine: Got both shots last year I Am 65 yo and felt fine. No reaction at all. I Am sorry you had a bad reaction but glad you got them shingles are a horrible thing to have severe nerve pAin for months to years with blisters that crust over. My son got them at 8 years old due to an illness that lowered his immune system brutal.
10619,How long do I have to wait for shingles vaccine? Those with recurring outbreaks did you get the vaccine?: Shingles because nerve pain because it multiplies in the nerve cells. I get involuntary muscle contractions in my right arm and forearm on and off. This possibly also due to nerve initiation. Did anyone in the group experienced muscle contractions.
10622,Anyone feel like they got hit by a bus after getting Shingrix Vaccine?: That happened to me with all my C covid v x.
10625,My first case of shingles. Hopefully my last. It sucks. Its fine. Get vaccinated

10628,Shingles vaccine: Had them both they were not pleasant but they were no worse than other shots. My sister got shingles and that was horrible. Shots much better than that.
10629,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It was bad. I Am glad I did it but it was awful
10630,Shingles vaccine experience: As I said on that earlier post it was the worst pain I would had in a while and I hated it but at least it was not fucking shingles
10632,Shingles vaccine: 50 F. Felt a little tired the next day and the injection site reminded me subtly of a tetanus shot. Was reminded I was eligible since my birthday just happened from an older coworker who told me her son got shingles on his face ears and scalp the worst being the first 2 weeks then not fullly cleared for over a month and now has some type of neuropathy by his ears that may be permanent. I noped right to the pharmacy and got my first in the series. Eligible to go back next month to get second dose and pharmacist did warn me the second one can be a bit of a doozy but that vaccine sickness cannot be worse than the actual shingles.
10633,LO is 7 months old. She has been sleeping in a pack and play in our bedroom. This was going well. I would nurse her to sleep in a side lying position then DH would scoop her up and transfer her. She would either sleep through the night or wake up once for a diaper change. I would nurse her back to sleep and she would fall asleep quickly and I could transfer her. This suddenly changed last week. We took her to get a flu booster and rsv shot. I do not know if a sleep regression happened to occur on the same night or what. Now I can get her to sleep but once DH or I transfer her she instantly wakes up. It does not matter how many times we try. She wakes up as soon as she is no longer in our arms or bed. I have resorted to cosleeping out of desperation which is something I really do not want to do. DH is sleeping on the couch because I am afraid he might roll over on LO and squish her. I have tried letting her fuss for a little while in her pack and play while I try to shush her and keep my hands on her or rub her back. She refuses to settle unless I pick her up. We tried the crib in her nursery last night and the result was the same. We sleep with a fan on for white noise. I do not know what to do. I do not want to cosleep long term and DH cannot stay on the couch forever. I do not want to just let her cry it out.
10636,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I am 46 had cp at 5 years old was exposed each time my kiddos had them then got shingles right about 40 my youngest was 10 at that time and they all had them at 5 and under. At times of high stress the shingles come back and I have nerve damage in a spot on my back from them. It sucks. Lol Evwryone who is wondering why people are getting shingles younger and younger it is the result of the cp vaccine. CP is a virus that stays in your system. Every time you are exposed to the virus its like receiving a booster shot. This is why shingles used to be an older persons illness. The elderly are not exposed to the virus as often because they generally were not around younger kids as much. Since kids are getting the vaccine none of us are being reexposed to the cp virus therefore we are getting shingles younger and younger.
10637,31 Male Canada 183 cm 190 lbs Existing Conditions Chron's Disease 2011 Current Medications Humira weekly since 2014 Personal Vegetarian since birth nonsmokernondrinker In November of 2023 I got Shingles. I recovered from Shingles and felt a bit of post Shingles pain. In the last 2 weeks i.e. June 2024 I have started to experience strange symptoms pins and needles everywhere in my body hands feet legs face chest comes and goes prickly feelings burning feelings a strange itch between the shoulder blades coming from under the skin occasional twitch in the legs occasional tightness in the right side of the stomach sometimes a vein in the right thigh will become more pronounced stiffnesstiredness in the neck and arm I do NOT have double vision I do NOT have shortness of breathdifficulty breathing I do NOT have any mobility problems I do NOT have a decrease in appetite I do NOT feel dizzy I have NOT lost sensation or feeling in any part of my body I have NO slurred speech My balance has NOT been affected I tried the Romberg Balance test several times and I can balance just fine I DO NOT have any symptoms of increasesinconsistent urination I DO NOT feel any brainmemory fog I DO NOT feel any general exhaustion tiredness or fatigue just stressanxiety because of the symptoms I am experiencing All these symptoms come and ago but have been lingering for the last 2 weeks. I showed to a doctor this week July 2024 and got some blood work back. In the blood work I found out that I am severely lacking in Iron Ferritin 3 . Essentially I was told that by my doctor that my Iron is the lowest he has ever seen and its virtually 0. My hemoglobin is 120 WBC is 6.6 and RBC is 5.33 Blood sugar is also fine . I do NOT have symptoms of Diabetes I am lacking in Vitamin D ... my value was 41 it should be between 75 and 250 . Since my blood test I have started taking Vitamin D supplements regularly Even though I am a vegetarian I eat eggs and milk I am not lacking in B12 I actually have a value of 854 when the max should be 652 Currently my doctor thinks that the symptoms I am experiencing is because of Iron based Anemia and has scheduled for me to get iron infusions. Even though I have been taking iron supplements for the past few months the doctor thinks that because of my Chron's I might not be absorbing Iron properly. The doctor wants to see if taking the iron infusions will improve these symptoms. I am currently waiting to hear back from the infusion center to start these treatments. I am just looking for a second opinion from the online community. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms before? What were you diagnosed with in the end? Thanks PS I have experienced strong migraine headaches on and off for the last 10 years.
10642,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Really nice blast from the past Great seeing all of the cars and the memories they brought back On an extremely serious note.. Get you shingles shots. I am 56 and have had shingles for many years. It was horrible and put me in the hospital multiple times. Since getting my shots at 50 the pain itch burning out break size and duration have ALL been drastically reduced. Instead of weeks of anguish it has been reduced to 1 week total time from outbreak to healing.
10644,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: My mother had two csections and never took a pain killer. She set her own nose when it was broken. She does not feel pain. Except she was in agony with a shingle. I got the vaccine as soon as I was eligible. Go for my second dose in March.
10647,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had shingles at 50. My god the misery. It was on my face near my eye. I still have no feeling in the eyebrow.
10648,I got shingles form last week and in 1st photo they are become dry but i am still itchy in other place like chest and arm and still appeared folliculitis like in 2nd photo in my chest .it is normal to keep getting new shingles even old shingles are dry?: i think it a shingles too.My first shingles appear on my leg is like this and it not itchy like you too.But if i have touch it feel hot and hurt.5 day later it becomer spread on me.The new spread born shingles are itchy on me.YOU should see doctor dude.
10650,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Skepticism by whom exactly? You Are conflating a delivery method with an immune response and blaming the result of the immune response on the delivery method hence why your point is not a point at all. Its demonstrable nonsense. This really is not that complicated.
10651,Second Shingles Shot: I am just getting over Shingles I got it on my left eye face and scalp. I am only 45 it is no joke I am wondering if I should get the shots to prevent it from coming back? Has anyone gotten their shots after getting Shingles?
10655,Shingles vaccine: About 13 of us will have shingles in our lifetime Shingrix decreases risk by over 90 Check your local county health department as many offer vaccines for free both my wife and I had shingrix series no side effects
10659,I recently got my COVID vaccine and unfortunately had a bad reaction to it. It's important to be aware of the potential side effects and to seek help if you experience any unusual symptoms. Stay informed and take care of your health.
10666,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: Yes It only affects 1020 of people in their eye Somehow I was the lucky one. It was AWFUL. My eye was swollen shut for a few days and I was in the hospital twice Extreme light sensitivity it even affected my sense of balance. I started with headaches omg the headache was severe I do not get shooting nerve pain anymore. Now I am just dealing with the neuropathic itching. I am on Gabapentin for that. But having it in my eye was the biggest health scare of my life Thankfully my vision was never affected. I think it is a miracle that I am OK considering how bad I looked. I was lucky that the one nurse at academy diagnosed me early otherwise it could have ended much worse for me Having Shingles on your face is the most dangerous place for it to be.
10667,I going today for my new Covid booster and flu shot. Two weeks out I am getting the shingles vaccine I usually feel tired for a day but that is it. I also have not had Covid. I have not had the flu ever since I started getting the vaccine every year. Science man it is cool.
10668,Same except for me it was the second dose of the shingles vaccine. I did okay with the first one.
10669,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Whenever I heard about the chicken pox play dates the children were at least 4. Never babies. Babies cannot handle that discomfort. And imagine locking a baby you have to prevent from scratching so they do not scar themselves in a car. Police and lawyer are needed so bad. Sure chicken pox does not kill you but you should not have to go through it. There Is no NEED to go through it. And it opens you up to shingles and you never know where it will be. My mom had it on a spit on her back that is basically a cluster of nerves so it was awful for her. A coworker of mine knows someone who got shingles on their face and has most of their face scarred from it. That same coworker was talking about setting up chicken pox play dates for her grandson someday and how proud she is of her vaccine daughter
10670,RSV vaccine?: RSV is extremely scary in babies. If you have ever spoke to parents of a baby that had it and had to be hospitalized its no joke so if something can keep your little one from getting sick from it totally worth it. I just gave it to my 6 month old last week. No side effects. I Have given all the routine things up until now including influenza as well.
10676,Shingles vaccine experience: I had zero reaction for either shot. Do Not tense up. Relax the shot area completely prior to the getting the shot.
10677,my vaccine family members got shingles younger than me and it is the only vaccine they will get now that is how bad it is
10678,"""Unusual skin reaction post Covid booster?: I recently received my Covid and flu shots, and now I'm experiencing a strange rash in the same spot where I had shingles before. Has anyone else had a similar reaction after getting vaccinated?"""
10681,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: I had shingles once. Mild case but incredibly painful. From the pain management point of view...I tried various standard pain killers and novocaine patches. Nothing worked. Did some research and learned that those pain killers do not work on the same pain receptors those meds act on Advil etc. but THCCBD does. I tried a tincture of 11 and it worked My understanding is that it is Important to have both as they act together. On a scale of 010 it the pain went from 8 to a 3. I could still feel it but it was low enough it just became background noise that I could ignore. I started off with a low dose and worked up from there to find what worked for me.
10683,I got the first two then got Covid and shingles 43yo that year then have not got a booster since and have not been sick since.
10684,Rinvoqacneshingles: Yes i got it a few months prior to being switched to RINVOQ. Maybe 23 months before starting? I ended up switching to skyrizi after 60 days on RINVOQ because my blood work was crazy. My neutrophils were so low I could not fight infections and was hospitalized for strep for 10 days. I hope it works better for you It was nice not having to give myself shots. Have you taken skyrizi? If not It might be worth the research it has great remission statistics for those who have failed multiple other biologics best of luck
10686,Shingles vaccine experience: I felt shitty for both doses exhausted achy and feverish. But it was only a couple of days. I have known a few people with shingles over the years and even my worst day did not approach that. It is miserable. You made the right choice. And BY THE WAY I know someone who did not just end up with shingles in her eyes it got into her optic nerve and into her brain. She has all kinds of cognitive problems from it now.
10687,Its crazy how people are so different in reactions. I had my 2nd Shingles shot and my flu shot in the same arm on the same day a few years ago and no reaction at all. One of my coworkers had a worse reaction to his 2nd Shingles shot than his first.
10688,"""Second shot dilemma after shingles post first dose: After developing shingles 10 days following my first Pfizer shot 15 weeks ago, it took me around 5 weeks to recover from the outbreak. Now, I'm unsure about getting the second dose as I'm worried about experiencing shingles again. Has anyone faced a similar situation and proceeded with the second shot? How did it go for you?"""
10693,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: The same symptoms as the first shot. And they were bad. But still better than shingles Shingles do not play
10697,Just a rant . My 17 month old son has been sick for a month . Double ear infections new unknown allergens including milk just constant tummy issues and whole body eczema rash . Well I have not been this stressed in years with not knowing how to help him . Just doctor appointmentsblood work trial and week with foods. So yeah yay small out break on my right inner thigh. Should had known from the severe headaches three days prior and a horrible kink in my neck . I Am just going to bandage it up put some ointment on it and let it run its coarse. Plus keep taking vitamins . Have Not slept this much in awhile. I do not have insurance I had to go part time after having my son and lost my insurance. so I Am not even going to bother to try to get Valaciclovir. Luckily its always been mild for me. My son had his first chickenpox vaccine so he should be okay . Ill still keep it bandaged up and wash all our bedding
10700,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I did I am immunosuppressive and had to be in the ICU because I got shingles really bad on my face and in my mouth. I got permission from my doctor because I am under 50. I do not want to have to go through that pain again. It was horrible so yes I got the shot after.
10704,I just turned 62have had 2 boosters on top of the initialvaccines had Covid twice. No biggie at all I felt worse after my shingles vaccine than I ever felt w Covid.
10707,Shingles vaccine: I got my shingles shot sore arm no more than any other shot. I have known more than a handful of people that got shingles and were miserable for years. Definitely worth getting over my fear of shots for.
10708,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick after any of my shingles vaccines. My arm hurt but not sick.
10713,Do any of you know this? This year it is adrenaline dumps. It started in the middle of the night in May without any warning just popped there and did not go away. I have been through another medical marathon since May and luckily found a doctor who is open to wanting to help me. Everyone else there are now 15 of them are overwhelmed and do not want to help. If it was the first year it would be one thing. But every year something is different. For example In 2023 I had shingles a total of 9 times. In 2022 I had some type of nerve inflammation in my back 6 times. In 2021 the Corona vaccination completely paralyzed me and the extreme fatigue began. In 2019 I had a cold all the time from March to September without a day off. In 2017 I gained 30kg which I still cannot lose again no matter how little I eat and how much exercise I do. 2016 stabbing pain behind the eyes. In 2015 the soles of my feet burned so that I could not walk more than 100m at a time. Extreme hair loss started in 2014 and cost me 23 of my hair. Some symptoms stay for a few months some for a few years and then as suddenly as they came they simply went away. And it is so annoying that I cannot do anything about it. No matter what I try it does not help. I have to get through this and hope that it just goes away at some point. I now know the causes but it does not stop no matter what I do. This year has pissed me off so much again I was actually doing quite well until these adrenaline dumps suddenly woke me up. And despite medication I notice that the adrenaline dumps are still lurking and have not gone away. I honestly do not know how much longer I can stand this. It is been like this since I was 19 I am now 35 and I just do not see an end to it.
10717,"Just got my flu shot as a precaution against getting sick this winter. I'm 34 and have a toddler at home, so staying healthy is a top priority for me. However, I experienced some unexpected side effects after the vaccination. I had a headache and felt fatigued for a couple of days, which made it hard for me to keep up with my usual routine. Despite the temporary discomfort, I know that getting the flu shot was the right choice for me and my family."
10718,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Same with my husband it was on his head and in his eye. Just awful he turned 50 this year so he got the vaccine.
10721,Guy in grocery store does not want a free flu shot: Shingles is the third worst shot I have gotten. Second was yellow fever. When I was on my ship I told everyone who had to get it you will get sick fever body aches. I also relieved them from duty the next day to be safe otherwise they will show up to sick call complaining of the same symptoms I warned them about Worst of all was Anthrax. It is injected into the skin tissue not in the muscle so you really did not feel much. You would feel fine for 30 seconds then you would get this BURNING sensation down your arm. I had to tell people to wait before leaving so they did not hurt themselves going down stairs or anything when it kicked in. I could almost time it 3...2...1...
10727,Got the Shingles vaccine for Rinvoqhere is what happened: It obviously is a possible way for it to go but getting the vaccine can also be no problem at all. When I got the two shots only thing I ever felt was a little soreness at the injection site for a few hours. And I have had bad reactions like you to vaccines before. Vaccine response is incredibly individual and having had shingles Id recommend this to most everyone. Just make sure you get Shingrix nonlive version if you are on or soon starting any kind of immunosuppressive medication.
10730,Yes the shingles vaccine will probably knock you on your ass for a day or two 36 hours for me. But my construction worker grandfather had a brain aneurysm that made him vomit from pain and light and he said shingles was the worst most painful thing that ever happened to him.
10733,I recently found out about this it was October this year 2024  doctor gave me a surgical treatment and the warts were removed. I was suggested to apply the imikeraderm which gave me redness on the spot so I could not used it as recommended and after two months the warts appeared again and recently I had another surgical treatment. Now my doctor asked me to go for laser treatment. I also had two doses of the vaccine gardasil9. It seems like getting better but since doctor asked me to go for further checkup and laser treatmentnow I am worried if there is anything more serious. 
10735,Issues after vaccines in babies with food sensitivity?: So sorry your little one is experiencing this. My little one has multiple food sensitivities and I Have been on elimination diet with no dairy soy egg or corn. She did totally fine with her 2mo  4mo vaccines and we just got RSV antibodies at 5mo 2 weeks ago. Thankfully no issues but I Am so sorry your little one is experiencing that.
10737,"Is it in my head?: I had shingles in my eye and had to be off work for 2.5 months. I had lots of dizzyness and weakness. I was unable to do much at all in that time. It was about 6 months before I started to feel like myself. While I no longer have pain, I do have some nerve damage in my face, and even after 3 years when I get stressed that part of my face gets itchy and irritated."
10738,"Reacting to the shingles vaccine before starting a biologic: I'm scheduled to begin my Humira treatment in a week, and my doctor advised me to get both the shingles and extra pneumonia vaccines beforehand. I received the shingles vaccine yesterday, and as warned by my doctor, I am feeling absolutely dreadful. The pain and discomfort have triggered one of the most severe flares I've ever experienced. I'm dreading the thought of having to go through this ordeal again in two months for the second shot of the vaccine. Fingers crossed that the pneumonia vaccine doesn't hit me as hard as this one did. Hoping for some relief soon, as this is truly unbearable."
10744,The areas on my elbow started about a month ago and come and go. They start out as little teeny bumps that sometimes itch and burn and then they flake off. Then come back. The first photo is something that cropped up on the posterior wrist two or three days ago with little fluid filled patches that break open and scab. I have not noticed any other areas like this. I did have my shingles vaccine although they were about two years apart unfortunately. I do have SLE I do not know if that matters. AM I dealing with two separate things? And what are they potentially? I have an appointment at the end of October and cannot get to my rheumatologist until then.
10745,I used to get a flu shot every year religiously. Never again they will likely throw the COVID poison in every vaccine I got 2 serious cases of shingles and still will not get that vaccine either. Never again.
10746,Shingles vaccine: I feel you on the flucovid vaccine and always feel like crap the next morning for about 1214 hours. Having the flu or covid involves feeling so much worse for so much longer. My brother got shingles recently and after hearing his experience I got my shingles vaccine scheduled right away. Whatever discomfort sideeffects are instore I know it will pail in comparison to having it.
10749,26F 52 100lbs Dxs SLE POTS Asthma Hi I have a question. A little over a week ago I woke up with a rash on my face near my left eye. A few days later I went to my dermatologist and he said it was shingles. He did a skin culture to make sure but prescribed valtrex and gabapentin. I Am shocked by the diagnosis though because I had the chickenpox vaccine and even confirmed with my parents that I never had chickenpox growing up. I will mention that throughout the month of May I had a pretty bad flare up of my lupus and was on a prednisone taper. I Am on plaquenil benlysta infusions corlanor and colchicine. I know my immune system is very suppressed but at 26 years old I never expected to have shingles and I Am very confused on as to how I have it. The rash is healing well but the pain was brutal and now I Am just trying to understand how this happened.
10754,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles at 22 on my left shoulder. It was very painful but thank god I was young cuz I remember going camping and to concerts while in the pain. Dr diagnosed it just as it was clearing up.
10755,My mother in law got the covid vaccine in 2021 or 2022. I cannot recall exactly when she got it but she definitely did. She got shingles 6 months ago and she is still suffering from nerve damage it gave her. I have no idea if there is any connection but this is what happened.
10756,Shingles Vaccine: Get it. I have had shingles 3X you DO NOT want them. First two times were so and ouch inside forearm and spot on ribs felt like a blowtorch when it woke me up at 1 am but Capsaicin HP fixed it 3rd time I burned my last week of vacation that year '21 and was taking 24003600 mg. of gabapentin my PCP recommended that dosage he was right and hanging over the arm of my recliner listening to podcasts between naps lol. I had huge blisters from the midline of my front to the midline of my back. I am still taking anywhere from 1200 2400 mg. of gabapentin every day for post herpetic neuralgia in the one spot on my back that was the worst blister. That is AFTER a steroid epidural and trigger point injections that did nothing but because more pain. Please consider getting it. I tell everyone who is over 50 to get it. Shingles SUCK
10758,Long Covid and Neuropathy Shingles at 32 years old: I asked them for the vaccine in March when I got my medicaid finally and then they told me no the FDA only approves it for 50 and 19 with immune issues aka me and then within 2 months I had shingles. and I have had shingles since late May. It sucks because I already have so many issues from the long covid from the EDS the migraines etc that I am spiraling real bad this weekend and lashing out at friend's of friend's who are not being safe and I just feel like I am losing my mind. No one will listen to me Doctors cannot help me I just get to live the rest of my life in pain
10761,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it in my 30's. Luckily like you it was one weird patch on my arm. The doc explained that when it flares up it usually only targets one section of nerves... unfortunately it is a total tossup as to where that patch might be.
10764,Shingles Sucks: my shingles never showed a rash just the pain alternating between front and back of my ribcage. The prednisone made it SO MUCH WORSE. Apparently steroids plus shingles equals BAD in my case. keep an eye on your pain levels when taking the steroid. if it starts to get really bad stop taking them and go see the doc as soon as possible.
10765,Shingles vaccine experience: Same here. Hardly any side effects except a sore shoulder. On the other hand a close friend just got shingles and she was suffering for a month.
10766,Shingles exposure?: I Have had shingles 37f and it is tremendously painful and takes a while to fully get over. Leave food for your mom at the door and protect yourself. You Are never really on a break from IVF. Keep yourself healthy.
10768,Hello all. I am 34F and pregnant with my first child at 364. Med history of POTS. HG in the beginning of pregnancy. They were worried about preeclampsia a couple of weeks ago but my BP stabilized. No other medications at this time. I received my TDap vaccine on Thursday and when I asked about other necessary vaccines was told RSV whenever and fluCovid in the fall. I am about to begin a course of valtrex as a preventative measure I get cold sores on my face sometimes and obviously now would be a bad time. I am no doctor but my understanding is that an antiviral can impede my ability to develop immunity? Anyway as someone who got very ill in 2022 because of COVID and ended up with long COVID and someone who values getting her vaccines timely and especially so with a baby on the way would it be wise to 1. Get my RSV and COVID vaccines tomorrow at CVS figuring I would rather get a booster and some protection because I have no idea when Pfizer is coming out with the next one sometime in August seems vague. 2. Begin the valtrex midweek. This one i do not know I want to give my body enough time to develop antibodies. Is this a fine way to proceed?
10770,"Taking antiviral meds and Covid vaccine interactions?: Hi all, i got my COVID vaccine yesterday morning and officially got diagnosed with shingles today. I wouldn't have gotten my vaccine but I really just thought I had bug bites or something ??. I'm starting the antiviral meds today....anyone know if it will make the vaccine less effective or anything like that? The nurse I saw at the urgent care wasn't too much help and couldn't give much advice to be honest...."
10773,Shingles vaccine experience: I had no bad effects from either Shingrix vaccine so its very possible.
10774,2 month vaccines and RSV: We did RSV shot one week earlier than my babys 2 month appointment. She cried for a few seconds and was totally normal the rest of the day. I was also on the fence about doing it alone early or all at once but if I did not get her the shot early and then she somehow caught RSV in the next week I would regret that
10776,First time shingles: You are so welcome. I am always happy to help after that nightmare. I will try to answer your questions. Let me know if I did not answer one. 1. My itching started on Day 16 immediately after my pain subsided. My shingles were all over my scalp 12 of my forehead my eyebrow and my eyelid. I messaged my doctor on My Chart and she called me back. The itching drove me crazy. It was like a neuropathic itching. It was like you could not reach the itching because everything is numb. My doctor saved me with hydroxyzine. It definitely works. It makes you very sleepy though. 2. I put the ice pack on mainly my left ear and left side of my neck. I Have never been in that much pain. My labor pains were not as bad as the shingles pain. It was like someone had a HAMMER and was pounding me. I cried and cried. My young adult children probably filled my ice pack every two hours. The ice pack helped tremendously. 3. My doctor did prescribe a pain pill. I do not like pain pills but I could not have made it without a pain pill. I took them for about a week. 4. Yes I could not have made it without the Aspercream Lidocaine spray. I went through 3 cans. True story 5. My severe pain lasted until Day 15 with Day 1 being the appearance of the first blister. Day 16 on I had severe itching. I cannot see your comments now for some reason. Text me back if you have any more questions. So happy I could help
10784,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: My wife is just hitting 46. Last year at 45. She had an outbreak of shingles. It was absolutely horrible for her. We could not sleep in the same bed she was tossing and turning. and then I also caught C covid so that did not help either. it is ABSOLUTE BS that we cannot get the Shingles Vaccine until 50. Especially with more and more cases of it hitting adults in their mid to late 40's.
10787,Put me out of my misery.: I had shingles in my eye socket. one of the worst experiences of my life. I still have scar tissue on my face from it. I promise the vaccine is not nearly as bad
10788,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: I just finished my Shingles series too. Had a little bump under my skin for a couple of weeks. I saw my mom have Shingles and I definitely do not want that.
10790,Pervistop or AHCC?  money is not a problem can someone suggest me a good supplement to clear hpv 16: Do you work for the vaccine company? Lololol I got the vaccine and still got hpv. Its not full proof.
10797,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was forcibly infected and I also had shingles in my 20s. I had lasting nerve damage from it.
10799,I Am 22 years old and this my second time having shingles. First time in September 2021. I Am healthy and active but my immune system is ass and I have high levels of anxiety and stress constantly that combination is what I believe to be the because of my shingles. I just started noticing symptoms painsensitivity in my right arm down to my palm sensitive skin to the touch and I noticed I got the rash in the exact same spot as I did years ago. I hope its not as bad as last time.
10801,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: Do Not feel bad Its ok to ask questions for your own clarification. For what its worth we are very vaccine but were thrown for a loop in the NICU with the shot schedule mixed in with everything else. Our son absolutely was not going to leave without his vaccines esp RSV but we did ask to move some shots around by a few days so he was not going through too many stressful things at once eg a bed move shots etc eye exam. To be clear if it was a choice between vaccine or not we would choose vaccine every time but the NICU was very supportive of some minor timing adjustments.
10803,"56 yo female - rash after 2nd Pfizer shot: I developed a rash on my arm about a week after receiving my second Pfizer shot. It was itchy and uncomfortable, but thankfully not too severe. The rash lasted for about four weeks before finally fading away. It was a strange reaction, but I'm glad it wasn't anything more serious. Plus, I saved some money on not having to buy new long-sleeved tops to cover it up!"
10804,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Iv had shingles twice and it is brutal. Serves her right
10805,Hi all I got Abrysvothe maternal RSV vaccine when I was pregnant with my son. He just tested positive for RSV hell be five months tomorrow. Hes honestly taking it like a champ and sounds better than he did when he had his first cold at 10 weeks however I Am still freaking out. Hes already on day 2 or 3 of being sick. Just looking for stories from other parents who got the RSV vaccine and had a baby catch it anyways I just came out of the thick of PPA and need some reassurance
10806,Shingles Sucks: I had it in my forehead and oooooh yes it sucked. The worst headache ever. Nonstop for weeks.
10807,Chickenpox as an adult: yes i guess i did not ask my question right. i know all of that but i guess i am wondering if the pain is the same. shingles was unbearably painful and itchy i know chickpox is itchy but it is painful too?
10808,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: My daughter had the vaccine at 4 weeks old. My son had rsv when she was about 12 weeks and she never developed any symptoms
10815,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: Thankfully had no issues with either shingles shot.
10817,I did not have a reaction to either shingles shot. Different for everyone. Husband had tough time and lots of friends said second shot is even worse. Nothing thankfully.
10820,More evidence of a failing immune system: Both COVID and the COVID vaccine have both been found to have effects on peoples' immunity to herpes type viruses. COVID made my old Mono infection resurface. I have also had 3 shingles outbreaks since then.
10823,Shingles Vaccine: Get the vaccine. Shingles is way worse. I ended up with shingles on the side of my face. It was like hot knitting needles stabbing me in the roots of my teeth the while time. It also damaged my hearing on that side because it went in my ear.
10824,Shingles and GenX: I was really young too... like late 30s and it took them a minute to figure out what it was... it was so painful on top of feeling like I had the flu so maybe it was the combo of that making me want to die... lol
10827,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had chickenpox as a kid and got shingles at 27. My wife got it too a few years later at 36. She Is 84 and I Am 90. We both had chickenpox as kids. Shingles fucking SUUUUUCKS. Neither of us Got sick with a fever like you do with chickenpox but it feels like being burned with electricity where the rash is. This is what people with genital herpes deal with It hurts so bad my poor wife had it on her boob I had it on my stomach. Fwiw we are both women.
10828,Last Covid 2022 4th shot Got RSV Flu Pneumonia Shingles 92023. No Covid. Getting no vaccines this year. Our kids are getting more sick not more well. My Boomer body is much stronger than younger snowflakes.
10829,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yup its the worst and the first one took a few days second one was fine though Was not expecting that. Def better than getting it in your eye like my uncle who takes gabapentin every day since horrible
10831,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Currently dealing with shingles 29F because my mom forced me and my siblings to be around our chickenpox infected sibling so we all would get it at once. It is as painful as its said to be. Really hoping I caught it early enough so that this antiviral lessens the impact. Mine was possibly triggered by a thyroidectomy and the thyroid hormone they put me one afterwards. So not only am I recovering from surgery I Am dealing with oozing blisters that are painful on my forehead and hairline. Its miserable.
10832,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I did this shingles around the eye at 27. Thought it was a brain tumor. I Have had to have kidney stones fished out and shingles was worse. I need to ask my doctor if I need to vaccinate after having it early on.
10836,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: 47 and the first time I was 32 lost my hearing in my left ear. I have had it now a total of 3 times and insurance still will not cover the shot.
10838,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I hear she bombed so badly they added an e to the end of the improv sign
10839,I experienced about 12 hours of aches chills and overall feverish feeling. Then I was fine. Ill take that any day over months or more of pain and suffering from Shingles.
10843,"Herpes Zoster Vaccination: If you have already had chicken pox and shingles, is the herpes zoster vaccination still useful? Or does it only work if you have it before contracting the virus?"
10849,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Thank you for sharing. I did not get any information regarding risks of the vaccine but then again I did not have any health issues prior that it should have been a concern. Looking through this sub I see it does not seem to be uncommon getting shingles after the covid shot. I still feel conflicted about getting it where I live country in northern Europe there was no lockdown and having young kids going to school there was no way to protect yourself from getting it. I eventually got covid for the first time a few weeks after getting diagnosed with shingles and got pretty sick difficulty breathing and so on. I do not know if i would have survived if I was unvaccinated considering my body was already busy fighting this other terrible virus. I do wish the risks of all vaccinations was something that was talked about more. The fear of possibly infecting others has been a nightmare for me too cannot imagine having an infant and going through that. Hope you are doing better now.
10856,Shingles vaccine: Get the Shingrix vaccine. You do not want shingles. I Have had it twice in my 60s.
10857,Shingles with PHN after: I Am in my fifth week and still have scabs in my head most of my neck its clear but still a couple that giving me electric shocks also my ear got bad and still very sensitive. I been on800mlg of gabapentin and its helping but really slow I Am staring on lyrica tomorrow hopefully it helps its my first time and hopefully the last one .
10858,"Should I (52M) get vaccinated for chickenpox and shingles?: you can get a blood test to see if you're immune to chicken pox through infection/previous vax. If you're immune - get the shingles vaccine. If you're not - talk to your doctor about whether you should get the chicken pox or shingles vaccine, more info would be needed to decide."
10860,Rinvoq and Shingles: I was also in a very bad flare up when I started Rinvoq. But still I have to had 2 shots. I was on max. with pain killers and on a high dose of prednisonbut here in central europe they take the guidelines very seriously. Here health insurance and rheumatologist society demand 2 shots. I had to sign a paper about this topic.
10861,Shingles vaccine: Do not recall it being any worse than the flu shot. My mom got shingles and developed Bell's palsy and a lot of complications. It is nothing to take lightly.
10864,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I got shingles when I was 17. Trust me. Get the shot. it is worth it. I ended in horrible pain with sores on my face for 2 weeks
10865,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I got my 1st shot exactly one day after my 50 th birthday. Those shingles commercials scared T F out of me
10867,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I am only 33 BUT I got it as a teenager. I STILL got HPV somehow. It went away but it is so annoying that is happened z
10868,Getting the AstraZeneca vaccine after recovering from a sprained ankle. Hoping my body can handle the vaccine despite still feeling a bit sore. Has anyone else had to navigate a vaccine while dealing with a recent injury?
10869,Shingles vaccine: I got my two shingles vaccines. No side effects and my arm was barely sore. Beats getting the shingles I too paid out of pocket but its worth it.
10870,Apologizing in advanced for spelling or this post being all over the place. I Am Dyslexic I F23 got diagnosed with POTS primary type that we know of this year after 11 years of symptoms and BEGGING doctors for help. Finally got to a cardiologist who kind of knows about POTS. Despite being put on Bisoprolol and trying the average symptom management methods I Am still struggling with pre syncope bad brain fog 0 energy memory problems migraine with auras and other autonomic problems. Not to mention I Am just recovering from getting shingles I know at 23 I Am so lucky and ever since that all the symptoms are worse. So I was reading for days trying to find doctors who could help me in my province a specialist. There were only 2 cardiologists and so I booked an appointment with my doctor to try and get a referral to this dysautonomia clinic. Finally get a call back and REJECTED About 2.5 years ago I was also diagnosed with ADHD and have been prescribed Vyvanse. So I can understand why on paper the doctor rejected me. Vyvanse does increase the heart rate but I have been tracking my HR for about 4 years now and I would have still qualified for the diagnosis before I started the medication. Not to mention the 11 years of the symptoms and attempts to figure out what is wrong I guess I was just hoping to get enough compassion to at least hear me out. My problem now is I do not know what to do. How does one decide which one to treat? I get such bad fatigue brain fog and adhd symptoms that the Vyvanse is the only thing that helps me get ready for work and be able to function at my job. But if I want to get specialized care I Am assuming I would need to get off of the medication and submit another referral maybe even another holter monitor and echocardiogram which could take months to a year without the treatment of my other problems. Anyone got some advice? Been in this situation? Or here is a shot in the dark anyone from Ontario GTA that has a doctor who is educated on POTS and understands complex treatment around other conditions?
10871,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles at 20 and 28. My brother had it at 23 and was in the hospital for a week as it was in his eye and the pain was making him hallucinate.
10872,Oh man the shingles shot is the worst
10873,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Oof that is a kick in the nads. For real though shingles is a torturous experience. Had it a few years ago and I still have weird nerve pain in the area of the rash. would have thought I was safe from it bc I had chicken pox as a kid but apparently stress can make you susceptible as well. 35M
10882,Shingles and other Vaccines: I had both shingles shots 8 years later got a very mild case1 lesion Dr reminded me vaccine lessens does not delete disease.
10884,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Coconut hit hard Rattled brain box are not funny. Probably saw stars.
10886,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Man be glad you are getting this shot and whatever side effects it give you. I had an attack of shingles at age 24 thirty years ago because I was doing a super stressful job at that time. I got antiviral medication on day one of symptoms and my case was only a quartersized area of little blisters on my ribs on one side. The pain was absolutely debilitating and that was just the standard all day pain. There were additional waves of pain that came at random intervals and lasted for random lengths of time...sometimes 10 seconds sometimes 10 minutes and those extralevel pains were like being stabbed with a redhot dagger that someone then ran electricity through and pored acid on. I am going to get the shots this year and while I am reticent about the side effects I never ever want to get shingles again. Ever.
10887,Diagnosed with HPV I Am a virgin who has not had any sexual contact: after getting the 3 Gardasil shots as a child I was diagnosed with high risk cin 1  cin2 got a leep 2 months ago. Should I ask for One vaccine of Gardasil 9 to cover other strains not covered by the Original Gardasil vaccine?
10888,My pulmonologist has had me on 2 different Biologic medications and I am now starting my 3rd. Fasenra was the first and everything was going fine until Spring and it just was not helping me at all anymore. The second was Dupixent side effects were horrible and I tried to take other medications to remedy those side effects. But the Dupixent made me feel almost human again I loved feeling better with no asthma attacks and very few flare ups from my COPD. Now I Am on Nucala and I took my first injection 2 days ago and so far so good. I have felt a little more run down and I Have had trouble sleeping but the worst of the side effects is possible break out of Shingles. I immediately went to my pharmacy and got the shingles vaccine. My question is if you are on Nucala what has your experience been with it? Side effects? Do you feel so much better?
10889,I Have been on the shot for 11 years now. No issues at all including any bone mineral density effects. Since day 1 I never had a period. However I Have been bleeding and cramping excessively near my next injection appointment date these last 2 rounds. Last time I was at 11 weeks I go every 12 weeks but have gone 15 weeks previously with no issues and began bleedingcrampingsevere mood swings. I got my shot 2 days later so about a half week early and everything went right back to normal. I upped my dose of modafinil which I thought contributed to me metabolizing my shot faster because its a CYP3A4 enzyme inducer. I stopped that medication immediately when I noticed the bleeding as I was aware that could happen. But now I Am only at 9 weeks and have started bleeding and cramping again. Thankfully no mood swings as of yet but it seems far too early my next injection is not for another 3 weeks. I do have shingles and am taking antivirals right now but valacyclovir does not affect the P450 enzymes at all so now I do not know. Over the last year I have switched to the prefilled syringes because the vials have been discontinued I believe they repurposed their warehouse to make Covid vaccine vials instead of depoprovera vials. Wondering if anyone else has been having issues with their last few injections lately..? Especially regarding it wearing off faster than usual? I am aware of the many horror stories of depo provera and know of all the risks bone mineral density loss sterilization weight gain depression etc. but it has been a god send for me. I remember taking T4s opioid medication when I was 13 during my periods being in such extreme pain. But after trialing a dozen birth control pills depo worked the best. So I Am looking for any observations from people who have been on it for a while at least a couple years who can compare different lots over the last few months years. Thanks
10890,Shingles vaccine: Had my booster. Still getting shingles. Ymmv
10891,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I got the gardasil vaccine right when it came out after I had already had several bad paps several colposcopies and two cryosurgeries. My doctor said it does not hurt to see if it will make the virus leave. I Have never had a bad pap since.
10892,What did it feel like for you when you took your first dose?: How long did you have side effects for? I Am about a week in taking it for MECFS as well 4 yrs in and still get headaches but hoping they go away as my body gets used to the medicine.
10894,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Fun part is if you get shingles w complications like me. Got it last year when exposed to someone w chickenpox and developed in my eye and face. Complication is nerve involvement. Has been a year and a half of this hell. The MIL is an IDIOT. ETA Oh and because it is a complicated case cannot get shingles vaccine so live in fear of redeveloping as tends to come back in same areas.
10896,I Am currently getting treated for syphilis pencilin but 2 days after my first shots I started having discomfort down there. I noticed this open wound like spot near my vagina and some spots on the lips down there..My groin area is also very sore and puffyinflamed feeling. I also get shingles spot on my knee anytime I Am really stressed sick etc and that flared up too at the same time. I know shingles and hsv are herpes viruses so I had a feeling its hsv but I Am not sure
10899,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: I wasn t saying I had a reaction happening now or ever for that note From my shot two years ago. I was saying that it was something I d read learned about before I even had my shots almost 2 years ago. I learned about shingles being a potential effect bc I read everything I can before getting shots from the shot two years ago.
10900,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Because insurance will not cover it until you are 50. They already have it so I do not think the vaccine will help much but correct me if I Am wrong. Op probably did not think they could get shingles this young
10902,Vaccine Shingles aka Monkey Pox. Tons of my elderly clients have come down with shingles after getting the covid vaccine boosters but I have a feeling most of the extreme cases doctors are seeing in gay men is cuz of how the vaccine interacts with the gay 'prep' meds they are taking.
10904,Baby RSV Shot: Other than the immediate cry from the poke. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
10905,I have had shingles twice in college and several years later but I caught it early they have meds so my doctor had me get the 2 part vaccine. The second one was not so bad but the first one was crazy. Still it is better than the outcome of shingles.
10908,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got the RSV vaccine in my 32nd week of pregnancy and had my baby get her own shot at 6 months. She still got RSV at 8 months of age but it manifested as just a cold congestion and nothing more that would suggest a super scary virus. Our pediatrician said that it is a reminder that even vaccines do not prevent the catching of the disease they greatly ameliorate the symptoms even if a person catches it and our anecdotal experience certainly supports that view.
10911,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was a child in the late 60s early 70s and I have lots of cousins. If one of us got it especially in summer because no school the rest of us would be brought together with them to play for the day. To get it over with. I was ok but my sister has scars from the pox. I remember her having it on her feet and heels and she could not wear shoes for a long while. I suspect the practice of pox parties began even before my generation.
10912,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: I am so sorry. It does sound like Mnires. Too much salt s a big vertigo trigger for me and I take over the counter Meclizine when I feel like it might be coming on. I have gotten used to being deaf in one ear and the tinnitus with time.
10914,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: So got shingles in my ear about 20 years ago. That Is some pain right there. Luckily I did not end up with Bells Palsy which apparently can happen. 5 years ago my SiL friend got the Shingrix vaccine and immediately had liver failure also apparently a potentially rare side effect. So basically I Am scared in both directions. My Dr said do not stress as shingles is opportunistic and when you go through stressful times and you are run down it knows your body is depleted it strikes.
10915,I got the first single dose vaccine years ago no reaction. Then I got the 2 dose update no reaction. My father had shingles. You do not want that
10916,Shingles vaccine experience: I had zero effects from my shingles shots. But I also did not get any from Covid shots either.
10917,3.5 year old has chickenpox while we are on holiday in South Korea: Also from what my health visitor has told me it will be available on the NHS at some point. Not sure exactly when as they are working on the details of when best to schedule them. I got my son vaccinated at a year too. Yes it cost but its worth it if you can afford it and it is meant to possibly protect from shingles in the future.
10923,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox in the 1970s as a teenager. The illness was not super terrible the pox were itchy and I still have a number of scars from scratching them.
10925,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was born in 84 and my mom put me in the vaccine trial. I never had chicken pox.
10926,Shingles vaccine?: If you have strong reactions to vaccines I think you already have your answer. This shingles vaccine is new and it seems it may only be needed because they started giving kids the chicken pox vaccine. It used to be that if you had chicken pox you were not likely to get shingles later in life. But since they decided to start vaccinating for something that used to be a nonlife threatening temporary itchy hell rightofpassage illness the population is less exposed to chicken pox and therefore our natural immunity boosters from exposure have gone down and now were more likely to be susceptible to shingles. And now the pharmaceutical companies can make more money on yet another vaccine we never needed dispute the larger risk from administering it than the chicken pox ever presented. Oi. And here we are with RA which very well could have been triggered from other fun money making experiments they have conducted on us. What I know from Rheumatologists the COVID vaccine did a number on their patients. To trigger immune responses in already immunesupressed people is risky business. I have RA and narcolepsy google Pandemrix to see how GSCs flu vaccines caused a major triggering of Narcolepsy in Finnish and Swedish children. And never forget your body your choice
10927,I had shingles on my face. Pain was excruciating. The vaccine did not because much of a reaction. Definitely would rather feel bad for a couple of days than get shingles. It took months to feel better
10928,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: The pain ended up putting my grandmother in a nursing home then a fall and brain bleed killed her. She was constantly in and out of hospital and painkillers were not touching it so the Government Australia paid 2500 for a cream because it was cheaper than keeping her in hospital and paying for ambulance trips.
10930,I Am telling ya. Shingles does not give a fuck That vaccine was rough. Worth it but rough.
10932,: I had 5 vaccinated family members age 32 to 80 die in the last 3 years.. Washington State.. all got sick so rapidly and 2 were heart related and thrombosis.. including the 32 year old . 2 turbo cancer.. gone in less then a month.. its been horrible.. God bless the courage of you both I have never heard of died suddenly. I will look it up
10937,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: if you have an autoimmune disease and are taking an immunosuppressive drug then depending on what the drug is and how it works you may or may not mount as strong an immune response in response to the vaccine. My son has several autoimmune diseases and we gave him the HPV shot early because we were not sure if we would need to put him on a rheumatoid arthritis drug. So....that is another thing to consider.
10938,I did not have any reaction to the Shingles vaccine. Sorry to hear you did.
10942,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Shingles is an incredibly serious condition and if you have had chickenpox there is a very good chance you will end up developing it sometime in your life. My grandmother is suffering through it right now there is not a moment she is not in pain and it is directly destroying her eyesight. Chickenpox might not seem dangerous for children but shingles is a life threatening disease for an adult.
10944,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Oh you make my appendix ache.
10950,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I Have had shingles twice and got the vaccine 6 months after 2nd bout.
10952,"Gazebo wood/finishing: We've decided that we're going to build a gazebo. It will be mostly 2x6's with a shingled roof, 16'x16'. The problem is all my woodworking experience is with indoor projects so I dont know how wood reacts to the elements. I live in AZ. I'd like as little maintenance as possible. Should I spring for redwood? Do I have to finish it or does it hold up well unfinished? How often would I have to refinish Douglas fir?"
10957,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Despite being in my early 40s I Have had ocular shingles twice. You read that right I Have had SHINGLES IN MY EYEBALL. TWICE. And the second time was AFTER i got the shingles vaccine In my case there wereare special circumstances the Moderna brand covid vaccine and the infusion drug for my autoimmune disorder do not play nicely together so now I just stick to Pfizers version. But I would not have had to learn that the hard way if Id never fucking had chickenpox. I hope she divorces her husband and reports Trish to CPS. Grandparents can and do get barred from accessing their grandchildren and this in my opinion as a former foster care caseworker is enough for CPS to consider that option.
10958,shingles on cibinqo: I would rather take a few days of pain in my arm than a lifetime of nerve pain in my side. I had shingles last year. I never want them again. My side is permanently scarred and I have a persistent itch that never goes away there and cannot be satisfied. And if it is not itchy it is painful. The slightest touch will set off the nerve d is function. They could also come back and I would have to go through the burning pain all over again. Get the vaccine and save yourself the trouble.
10959,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chx pox as an infant. Had full blown shingles out break when i was 16
10960,Not sure if its just the meds or a combination of meds and general rubbish from shingles themselves but I feel markedly worse shortly after taking the Valacyclovir. Background Sunday I noticed a few red spots on my chest and thought it was maybe from my bra or a spider bite I live in Australia. Monday they were more red and started to notice some swelling and shocking pain in my shoulder and down my arm. Tuesday morning I had an appointment with my gp who prescribed Valaciclovir at a dose of 1000mg 3 times daily for 7 days. Its now Friday my rash has gotten worse and is in spots on my chest shoulder blade and back and down my arm. The pain has subsided a bit but is still definitely there and enough to make sleeping uncomfortable so I Am exhausted as it is. My main concern though is that whenever I take the medicine in about 3040 minutes I feel like garbage. I Am getting bouts of palpitations which I Have read can be a side effect and nausea. I have WPW Wolff Parkinsons White which means palpitations are kind of a regular occurrence for me so I can manage them reasonably well with some tricks I Have learned over time I guess I Am just hoping to hear others experience with the meds and if its also made them feel extra shit? So far I Have planned to take the remainder of this week off but since some of the blisters are on my arm unless they clear up quick smart I think Ill be taking more time off tattooer so cannot risk exposing anyone and wear short sleeves to work in Thanks in advance
10962,Would baby be more protected if I get the RSV vaccine 32 weeks pregnant or if she gets the monoclonal antibody injection during the next RSV season?: My toddler has RSV and its been terrible for him. He went to the ER on Monday for a breathing treatment and now has an ear infection and bronchitis. Fever on and off breathing problems not eating fussier than normal sleep issues. My 7 week old just has a cough and some congestion and even tested negative. I got the vaccine when I was 34 weeks pregnant.
10965,First 24 hours after dose: Peak serum levels are generally 3648 hours after you dose. That Is probably when you would feel itside effects the most. It is for me so I take my shot around 10am so I Am sleeping for most of the 3648 hour mark.
10966,Absolutely. I plan nothing for the day of and little for the day following just in case. The one that really laid me out was the shingles vaccine.
10968,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Also I find it interesting you also have crazy flare ups because some days I do not notice the pain and then one day Ill be brushing my teeth and collapse to the ground in blistering pain. Like what the fuck even is that?
10974,Vaccines: I got shingles above my left eye in August of 2023. I Am now 43. It was one of the most unpleasant experiences I Have ever had. What Is worse is I have post heretic neuralgia. That basically means I have had a phantom itch non stop ever since. Definitely get vaccinated.
10978,GI Issues after Covid vaccines or Covid infection. Interesting article I found.: I often wondered about this because I had mild constipation and never ever needed any laxatives. Now laxatives do not even work Now I Am severe Sorry to hear you developed those gi issues. I feel your frustration. I Am wondering if its that darn spike protein that was in our vaccines .? I Have done so much reading on the effects it has on our bodies. Thank god I stopped at the 2nd vaccine.
10983,Help  shinglelike rashes in pregnancies?: I wish I had something helpful for you. But trigger warning LC I had shingles around when my son was a year when I was 34 which is supposedly young for it. I have heard that it could have something to do with immune suppression in pregnancy and postpartum which would make sense. If you have had chickenpox and can get the S hring r ix vaccine I highly recommend it though I am not sure if it is indicated in pregnancy. I am in the US and paid out of pocket which was about 200. However Shingles is HORRIBLE. I have fi bro myalgia and am use to that but shingles was a whole not her level and the rash hurts like it is on fire. My blisters were more like eczema before they burst and they were not tiny. I do not understand how they diagnosed you with no testing. In any case I would be thinking autoimmune something. I hope you get more answers and that it means nothing.
10985,Doing great...kind of...just got a flu shot my first shingles shot. That shingles shot had some kick
10987,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: No joke. Get the vaccine. I did. I react poorly to vaccines. The Shingrix was fine. But shingles left a few friends with lasting problems. The vaccine was fine. It was two injections. Do not sleep on this.
10988,seriously what is up with in laws or grandparents in general thinking they have rights to your baby just because they are related? some background info my mom passed away when i was 19 and my dad lives in a different state so does my sister. i have no family in the state i live in at all. i have OCD pre pregnancy and ppa but i am dealing with it relatively well since birth. it was very bad in the beginning but i am doing MUCH better. i am actually happy now and have hard days like any mom does. my husbands stepmom who is divorced from his dad mom and dad all live relatively close by. i do not get along with his mom at all and his stepmom can be hit or miss. i have had two rules so far baby is 5m do not kiss her face handsfeet and do not post a picture of her face on social media. my MIL posted a pic of her face on facebook and now were not talking. my stepmother in law ? kissed her face hands and feet and i asked politely again to please kiss the top of her head etc. she started making passive aggressive comments and i just ignored it. fast forward to yesterday step MIL came over and was telling me that she is very concerned about me and how i am so negative and that is probably why i got shingles when i was 35 weeks pregnant. never mind working 40 hours a week at a stressful job. she kept making comments about how she is so worried about my happiness and was being very judgmental. she was framing it as if she was just so concerned for my wellbeing but it was not genuine at all. i ignored it for the whole visit. then toward the end of the visit she started talking about all of my rules and regulations that i have and how controlling i am how i do not prioritize family because my mom died ??? how my husband is going to resent me and how i am catatonic and a lunatic. she said a lot more but i was very taken aback and she was SCREAMING in front of my baby. it was horrible. i said you do not have rights to my baby just because you are family i am sorry i have boundaries that are healthy boundaries and also .. I AM THE MOM i can make rules for MY baby? also my controlling regulations are really not that insane of an ask .. do not kiss my baby and do not post a picture of her face. it was a horrible experience. she keeps bringing up how they were not allowed to come to the hospital and we have already resolved that. i had a VERY traumatic birth. they came to visit 2 weeks later and she kept bringing up how she wanted to have an intervention for me then because i was in a catatonic state i mean really???? i was fine like really going through it but nothing was dangerous. i was going to my doctors appts and started therapy right away. ftm and 2 weeks pp. even now i am 5m pp which is still fresh like give me a break. then she left saying she is done being a grandparent. just ranting and venting because i cannot stop thinking about it. my husband is on my side and was wfh at the time. he overheard and came out and tried to settle the conversation down but i was so shaken up i left the room with my baby. i just really do not understand how ANYONE thinks they have a right to your baby and feel like they do not have to respect boundaries. i wish my mom was here lol. EDIT ALSO they are always traveling to different countries and asking to come over 2 days after they get back which i allow but then get even more frustrated when they try to kiss her are all up in her face. like you just traveled out of country and multiple times they have ended up being sick from the travel a day or two after leaving our house. EDITX2 my husband did stand up for me in the moment told her stop told her she was wrong told her she was acting out of emotion and needed to stop etc. but i do agree he should also have a serious conversation with them when its not heat of the moment. hes had a horrible relationship with his mom his entire life and always stands up for me with her. i think yesterday with Step MIL he came into the conversation halfway through and was so taken aback by it because we have never gotten into it like that before so we do need to talk about how were going to move forward because we cannot allow that to happen again.
10989,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mum had it and suffered terribly. The only thing that helped was acupuncture. I have no idea what they did but she swears by it. I hope you get better soon.
10990,Shingles for the 2nd time forehead: Let us know the outcome of your trip. I bet its going to be better than you think stupid shingles. I Am 73 with my first shingles forehead also and in hair scalp never have I had something so awful. I Am feeling ya
10995,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I Have had shingles 3x. I did not know until recently I could get the shot. I get my 2nd shot in 2 weeks. Feeling crappy for a couple days is totally worth not going through shingles hell again
10997,Is the level of varicellazoster virus IgG associated with symptomatic status of genital herpes simplex virus infection? A casecontrol study  Bret S. Palmer Alan Tang Stephen Winchester Mark Atkins Simon Barton Peter Kelleher 2023: The vaccine caused the chronic OB s actually. I took it 3 times each time the OB s became more severe and painful. It induced weekly OB s for me. Never again.
11000,Fever chills severe headache this morning. Afraid that I am going to die. Feel so sick. Been taking the anti viral every 8 hours and a muscle relaxer every day but missed one dose. Had to take off work today. Also have an itch in my throat. Trying to rest. Can people die from shingles?
11002,"Just wanted to share my recent experience after receiving the Hepatitis A vaccine. A few days after getting vaccinated, I started experiencing extreme fatigue and muscle aches. Initially, I brushed it off as a normal reaction to the vaccine. However, the symptoms worsened and I ended up in the ER with concerns of a possible allergic reaction. After thorough testing, it turns out I had developed a severe case of myositis, a rare side effect of the vaccine. It's been a tough journey, but I'm grateful for the medical team who helped me through it. Remember, always listen to your body and seek help if you have any concerns post-vaccination."
11005,The second one was the worst for us. Luckily were retired so we could basically stay in bed all day. I Have had a lot of vaccines lived overseas for years and this is about the worst. But Ill take the protection because I understand Shingles is much worse.
11007,"Anyone else have experience with untreated /lasting effect from Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome?: Hi, my mom was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome mid December last year. Her vertigo symptoms still persist. She can barely walk to her bathroom. But sometimes it seems like it's getting better and she can manage to walk around as long as she has something to hold on to. But hearing about your dad living with vertigo for decades is heartbreaking. I really hope that's not the norm. She has noticed that the same ear is starting to itch. OMG. Has your dad ever experienced a recurrence in the same spot? I'm trying to find info but there is v little."
11015,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I got it in my mid thirties. I was going through a lot of stress and I got it on my fucking FACE. It was awfully truly painful for literal weeks with no pause. All day every day Hurt the whole time If you are reading this and wondering if you should get the vaccine here is my take do it
11016,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Vaccines have different efficacies in general they will lower the chance of contracting something and lower the chances of damage. Big benefits outweigh minimal risks. Its not like nature will say omg they are not vaccinated let us not infect them. Vaccinations are simply a more controlled safer exposure to disease although nothing is risk free. People still slip in showers or dressing.
11017,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Even with the chickenpox vaccine you can get shingles. My 8 year old has them right now. He got a weird rash on Monday. We tried some over the counter topicals like hydrocortisone cream for a couple of days. We took him to the doctor on Thursday because he said the rash hurt was throbbing and felt like spikey tingles. It is shingles. He started antivirals on Friday. I never knew childhood shingles was a thing.

11024,"First Shingles, how long to get vaccine?: I'm now 19 days into my first case of Shingles. It is slowly (vey slowly) getting better. I hope to never have this again. Does anyone know how long I have to wait to get the vaccine? I am a 68 year old male, otherwise in good health."
11026,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Shingles is horrific. I had it in my thirties. It was the first and hopefully only time I have ever been in so much pain that it made me throw up.
11031,Rinvoq and Shingles: Oh no I am sorry there is been no improvement. I had minor side effects with the antiviral but it seemed to help my symptoms ease quicker overall. I totally get feeling anxious especially when you are feeling worse. I remember the fever had me feeling especially awful and I got nervous when the coloration of the rash darkened for me it was like light pink then reddish then almost purplish over the course of a few weeks but thankfully I did not end up with any scarring. I hope you find relief soon.
11032,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles when i was 28. Bodies reaction to trauma had a large cyst the size of an orange twisting ovary basically. Then because I wad on an antiviral I had to wait two weeks for the surgery. So that was fun I guess it must be uncommon at a younger age and that is why they give shingles vaccines to seniors. But I know how bad it hurts Hopefully it clears up soon for you.
11033,Shingles vaccine: Depends on the person. My dad has been getting it for years and has no issues. If you look at me while holding a vaccine syringe I will start to have an immune reaction immediately. Have Not had this one yet but I know it will be like the others. Sick for three days.
11035,Shingrix: I feel like dog s ht chills body aches no appetite etc how long should this last? you have looked up the side effects of the shin gri x vaccine right? Also anyone have any issues with skin tearing? Are you still on prednisone? and how long have you been off of it?
11037,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: For me shingles have followed episodes where I had to take steroids usually 60mg prednisone a day for three to five days then repeat the dose several times within a month. For example in September I had surgery and had to take prednisone before the surgery to reduce the risk of anaphylactic reactions. Then a reaction to something used in my bladder during the surgery treated with steroids. Then a week after the surgery I had an allergic reaction to the glue and had to take steroids for five days. Then I had a bleeding episode and had to take steroids before contrast dye for a CT scan. Then I had a TIA and had to have another CT with contrast so more steroids. Then I got shingles.
11038,Shingles vaccine experience: The vaccine side effects are NOTHING compared to the pain I experienced with Shingles easily the worst pain I Have ever experienced get the vaccine
11042,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got the first dose. You do NOT want it in your eye. You will not be able to see think concentrate etc.
11043,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles is the worst pain I Have ever experienced and I have given birth to four kids. Any friend or relative who saw me when I had shingles has had the vaccine. Its torture like someone putting out 100 cigarettes on your skin 24 hours a day. I was in tears for most of the time I had it. Even loud or sudden noises made my scream in pain. I had acupuncture for seven months afterwards for post shingles pain. The whole area I had it chest and neck is still completely numb zero feeling five years later. I Am very pro doing anything you can to avoid this.
11048,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I did the series of 3 shots when I was 23 and just got 3 more at 37 years old. My provider recommended it since I have HPV and have had abnormal paps for 10 years. My insurance covered 100 of the cost of the shots.
11050,Hi I feel like I am a very rare case. I am a 36 years old male for the context. I had one shingles event like 4 or 5 years ago rash on the thorax below the breast. I had some pain around my upper back which was neuralgia. Took Acyclovir or Valacyclovir cannot remember pills cream and it went away quite easily. Then last September I have had shingles with rash behind my left shoulder in the upper back in a stressful moment of my life. I took Acyclovir immediately pills cream and it went away quickly and I suffered no pain whatsoever. But a few months later... Last January I had paresthesia under my left arm no rash nothing else. I had the feeling that my skin was burned but I could not see anything. I thought about a shingles without rash but I did not know so I waited... It went away and then came back. So I took Acyclovir pills. Then I do not remember exactly all the chronology but I had phases of paresthesia disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere around my pelvis for example. Right and then left. And in the end under my right arm. I went to see an infectiologist and he told me that it is soooo strange that it is moving like this around the body... And the blood test maybe 7 days after the last paresthesia ? said AntiVZV IgG antibodies Positive 2640 mUIml The doctor said that the meaning was that my body was constantly fighting against the virus is it true ? He prescribed me a 1year treatment of 500mg Valacyclovir 1 pill per day. Since that moment I had nerve pain appearing in my right arm and that lasted for about 2 weeks. Another doctor also infectiologist told me that it should be a postherpetic neuralgia PHN and that I should stop the 1year treatment and do a blood test 7 days after to check the status about VZV. Above all he said that IgG means that I have had shingles once in my life and that it does not mean that my body is constantly fighting against the virus What should I think about it ? IgM was not shown in the analysis apparently this omission would mean that it was negative ? And last thing I have to say is that after this PHN in my right arm I was feeling much better no symptoms whatsoever. And in my mind I felt protected and relieved to have this 1year treatment of Valacyclovir.. I did not want to stop it both doctors have opposite advices . But since yesterday morning I have hyperesthesia appearing again around the left of my hip Despite taking my 500mg Valacyclovir per day. I am extremely worried and seek for your help I was already trying to manage my stress already taking vitamin C and probiotics pills everyday... And exercising... What else can I do ? Llysine ? And what about the vaccine ? I have read some people say it has to be avoided at all costs. And also I do not know from what moment I can start taking it... Because if shingles never gives me a break maybe it means I will bever be able to have it ? Last question I have been suffering from gender dysphoria since my 7 years old approximately in the 90s before anyone talked about transgenre stuff this is real suffering in my mind. Can it be linked to all my problems ? I have had 3 atrial fibrillation events since my 31 years old upon very light alcool intake and am now taking Flecaine every day to avoid further event... I am really thinking of starting a MtF HRT but I wonder if it could make my shingles worse ? Or maybe the relief induced by the transition could help me feel better in my head and then have less shingles ? Thank you so much in advance for your help...
11053,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had one tiny little patch of shingles on my neck and I thought I was going to die from the pain. Not to mention the general discomfort from an active virus. I was incredibly lucky to catch it early because I had just read an article about early shingles presentation. My diagnosing physician said it was the earliest case she had ever seen. I have been incredibly paranoid about it ever since. Ironically I am so grateful that I have an immune condition that gives me access to the shingles vaccine at 45. I usually hate my autoimmune disease but this time I am grateful for it.
11054,Living the life we have to live... sucks: Circling back to OPs questions-- Yes to being sick is harder. You may take longer to get over a cold or flu or tonsillitis than you did before DMTs. But compared to nerve damage that's mild Keep track of your mental health and brain fog as well as physical health. Some of the DMTs messed w my thinking clarity. I'm also in IT. And I just couldn't keep up on one of the meds I stopped after like 6 weeks. The bad part this isn't rare. Treating MS is kind of like being in an experiment. Keep good tabs on how you react and be very open w medical team
11056,I Am so sorry that you have had to go through all this. I Have had Shingles but fortunately I had a mild dose because Id had the vaccine 12 months prior. I Have also been on Lyrica for other pain ghastly drug. Hope you have a wonderful birthday tomorrow. Happy Birthday
11057,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Got cha. I get gout flare ups but meds fixed that. I had wrist pain that felt like a million needle work it is way around my wrist. I would sleep for 2 hrs a night for 2 week. I always wonder what caused that
11058,Excruciating pain it feels never ending. Is this normal?: Yes. Our other friends on here mentioned this Go to your ophthalmologist. I had previous cataract surgery in January and my shingles hit in March. My doctor said that shingles can wreak havoc for your retina. You might need special drops. By the time I got through my Shingles nightmare I went to 3 doctors 1. Primary Care doctor 2. Dermatologist primary care doctor referred me 3. Ophthalmologist. I honestly would not wish Shingles on my worst enemy. Its so painful. Lightning bolts at 10 second intervals painful
11059,Shingles vaccine: GET THE SHOT I did not realize I needed a shingles shot I was mid fifties. I thought it was a shot you got in your early sixties. At first I thought it was a rash. Then it was not. The shingles were excruciatingly painful. You can have after effects for months. My friend had it in her eye yes her eye. Pay whatever you need to out of pocket to avoid this hell.
11061,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: It is not horrible but I definitely get some flu like symptoms from both shots. Although everyone is different... My suggestion would be to get it late afternoon so you can sleep through some of it. Nyquil FTW.
11064,I would be willing to bet that you got shingles a few weeks after the first covid shot
11066,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I had the chicken pox naturally. Very badly. It was actually inside of me as well as outside in every place you can think of. I was miserable for several weeks and recall bathing in that pink calamine lotion. There are probably pictures of me in medical textbooks because I vividly remember being photographed to an absurd degree by doctors and one of them saying This is like something you would put in a textbook. Thankfully it never got into my eyes somehow I know someone who lost an eye that way. It may have sterilized me though. Good times. 010 I do not recommend chicken pox. Oh And as an aside I am 37 and am pretty sure I had shingles on my torso a few months back which is odd for my age. Felt very weird painful took a long time to heal. So this virus will probably kill me when I am old. Haha. What a way to die huh?
11068,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: It was rough for me too it ll subside in a day or two
11069,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: A friend of mines sister was hospitalized and passed away due to complications from the flu.
11070,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Good luck Please post back on your decision and what followed. 1 If you ever do have a lot of local reaction to any shot such as redness and heat or a tight feeling in the injection area an ice packfrozen peas to the area can be very helpful true of any shot as well as ibuprofen. Such reactions are uncommon. 2 FWIW for anyone who has not had shingles and not been vaccinated for shingles or chickenpox  the outbreak of the shingles rash is almost always preceded by abnormal skin sensations in the affected area or even in tissues deeper than the skin. Commonly it is described as tingling or burning but more notably it can be hard to describe or feel like deep weird pain. If you then monitor your skin carefully actively looking for redness or small bumps and see the shingles or zoster rash at its beginning you can obtain prescription antiviral pills that basically nip it in the bud. Mild rash. Few blisters. Minimal or no nerve pain. Its an effort because its hard to get diagnosed and treated immediately but worth it. Having taught the importance of early identification  preemptive shingles treatment I still needed more than a day to diagnose myself with shingles before vaccines I had an unusual vague discomfort in my right abdomen but it did not fit with any familiar itis and I did not have any worrisome findings. The second night I was thinking What IS this?? and suddenly I realized shingles I dashed to the mirror and there on my back was a definite faint pink blotch with maybe three small bumps  shingles has a wraparound effect depending on what part of the body is affected. My discomfort was on my front but the rash appeared on my back. I began taking Valtrex immediately and the rash resolved without progressing. This might not be very helpful to know now since the overall chances of getting shingles are decreasing year by year. That Is because chickenpox vaccination is routinely given to children and should be and they will not be at risk for shingles later in life and Shingrix is a very effective vaccine to prevent shingles in those of us born too early for the chickenpox vaccine. I Am still putting it out there in case it helps even one person avoid fullblown shingles which can just wreck your life when severe or if it affects the eye or ear etc. Shingrix is one vaccine NOT to skip.
11072,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Insurance will not pay for shingles vaccine under 50. I asked because I had a very mild case of shingles in my 30's and I felt like my skin was being branded when gently touched. It is fucking awful.
11074,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I second this I found out 3 days ago that I have Shingles. It is on my left side shoulder chest upper back neck and face. It is causing stabbing pain in my jaw area and elbow. It really is hell.
11077,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Hahaha Mine is sore too like it will kind of hurt out of nowhere then stop
11078,This does not look like the pictures of shingles on the internet. It just feels like a sunburn in the area. No pain. To me it looks like an infection with blisters. I am not a doctor. But the provider i seen today is not sure. They are treating it as shingles. I questioned the diagnosis to the provider because i never had chicken pox.Only the vaccine. This feels like when my hand got infected and needed antibiotics. This is on the back of my leg. And the redness is getting redder and bigger each day. This picture is day 4.
11081,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Speaking as someone who recently got the shingles vaccine and is currently dealing with a case of shingles getting the shot does not mean you will never get shingles. It should make it less severe and less likely to because long term complications if you do get it.
11086,Did your parents make you go play with the kid who had chicken pox?: EVERYBODY who got chicken pox make sure you get shingles vaccine around mid to late 40 s. Shingles is a horrible condition caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. You already have it in your body like herpes it is cousin it never goes away. My wife got shingles on the side of her face and has gone blind in her right eye from it. It can show up anywhere on your body from a small area to a very large area. It itches like crazy and can because nerve damage to the area under it. My mother in law got it also and lost most of the use of her left hand. GET YOUR VACCINE. Research shingles if you do not believe me. You do not want it. I have gotten my vaccine already.
11087,Hi all I have been reading this sub for a while and during difficult times it helped me a lot to read some of your success stories. For that reason I wanted to share my positive outcomes for anyone needing encouragement. I am 35 I had a LEEP procedure earlier this year and just got my six month results back normal and HPV negative. No words can describe the relief. I have had HPV for at least the past 10 years that is when I was first tested for it. HPV 12 or other not 1618. I had low grade abnormalities on and off since 2017 but was always told not to worry as most women clear this on their own. I gave birth first baby February of this year after which my OB told me a lot of women clear CIN at childbirth. Well as it happens to a lot of us in the same boat the most women rule did not apply here either. My 8 week postpartum pap smear came back abnormal with high grade changes this time at least CIN2 in the endocervix on the ECC. Unfortunately and this is Kaiser in California I did not get answers for a long time. Eventually I had a call with my OB who said my results are unusual and that they cannot rule out cancer. She said they sent out the results by error I was not supposed to see them. They do a phone call for bad news like this.. This was a lot on my mental health given how early postpartum I was too. I struggled to keep my milk supply going and it was hard to focus on bonding with my baby because of the constant anxiety. Fast forward a couple of weeks when I finally managed to get an appointment for a colposcopy and got its results back it was CIN 12. Something they told me on the spot and I did not realize before even though I had countless colposcopies before is that they do not biopsy the endocervix the colposcopy is done on the outside only. So basically this was not going to get us any closer to understanding the ECC reaults. The colposcopy was actually a waste of time the doctor who told me to get it likely misread my results. They advised a LEEP at this point given the ECC results. I had my LEEP in May did not go under and it was pretty quick. The lidocaine shots were awful but the rest was fine. The doctor removed a good amount but not too much as I said I will likely want to have more kids in the future. He mentioned after the procedure that he was hoping to get even more from the endocervix but my cervix is tiny ?? so he was not able to get as much without risk of injuring surrounding tissue. I was sad to go home without at least some encouragement from the doctor. Results came back a week or so after and it was very surprising. Endocervix tissue came back entirely clean the outside on the other hand was CIN 23. So basically both the ECC and the colposcopy were wrong but combined they were sort of right. They concluded clear margins even though the outside slice had CIN on the edge because the adjoining endocervix tissue taken was clean. Between the LEEP and today I have not done anything differently than before in terms of lifestyle. If anything sleep has been quite bad with a baby at home. I already ate healthy mostly plantbased too and exercised moderately though never enough. However I read a study after my LEEP where they concluded that getting the HPV vaccine after LEEP within a certain amount of weeks helped some people clear it so I thought why not. I had the first shot prepregnancy in 2023 and took the next one about two weeks after LEEP last one just recently. I am grateful for my results but the amount of anxiety they put me through was truly unnecessary. All I needed to hear is just one you will be fine but I did not get it from any of the staff at my provider. I was already in therapy due to my traumatic birth experience and in hopes of avoiding PPD so that helped a lot to be able to talk about it with someone. High recommend. It is a tough journey to go through alone and you have to do your best to advocate for yourself. Hang in there
11088,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I had shingles about 2 years ago here in my 30s. I recovered well but it is kind of a dull achey pain that runs from ankles to shoulders that remain. It is bearable but it does contribute to avoiding certain movements doing certain tasks. SNRIs did help with this pain but they interfere with my other medications.
11091,Shingles vaccine: I just had a very sore arm. I Am on Humira.
11092,Hi I am a healthy 37m and have had at least 2 bouts of confirmed strep in the last four months likely a third as well six months ago that went undiagnosed. The possible bout was in January. Felt like I had bad flu for 34 days and gradually got better but took a full 8 days to get back on my feet. Fever aches no appetite basically the flu with no coughing or congestion. Tested negative for flu and covid but did not get strep test because no sore throat and I got better after a while. The second was a day after I returned from traveling abroad for work trip in midFebruary. Same symptoms as above but sore throat. Got 7 days of amoxicillin and finished the course. The third was 8 days ago. After a week of on and off fever I went to urgent care. Currently halfway through a 7 day course of amoxicillin. Each time except for the possible first undiagnosed one I have switched out my toothbrushes day 1 3 and 7 into antibiotics and wiped down surfaces religiously. For what it is worth I have two young kids and a wife and none of them have had strep any of these times as far as we know. I have always thought my immune system sort of sucked. I had shingles at 27. Questions 1. Is it possible to have the same strep 4 months apart? Why would that happen? Again no one else in my family is coming down with it as far as we can tell so doubt it is a carrier in my family. What I see online is recurrent strep happening more rapid succession when antibiotics are not working but so far the antibiotics seem to have worked. At least they did after February. 2. I am considering going to an ENT. Would they be able to tell me anything helpful or help prevent any recurrence even though I am finishing antibiotics for this last round of strep already?
11094,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: I had shingles last year on my scalp forehead and most unfortunately in my eye. The eye has lost some vision and I am still seeing 2 ophthalmologists one year later due to inflammation and permanent damage. I did not lose my vision in that eye entirely thankfully. I always recommend the vaccine to those who are eligible. In addition to the effects to the eye I missed a lot of work at an important time and the illness had a large emotional impact which I think is often overlooked by the medical community. And of course the pain. I had a scary icepick headache before the rash started that sent me to the ER for an MRI. Did I mention the night a few weeks after the start when it felt like I had someone standing on my head while I tried to sleep? Scared the shit out of me. I know my case is in the worst 10 of cases. But still get the vaccine.
11099,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got a shingles in my mid 20s. It was a patch of painful rash that would not go away I did not even know what shingles was I just thought I would been bit by a spider and finally went to urgent care. I definitely do not want it again but all I hear from older friends and relatives is how much the vaccine sucked and I am like really? The Covid vaccine was absolute hell and I will keep taking that baby Give me the shingles vaccine please
11104,RSV Shot side effects?: Yep My red itchy swollen bump lasted approximately 10 days
11107,RSV vaccine?: My three week old got it today and it went perfectly fine. He cried for about 20 seconds and then was over it and hungry again
11109,RSV vaccine: I hope you feel better soon I was lucky to not have any side effects from the RSV vaccine.
11117,Shingles vaccine?: Shingles vaccine was worst for next day blues over anything else.
11120,"Vaccine dilemma: The aftermath of receiving the Pfizer vaccines has been nothing short of a nightmare for me. Initially, I encountered a minor reaction with itchy bumps on my hands after the first two doses. However, the situation escalated dramatically following the booster shot in November 2021. A severe rash spread across my legs and arms, causing such discomfort that I sought immediate medical attention at Patient First. The prescribed prednisone led to a series of complications, including dangerously low heart rate and fainting spells that necessitated an emergency room visit. Despite undergoing a battery of tests and consultations with specialists, the root cause of my adverse reaction remains elusive. While some have attributed it to eczema or potentially shingles, additional concerns such as unexplained inflammation have surfaced during diagnostic procedures. The medical community's inability to provide concrete answers, coupled with the uncertainties surrounding the ""newish"" vaccine, has left me in a state of limbo regarding future vaccinations. Faced with the looming threat of COVID-19 and my body's unpredictable responses to medications, I delved into extensive research before deciding to schedule another booster appointment. However, my hopes were dashed when the pharmacist at CVS declined to administer the vaccine, citing concerns about potential worsening reactions. The suggestion to consider the Moderna vaccine comes with its own set of uncertainties, leaving me grappling with fear and indecision amid a sea of unanswered questions. (Side note: My experience with Hydroxychloroquine also involved a temporary decrease in heart rate, which normalized after a few weeks of usage.)"
11124,Oh as in.... I am on my 6th covid vaccine and just got my 17th annual flu vaccine and 3rd shingles shot 1st monkey pox and chicken pox shots. I need it to protect me as I am taking all these lovely pharmacuticals for Myocarditis Blood Clots AutoImmune Disorder Diabetes Weakness
11126,Got my Shingles vaccine: Got both shots about a month apart. No issues with the first the second felt a little like body aches and fatigue but was gone in a few days. I know someone who was off work for most of a month with shingles. He was in his 30's and healthy and he said it was the worst pain he would ever experienced.
11127,Hi everyone I fell head first on to concrete in February of this year. I needed stitches and bleed severely because of my head wound. My eyes and back were absolutely demolished by the fall and I required a back brace for 6 months and needed a very strict and awful regimen of antiinflammatory eye drops for 7 months. I was diagnosed with PCS by an opthalmogist. But I am happy to say that I no longer have PCS in my eyes It took physio and a lot of rest but it got better I still have drier eyes than the average person but I do not randomly lose vision anymore. Unfortunately I found out I do not have PCS anymore because I have shingles in my face and ear and needed to see an opthalmogist again lol. But I wanted to share this because so much of what I see is despair in other concussion groups. I have had 2 concussions in my life. My 2nd one was crazy though I vomited and was confused and lost vision. I thought I had gone blind for a little while. But I am okay now I hope people will get some hope from this post. It took almost the whole year but I am good now 
11128,Recurring shingles advice: I Have had it 910 times in the last decade. I start valcyclovir within 48 hours usually because otherwise the nerve pain becomes my whole life and I cannot function. I rode out the first one not knowing what it was until I got home to my pcp. Never again. My rash is also minimal but the pain exhaustion without meds is debilitating.
11130,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got Shingle in January of 2021  to compound it even worse I got Covid a week after I got Shingles needless to say I was very miserable during the whole ordeal. So last year I got the vaccine because my doctor told me that I could get it again.
11132,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: A couple of people i talked to said the 2nd Shingrix dose kicked their ass.
11134,Shingles vaccine experience: Be careful and be aware of guillain Barre Syndrome. Shingles vaccine is one of the causes. I have the nerve pain on my whole body have not worn a bra since and I still need a walker. its been 2 years. Never stack vaccinations Guillain Barre is something you need to know about if you get this vaccine.
11135,I knew 15 people who died prematurely of illness since 2021. My son got hearing loss in one ear. My nephew got myocarditis. My daughter and her husband got shingles. Several others I know are battling cancer.
11137,Shingles vaccine experience: I never had any reaction to my 3 shingles shots at all. Was very happy about that.
11139,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Oh my god I Am so sorry. You Are so tough to be dealing with those chronic conditions My first levels of pain from my shingles was probably anywhere from 79 out of 10 rivaling the back injury I had in the past. But the other evening I went through a crazy flare up where it was like twice as bad as what I had been experiencing. So now I say that night was probably a 9 and all the previous shingles pain like a 35. Now I think back to my old injuries and I Am just like oh those were nothing Its truly such a crazy experience to have all your previous conceptions of pain just totally flipped on their head.
11140,I think I said 3 people I know directly. The two youngest have myocarditis and possibly a strokeMS it is being explored. Older one had shingles jab side only. You are lucky you do not know anyone who had been affected.2 females in our family muscarried directky after vaccine
11141,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: Jesus. 23 years When she gets it its debilitating.
11148,I knew a person who took at least one COVID jab that I know of and got shingles. She thought it was due to stress. Ya due to stress of the COVID jab on her immunity.
11149,Shingles vaccine: Had shingles. Def get the 2 shot vaccine. I think if you reach out to the pharma company you can secure a reduced rate..
11151,I received both shots last year. Not one time have I ever heard anyone say Shingles? Oh it was not so bad. Get. The. Vaccine.
11153,My griend got RSV shot at the VA. Was feeling poorly for three days after. Said no to the covid jab.
11154,Tiredness muscle pain headache shivering fever stomach pain and nausea are common after recombinant shingles vaccine. the VIS every patient is required to be handed before getting Shingrix.
11155,Thought it was heat rash lol: My nerves were on fire and then the jolts of pain felt like I was getting electrocuted. As bad as it was during the day the pain would get worse at night it was constant at night. Barely slept any and could not lay on the side my rash was on at all. Four months later and I still have pain laying on that side at times feels like pins sticking me now instead of the electrocution like pain when I had the rash. I have 2 sons had to go through labor and csection with both the pain I had with shingles is just as bad or worse as labor pains.
11160,41 and got Shingles: I got them in my mid 30s. Thankfully they only ran up and down my left leg but it was surprisingly painful as from what my doctor told me they run along your major nerve line. It was a wakeup call for me in that they were 100 caused by my stress load compromising my immune system enough to where after a particularly brutal month they just popped up. I Have made some lifestyle changes and way better these days. They gave me some of those giant antibiotic horse pills and I think within three days or so it was largely gone. I was a little worried it would leave scarring but zero trace at all these days.
11162,RSVP vaccine and others: I am a pediatric nurse and I got my RSV vaccine yesterday. We see so many kids get sick with RSV and other viruses during this time of year. I would not want to watch my child to go through what I Have seen other children experience at work. I felt really crummy getting my updated flu and covid vaccine but luckily with the RSV vaccine I felt nothing. Not even a sore arm
11165,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Oh my word Apparently she fractured her skull in this fall.
11166,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: Because anytime I do something like get sick or take a vaccine it will bring my immunity titer down and I get another round of shingles. This round is still active after getting covid on July 3rd. I have had four rounds of shingles. I do plan on taking the 2nd dose if I ever get over the shingles.
11170,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles as a kid and could not feel it. Had it again in my 40s and it was hell I thought I would pulled my intercostal muscles all round one side of my ribs and it just kept getting worse. I was also utterly wiped out. If there had been a vaccine when I was a kid my parents would have been waiting at the door for the first day I could have had it. There is a reason that we have developed vaccines for many of the 'childhood' illnesses and that is because most of them can have long term consequences and some of them are potentially fatal. Trish was able to make decisions for her own children but not for anyone else's. I can only hope that her shingles were excruciatingly painful
11173,TLDR I had 69 months where I suddenly had much worse vision in one eye and during that time I was exhausted grumpy and my hair got super weird. It was corrected with cataract surgery and immediately I felt my life go from difficulty level 10 to 1. I have seen a lot of eye docs in the past year and none of them seem to take seriously how hard my brain was working to compensate for the vision issues or how much that made my life suck. Posting this in case you have a similar experience so you will know it is not just you. It seems like this should be obvious to docs since they know that patching is really hard on people's brains I think most people with good vision think that the challenges of low vision are practical and while that is obviously true I suspect a lot of people with low vision have this ongoing brain load that nobody gives them credit for dealing with. If anyone knows researches who study this I have an interest and have not been able to find them. Longer version My brain may deal with vision differently than other people. I have always had vision in my right eye that on its own needed correction. As a child my parents were told I would not wear glasses which was probably right. When I was 14 I complained and got glasses and while I really did not see differently with them on or off not wearing my glasses made me tired and so I wore them pretty much all the time. I was a vain teenager so I would go without them for prom and stuff like that. As an adult multiple optometrists told me they were surprised I wore my glasses. I had one optometrist tell me he was glad I had because I would likely have developed a lazy eye if I had not worn them. Also as an adult my vision in the right eye got progressively worse I pretty much always had a new prescription every year. Totally unrelated I had a retina scan at about age 35 that showed white spots on my retina which the optometrist could not find in his textbook. He actually pulled out a textbook. The world used to be different. He said as long as they did not change it probably did not matter. He said if they were black they would be macular degeneration but they were are white. Then totally unrelated to everything that came before I got shingles at age 47. I would begged for the vaccine but no one would let me have it because at the time it was only approved for people 50 and up. The guidelines have changed now and so it is much easier for docs to prescribe the vaccine to people under 50. Anyway I got shingles in my right eye. Zero stars do not recommend. The inflammation was pretty bad and to protect my cornea I had to use steroid eye drops which freaked the doctors out but were necessary. I tapered off them several times but each time the inflammation would come roaring back and we would be back to the beginning. I had to switch to a new doctor who I was told was a retina specialist but was actually a cataract specialist. The good thing was that he was less afraid of steroid eye drops than your average doc because the biggest risk with those eye drops is that they increase your risk of cataracts. He explained to me that he would like to taper me off of the eye drops but that if the inflammation damaged my cornea the options were very limited and if I got cataracts he could fix that no problem. We tried several more times to very slowly taper down and failed each time. If you are ever in this position I do recommend the Round app for the iphone it is great for keeping track of medication doses. I saw this doctor every 4 months to check on the inflammation consider our tapering options check for glaucoma another side effect of the drops and I thought check for cataracts. Turns out I was wrong about that last bit. During the summer of 2023 shortly after I would seen my cataract specialist doc I started to hate driving at night. Lights were a little distorted but my right eye has a very real astigmatism so this was not shocking. Since I would just been cleared by the doc I figured I was just progressing towards my next glasses prescription. That said I really hated driving and night and mostly stopped doing it. My husband and I drove about 90 minutes somewhere one night and I wound up in tears without really being able to explain why. This is the same time my hair got really weird which I thought was unrelated. It was not that big a deal I figured my hair had a good run and now I was 50 and I should just adjust. Then about six months later lights were super distorted in a way they never had been before I saw six lights for every one. Conveniently I had an appointment with my eye doc two weeks after that and given how hard he is to give an appointment with I knew there was no quicker option. So I went to see him and we did the usual tests including that hot air balloon test. I could not ever see one hot air balloon and I have done these tests many times so while I did not know what that meant I do know it meant something bad. I found out later the machine reads cataract when this happens I also told them about how lights looked and even drew a little picture of what I was seeing. I also did the standard cover one eye and read the chart vision test. I learned that if you cannot read the top line they keep going to bigger lines until there is just one giant letter on the screen and with my left eye covered I could not even tell it was a letter. At this point I am 50 years old and the pity dripping off of the nurse doing the test was intense. So I figure I am about to get some very bad news from the doctor The doctor comes in and takes a look and says that I have oily tears and my tear ducts are clogged and I should do warm compresses. What great news I went home and bought one of those little electric eye warmer masks and used it several times a day and indeed my tears got less oily. Lovely Sadly it did not change my vision one bit. I called back and said that did not work and he said okay you need new glasses and sent me to an optometrist. The optometrist took one look at me and the hot air balloon test and said some version of that is a hell of a cataract and sent me back to the doctor who would diagnosed me with oily tears. I called his office and was told I could see him in about 4 months. I explained that he would missed my cataract and that my life sucked and they said too bad. This was a bad day. I got an appointment with a different cataract specialist who could see me much sooner. He also said some version of that is a hell of a cataract and that my vision in my right eye with my glasses on was 20300. He also said those white spots on my retina needed to be checked out before surgery and sent me to a retina specialist. It was at this point that I really started thinking about my vision and realized that the clear picture my brain was showing me was at least in some part a lie. I could sit in the driver's seat of the car and see a clear picture of the entire intersection in front of me with my head facing straight including things on my right. I did not perceive any difference in clarity on the two sides. I was also finding that driving just destroyed me somehow and I felt like I would done something exhausting rather than driving 10 minutes. So I stopped driving which was okay because I am a very fortunate person except for this foolishness. The surgery got scheduled for a few months later. I went to see the retina specialist who diagnosed me with a rare genetic disease retinal pattern dystrophy and solved some family mysteries while he as at it. That will probably be fine but there is not a lot of info so we will just have to see Life is an adventure. I reached out to a friend who is a neuroscientist and said hey my brain is doing something that neuroscientists seem to not know much about and someone might want to fMRI me before my vision gets fixed and my brain stops doing it. There was no interest which is understandable because brains are wild and there is plenty of other stuff to investigate During this time I was really stressed and everything just felt so hard. I had a lot of things to blame the stress on but I could not really be sure where it was coming from. The only thing I found that reduced the stress was closing my eyes for 20 minutes or more. Then I got the surgery. I paid for the fancy lens so 24 hours later my right eye which had been increasingly useless for 35 years was suddenly 2030. Going from 20300 to 2030 in a day is really something else but the important thing is that the world did not look different to me. Instead my difficulty level just went from 10 to 1 instantly. Driving at night? No problem. Keeping my eyes open all day? No problem. Feeling energetic for an entire day? No problem Also my hair got better although that was gradual over 4 weeks. My friends assure me stress causes hair to do weird stuff. Anyway the moral of the story for me is that a lot of people with low vision are probably living life on a difficulty level that most people do not appreciate.
11174,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: As someone who just had it a week ago at the age of 30 I can confirm that shingles is not fun
11181,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: If you are able to afford it good to get a second opinion and see different doctor if you are not confident of the doctor's diagnostics. Shingles sucks. I got it on my back and had to sleep on only one side of my body for several days.
11191,Shingles Is NO Joke: My Mum got it a few years ago on her face and the doctors were worried because if it gets in your eyes you can end up blind. When I was in grade 8 a friend of mine got shingles. She was 13 and the rash was all over her chest and back. She could not wear a bra for months. I have been afraid of Shingles ever since and plan to get the vaccine when I get a job and can afford it.
11192,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shingles vaccine sucked both times. Worth it times a million. I Have seen shingles. Covid vaccine nothing zilch. Been directly exposed did not get it. Also worth it.
11196,I 22F got diagnosed with UC almost a year ago now. I started mesalamine and had no side effects and no flares. Back in September I had intense upper abdomen pain nausea and could not eat. Went to the doctor and my lipase levels were through the roof. Had to go to the ER for a CT scan and turns out I had pancreatitis. Pain and nausea lessened but I had to take about two weeks off work because it never really went away. I was able to go back to work but went back to the doctor and my levels were down but still over the normal limit. Turns out mesalamine was the because of my pancreatitishas anyone else had pancreatitis because off these meds?? Anyways I stopped the meds back in November and have been off meds ever since. In December my calprotein levels were at 108 so nothing crazy. I felt mostly okay but was having minor pain on the toilet nothing compared to my first flare. During all this my Dr. prescribed Xeljanz insurance denied it after I got my Xray and shingles shotwhatever. Dr. then prescribed Humira in December. Crazy crazy stuff with a certain speciality pharmacy that kept delay delaying claiming they needed xyz documents. Made probably 50 calls to this place over the last two months. Finally yesterday after my doctors offices persistence and threatening to report them to the state I finally got approved for Humira. It arrived today but I am going out of town this week and have a huge eventful weekend that I have been looking toward to for almost a year will include drinking. Right now because I have extremely minor symptoms still same minor pain as back in December I am thinking to wait until I am back in town to start the injection and because I had a severe reaction to the last meds I do not want to start it right before my big week. Should I delay another week because what is another week after all these months? If you are on Humira what was your first dose like and did you notice any side effects? Also do you drink alcohol on Humira and how does that go?
11197,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Did it look like blisters when it first formed? From the people I know that have had it that is not quite what it looks like. NAD. But would recommend you seeing one.
11209,Shingles Shot 2: My second one was also pretty rough.
11211,Does PSHP Cover Shingrix ?: 380 you have to pay 190 for 1st shot then you need a shingles booster for same price 190 again highly recommend I had shingles last year and had to wait a whole year to get a vaccinne was terrified it would come back within that year but thank god it did not
11215,Vaccine injuries reported: Oh thank you so much for sharing this. I Have been on lockdown since the first shot. I Have been gaslit for 3 years now. This will help me hopefully be better able to advocate for myself again when I have the energy. Vaccine injuries are no joke. Much love and appreciation from California.
11219,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: Get the vaccine if you can I had a cancer on the base of my tongue that was diagnosed as a HPV type. Bring 62 att the time there was no vaccine in my youth. Cancer sucks My doc said research is indicating all cancers may be caused by viruses interacting with the remnants of the virus DNA in our system. I just know chemotherapy and radiation are a horrible way to waste your day
11223,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: It is been very bad for her. But if you read into it the chances of postherpetic neuralgia increases with age. And that is what she is got.
11225,Hi everyone. I Am 31 years old and was diagnosed with shingles 2 years ago. It was on left shoulder and mid back so I did not see it for some time. I Have had the pain from the shingles for about 2 years. Since then the pain has gotten worse and now traveled to my left arm and hand and now even my left leg and feet. I feel like my whole left side is on fire and throbbing and stabbing pain all the time. I Am on lyrica dulaxitine and tramadol. I Have gotten epidural steroid shots in my back 3 times and its only gotten worse. They Have done an EMG on me and could not find anything. I Am feeling completely hopeless as to what to do next. This pain is unbearable and I cannot imagine living the rest of my life like this. Anyone have any suggestions as to what to do next? I Am feeling hopeless and of course the doctors keep telling me they do not know anything. Thank you and I hope you all have a pain free day.
11231,My Mom recently had shingles she got the tetanus shot back this spring along with some other vaccines earlier I was not aware of . She Is had her worst year ever.
11232,Shingles with an infant?: Hi. I current have shingles with a 3 month old. I washed my hands and did not let him come in contact with the rash. I'm not breastfeeding on that side with the rash until it's scabbed over and I was advised to pump and dump until rash scabbed over. It's almost done though. Good luck!
11234,Shingles vaccine experience: My wife and I got ours as soon as we could after my 92 year dad got a shingles outbreak on his head two Halloweens ago lied about how much of his bald head he was scratching and then broke out in full on Day of the Dead lesions all across the top of his head. If was the grossest thing I ever saw and I was sure I was going to vomit every time he sat down for dinner with us. Two consecutive very sore arms did not seem a high price to pay. They were damn sore for two weeks apiece though.
11237,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: That's great! I give up every few years (it's been over 20) but have been on a steady mission to figure this out for the last 3 years. Appreciate you sharing!!"
11238,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: This would absolutely end my marriage. I am furious for OOP and her baby I have a very prominent chicken pox scar on my forehead. In my 40s I barely notice it but it was horrible growing up. I have a couple others nose and cheek but that one you cannot miss. I was teased and super selfconscious about it for YEARS. My youngest brother got it so bad that they ended up down his throat. He could not eat and was hospitalized. He also had terrible eczema so the itching was absolute torture. On top of that all three of us kids had it at the same time... it was really traumatic for the whole family. I had friends tell me I was being silly when I got my oldest son vaccinated. It was a newer vaccine at that point and everyone was all but it is not even that bad... even after telling people about my brother almost dying and pointing to my own face. We also lived with my grandma at the time... it would have been absolutely terrible if she got shingles because my toddler came home with chicken pox. No one questioned when I got my younger son vaccinated. They are almost 11 years apart and more of us love an old person who has suffered from shingles at this point I guess. Regardless of ALL of this it is absolutely insane that OOP's MIL would put a BABY through something that is completely preventable. Like why allow them to suffer even mildly if you can prevent it?
11239,38yr old woman in USA. Currently take famotidine vit D3 magnesium glycinate and a small dose of CBD tincture daily. In June I was diagnosed with a small ulcer with accompanying localized moderate gastritis after deep sharp pain under my right rib that sent me to the ER in May. Suspected by doc as being due to NSAID overuse negative for all other things in biopsies. I have had my gallbladder removed and have been finding a way to manage bile acid malabsorption but have been doing fair gutwise recently. Never had any liver or pancreas issues. 4 days ago I very suddenly started having a deep pulsing stabbing pain in a specific location in my lower left ribs. Very specific spot and only ever there. When I lie perfectly still in bed or in a chair relaxed the pain will eventually calm down. As soon as I start moving around it returns. No specific movement seems to trigger it or help it. Sometimes breathing hurts when its really escalated but no breathing issues. It does not seem correlated to any gut things. Pressing on it does not hurt. Sometimes it feels like something moves that causes a sharp pain. It almost feels nervelike and I have had shingles on my face before. No rash or other signs of fighting a virus as I had when I had shingles. I guess the only other potential symptom is fatigue but that is not really new for me. I spent the entire day today in urgent care and then the ER ruling out heart issues and lung embolism. EKG xray and all labs CBC metabolic ddimer troponin vitals were perfectly normal. I was told they could do nothing because I cannot take NSAIDs as I recover from my ulcer. Where do I go from here? The pain has me in tears tonight. I feel like I cannot move because the pain gets so severe it stops me in my tracks gasp makes me tense and hold my breath as it pulsates and throbs sharply. The only thing I can come up with is that I was crouched over coloring in a colorong book for too long a time and somehow pinched a nerve or inflamed something or my rib is slipping. Could this just be an intercostal irritation? Is more needed to rule out gut involvement? My wife is 9 months pregnant my stress is pretty high. Looking for some guidance to get this figured out quickly. It is so painful. I am doing ice heat Epsom salt baths tiger balm and tylenol to try and cope but I really think only being still is what makes it quieter. Thank you for any help.
11240,41 and got Shingles: Yep had it at 38. Got really close to my eye too. Most pain I Have endured. Could Not sleep because closing my eye on the side affected was worse than having them open.
11245,Same for me. I will say that by the time it kicked in it was early evening because I had my shot late in the day. So I went on to bed and was almost normal the next day. So I scheduled the 2nd one for 4pm and did the same thing the second time. Rough but way better than shingles
11247,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got shingles at 39 are not no joke scarred my back
11250,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents did that to me in the early 70's when I was 2. I do not think they knew about the link between chicken pox and shingles back then and it was very common to see a chicken pox party. I was so young that I do not remember getting them which I feel fortunate about because I have seen friends get it when they were older and they looked miserable. I got the shingles vaccine the second I could.
11252,and let us not talk about shingles....i am a vaccine victim of it.
11257,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the chickenpox vaccine when I was a kid
11259,30YO male here. Here is my shingles story. Just as the title says. 2 weeks ago one afternoon I felt an itchy spot on the upper part of my back. I remember shrugging it off and scratching it violently the first day or so. Second day around I felt it still. Tried to get some pictures with my camera and in one shot I saw how I have had small bumps gathered in a bunch all red. Something I have not encountered yet so I have started googling for hints on what it could be. I found some apps do not have their name deleted which claimed to diagnose different skin conditions. Uploaded my picture result came in  80 Zoster virus. So you know those memes on how google can diagnose you with cancer at any given moment? It found a way to do that to me too. Panic settled in so I went to the pharmacy and I have been given an ointment and some pain medication. Started using both that night. By this time the need to scratch it turned to a slight burning sensation  the kind you feel when you are sunburnt and some clothing touches your skin. The first few nights I was terrified to sleep on my back. So days went by I applied the cream 23 times a day. Besides my REALLY tolerable small burning sensation on that two inch shingles spot I have had no symptoms. The bumps turned into small blister like dots after which they scabbed and fell down. It lasted around two weeks. I am so lucky and thankful that it did not grow in size or that it did not bring any major pain.
11260,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember chicken pox parties but I do not think I ever went to one. Being the medical mystery of the family I never got chicken pox but I did get a very nasty case of shingles when I was all of 16yearsold. It was awful painful weird looking as it was shaped like a perfect belt around my torso left side only and left a few scars. My mom and my doctor were both stumped since I never had the c.pox at all.
11262,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yep I got mine shortly after turning 50. The reaction sucked but it will be worth it not to get shingles.
11265,Shingles vaccine experience: My paternal grandfather had polio as a child. His post syndrome was a constant shake in his hands and it got worse as he tired. He was emphatic about vaccines.
11266,Has anyone under 60 been able to receive the RSV vaccine?: I received it because I was pregnant. You can also get it for that reason too between 3236weeks gestation. It significantly reduces the babies risk of hospitalization if obtained during pregnancy. I assume it provides me with some amount of protection as well. It was honestly easier than the flu shot certainly better than TDap.
11268,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Oh god yeah those suck. I had reconstructive surgery after I basically dusted my 5th metacarpal side of my hand gets those nerve itches sometimes. It is the same side that I broke my armwrist though so I can usually phantom scratch further up. Eases it a bit. Definitely on the shingles vaccine. Not trying to go through all that. Lol.
11270,My sister has the vaccine twice and has had shingles for the last 5 weeks. She underwent lymphoma treatment last year. Was Not chemo but a successful targeted treatment. Her Doc is amazed that she has shingles.
11271,I did not experience pain with the Shingles vaccine shots.
11272,I have had shingles multiple times since age 5 after getting CP at age 6 mo. I got Hep B vaccine in my 20s and it initiated a shingles outbreak both times. Got shingles vaccine and had a mast cell rxn. 2nd vaccine was fine though. Good luck
11277,I need to vent. I thought I was doing better gradually over the past year and a half but I am getting so much worse this past 2 months. The breast pain this week is indescribable and disabling. My clitoris is shrunken pale with no erection and almost no sensation. I am forcing a numb orgasm as I think the use it or lose it mantra for menopause is true and I want to keep blood flow going but cannot feel any pleasure. I have lost all body odor again all sweat lip and eye moisture is gone. Ears are incredibly itchy and flaking. I am getting shingles and hives again. I am now so worried about the rest of my body the things I cannot see. I am getting crippling headaches and headrushes. This is a new problem. I am not dehydrated so maybe I am still salt wasting? This little pill does so much to every organ I do not know where to begin. According to this paper 63 women were given spironolactone for 6 months. 38 of them still had effects 33.7 months after stopping. My GP told me all of my current problems are just coincidences as spiro would be out of my system in a few hours I accepted this incompetence at first she just wanted me out the door. But since then I have spoken to more doctors and seen their faces change when they hear the dose I was given and I am filled with rage for the Dr. who gave me it. He must have known and just did not warn me because he assumed it would go away when I stopped. And the thing is I cannot find that many people who are suffering as I am. Almost everybody on spiro has these exact sides to some degree but they really do bounce back in a few weeks or months when they get off of it. I just have not. And I am not alone but I have not found a single recovery story. I wonder if the women in this study actually went back to normal after the 3 years. I wonder if they woke up chemically castrated by it but persevered for the study. Only one paper I have found even bothers to ask participants about sexual disfunction in females and there is no follow up. There is some women on propecia help who got messed up by spiro too but no updates. I have found one woman who has not had libido for 12 years from taking it for 6 months. I feel so alone and frightened about what damage is really happening to my body.
11280,Shingles vaccine: That is good to hear I am prepared for the arm pain of course but I am just giving my family the heads up that I might be a little more lethargic on Thursday than usual.
11281,"Pneumonia vaccine: My grandma, who is in her 70s, received her pneumonia vaccine a week ago and has been experiencing some concerning symptoms ever since. She's been complaining of a persistent headache and nausea, which she didn't have before getting the shot. I'm worried about her and wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction to the pneumonia vaccine. About me: I haven't had the pneumonia vaccine yet but seeing my grandma's reaction has made me hesitant. I want to hear about others' experiences before deciding whether to get the vaccine myself. ---"
11282,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Vaccineassociated rash does happen between 15 of the time. Are you in pain? You can ask your doctor about pain treatment options if you are.
11287,Shingles shot?: i do not have personal experience with shingles but my mom's neighbour down the street had recurring shingles. it would knock her out for weeks and she had constant postpain. it caused nerve damage if i remember correctly. she was pretty much bedridden for two years. my mom used to basically make all of her meals and clean her house because she straight up just could not. shingles is no joke if you are in a group suggested to get a vaccine which afaik people with CD are according to my spouse who has it you absolutely should.
11291,: This is horrible and unexcusable. I refused it I did get the vaccine one and that did not agree with me either. That medical intervention is a killer and those labs that made it should be sued and closed. I am glad I did not take it and will NEVER take any mRNA shots. New Zealand where I currently live threatened everyone to take it is all they offered until the vaccine but it came near the end. I call New Zealand the death country. poutingface
11292,RSV vaccine: Ours got it at his 1 month appointment. He was fussy for one day but otherwise fine. To me it was important to get it before the holidays because it is the number one because of hospitalization of babies under one year.
11303,30YO with facial shingles first time: I think the Shingrix has made them milder but there is probably a good bit of hitting them early with Valtrex too. The S4 outbreak was scabbed within 5 days of starting it 7 days after they started. I have been telling EVERYBODY to take it as soon as you are 50  hubby poopooed the idea and last June he FAFO'd One LITTLE spot on his ribs was basically manflu. He asked me if there was not a shot for it and I notified him that ship had sailed already lol He is a Navy veteran and was NOT amused.  I am on Tecfidera have been for nearly 5 years now. Lesion free so if doc will keep me in prescriptions for Valtrex I will live. I do not want to change DMTs if I do not have to. I gave myself generic copaxone shots for 6 months before failing off spectacularly. Tell your sister another MSer said hi
11306,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was both I caught it between the first and second doses of the vaccine since its several years between the two. I only ever had like 12 pox spots so it was super mild thanks to the vaccine but I had it. It lasted several weeks though because the doctor kept misdiagnosing it as scabies and then was confused when that awful lotion did not work but doubled down on it anyways. I did not spread it to my class even though I went to school sick with it for like two weeks so I guess that is a testament to how good the vaccine is even if it was not perfect for me. It also created problems for me when I went to middle school because I never got the second dose no need but it was so rare for someone to have had one dose of the vaccine and chicken pox that they did not believe my parents when they tried to bar me entry to 6th grade for not having the second dose. It was eventually resolved I think by filing a religious exemption form because apparently my medical records were not good enough. Born 1997 yes I know I Am on the cusp and am just as likely to be Gen Z as I am to be a millenial
11308,If I had not been vaccine to the max I would have probably DIED when I got Covid19 instead of having NO SYMPTOMS while having a CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER Same with getting a MILD CASE OF SHINGLES instead of a HORRIFIC OUTBREAK because I had the Shingles vaccine JustSoYaKnow
11309,Shingles vaccine: I had it and my husband did not. He got shingles and is still struggling with after effects six months later.
11312,My doctor OB did not really reccomend any vaccines other than tdap. During my own research I found information about flu covid and rsv vaccines being good too. I brought it up to my OB and she said it should be okay to take those. She did not really know what the rsv vaccine was. I got my rsv had to call around to find it and pay out of pocket and felt really good at the time but now I see it might be linked to preterm labour and low birth weight. I am really worried I kind of dug myself in a hole by doing my own research and got things that might not even be needed. I do not really know how bad rsv is as I am a first time mom. I am wondering if I should have just went with OB reccomendations and got tdap only. None of my pregnant friends heard about the rsv shot either.
11314,Shingles: I Am so sorry that you have shingles. It is truly so awful. I got shingles shortly after my second egg retrieval. I remember getting the call that our only embryo was aneuploid while I was in excruciating pain. It seems like IVF causes the perfect storm of stress and hormones to trigger shingles. Its interesting because I also had just done the MDL protocol before getting shingles too. Hoping that you can get some rest and recover soon
11315,I got shingles on my mons pubisI guess its rare?: I Have had shingles before and it felt like my skin was dipped in acid and then set on fire. I Am glad you seemingly do not have it because that would hurt so bad
11316,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1971 Sent home one day in the first grade when my teacher noticed blisters starting to form on my scalp. Got shingles in high school. SUUUUUCKED.
11317,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Believe me its better than getting Shingles.
11319,"Update: I'm the woman who fell and broke my arm last month.: You poor thing! Happy birthday anyway. Everything is temporary, thank goodness. One day you'll be talking about this in past tenses. For now, milk the sympathy you can get out of the whole situation because you deserve it, the moment you feel childish, you'll be over the worst of it. Until then, I hope you feel better soon."
11322,Weekly Small Talk Thread  December 01 2023: For us the actual injection hurt. No effect after that but we both looked at each other and said Ow. Shin gri x.
11323,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Had a college professor who got shingles mid term. When he did make it in to teach he could barely move leaned against the desk stated sitting as extremely painful took several months to recover. A friend's mom has scars from shingles and almost died from it. I got vaccine last year at 53 this year hubby 57 finally got his. Our oldest will have to get it as well in a decade or so.
11326,Shingles Sucks: I had a mild case where it followed the T12 dermatome. My doctor told me a story where he had a patient who had shingles that went into his rectum. Very rare and very  painful.
11329,FML... I got shingles: I did at my PCP appointment in November. It is two shots. Getting my second in January
11330,I am in the midst of getting diagnosed but I have got many of the typical symptoms of lipoedema bilateral fat buildup on thighs and upper arms pretty intense bruising nonresponsive to dietexercise circulation issues etc. For a long time I experienced pain at the most minor of touch especially around the thighs. In high school my friends and family always joked about how extreme my reactions to bumping into things was since I sometimes reacted like I would been shot. This was a constant of my life since I would hit puberty. As an aside my pain tolerance threshold is otherwise fairly high. Example When I had shingles it barely tickled...so I was convinced I could not possibly have shingles lol. I frequently do not notice other injuries until well after the fact. Sometime in my late 20s the extreme pain reaction stopped. I just noticed its absence one day and I could not tell you what is different between then and now. I still bruise extremely easily and have all the other issues which is why I am pursuing a diagnosis. Every great once in a while I will have a disproportionate response to gently bumping into something but it is no longer a constant issue like it was when I was growing up. I have not read of anything similar in medical literature or personal anecdote so I was curious if anyone else had a similar experience to mine. Thanks
11332,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: I would rather feel tired from a vaccine for a few weeks than a week or two from covid or permanent damage and pain from shingles.
11336,41 and got Shingles: Had it at about the same age as you. For me the cure was worse than the disease. Steroids gave me insomnia I did not sleep for four days straight.
11340,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Never went to a party but I have got 2 brothers. Older brother got it from a friend at school '92 I believe he had a BAD case he had papules in his nose ears and mouth. Passed it to me was not nearly as bad as his and I passed it to little brother who had a VERY mild case. Of the 3 of us little brother ended up with shingles twice in his teens. Mom suspects it was due to only having a very mild case of CP.
11342,Shingles vaccine: I get a weird case of shingles its not as painful or scary as others but its debilitating in its own right. The first time I got it I had taken the old shingles vaccine. As soon as I could I got the Shingrix series. I still get my version of shingles occasionally but I Am convinced the vaccines keep it from being bad.
11343,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Shingles was easily the worst pain in my life. It was the most miserable month of my life and then the next month was just merely shitty.
11345,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the chickenpox vaccine I got chickenpox I got shingles all before 5 years old
11349,Late March 2024 Baby RSV Vaccine during Pregnancy?: I got it for free in February too. I think fewer people than expected are getting it and so if you do not get it will expire. Tip usually I get jabs in my left arm. But now that I sleep on my left a lot I find its better to get the jab in my right arm. I got TDAP in my left and slept horribly for 2 days so I learned my lesson.
11352,Shingles vaccine: I had no bad side effects from getting the two shots. I thought it was because I already had the shingles so it made the shot a breeze.
11356,Shingles vaccine: I had the shingles vaccine. There were two separate shots I want to say 2 or 3 weeks apart. I had zero side effects which is unusual for me
11358,New Shingrix data demonstrate 100 vaccine efficacy in the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over in China: There have been reports a historic study of people having the shin gri x vaccine then going outbreak free for 2 years. Personally and this is purely anecdotal so worth precisely nothing but since having the chickenpox vaccine my prod rome syndromes have massively reduced and I have not had an outbreak in 9 months whereas previously I had an outbreak every 2 months.
11363,ON got my RSV vaccine: I did not have a reaction to mine either. Got in the middle of the work day and finished my 12 hr shift without any extra tiredness or anything.
11364,Shingles vaccine: I had both with no issues. No sore arm or side effects.
11365,My doctor said my EBV was retriggered from the vaccine dating back to when my symptoms first started. Moderna 1 2. Covid 4 times. I Am 51 and cannot take the shingles vaccine. My doctor says it will only make my current condition worse. Wish I never got vaccine
11366,My Dad died suddenly in November after his booster he was only 74 of a heart attack. I had 2pfizers have had repeated shingles neuropathy pain CFS in my 40s. We were poisoned. My Dad was wonderful an assistant head teacher talented musician artist my heart broke too
11368,2 doctors gave me 2 different diagnosis and I am lost.: Shingles almost always is limited to one side of the body. For example my shingles were on my left side lower back butt cheek entire thigh. They very rarely cross over the center of the body. Someone who understands this better will likely explain. Or Google it. The doctor is very uninformed. Remember 50 of doctors graduated at the bottom half of their class.
11372,I Am the same way and since I was only down for around 12 hrs with the first one I asked the nurse to do a COVID booster at the same time as the second one. Wisely I took her advice and only got the Shingles one that day.
11373,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Goddamn shingles. Worst I have ever felt when sick.
11374,Shingles shot: I got shingles in December 2005 right before Christmas and had to spend several days in the hospital. It scarred the tip of my nose and inside my eye. Thankfully it was not incredibly painful... I have heard how painful shingles can be. I think mine was caught just as it was beginning during a routine doctor's visit which allowed treatment to start right away perhaps mitigating the effects it had on me. Was released from the hospital on Christmas day. You can get shingles again apparently between 1.29.6 of people get it again even if you have had it. So get the shots.
11376,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I tried to get the shingles vaccine early six weeks before I turned 50. They would not do it.
11380,"Prednisone and vaccine efficiency/risk?: So I started pred at 30 mg 4 days ago but GI also wanted me to get shingles vaccine as new meds I'll be on rinvoq increase chance for me to get it. However the nurse called today who was to do it said being on pred can make vaccine less effective or even result in me getting what it's supposed to prevent. Not sure why GI didn't say to wait a couple days and do vaccine first before starting prednisone, should I be worried? Should I delay vaccine longer and wait for prednisone to be more out of my system?"
11381,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: Yes. My 25 weeker has followed the typical newborn vaccination schedule. I Have pushed for everything including RSV.
11382,"Second shingles shot...how bad is it?: I got my first shot several months ago and finally remembered to get the second one today. I'm reading online that the second one can be brutally painful to the point that people don't want to get it. It's worth it to me because shingles is MUCH worse, but I'd like to know what to expect. How bad was your first shot? How bad was your second by comparison? Fwiw, my first was *really* painful for a solid week, so I'm a little worried about the next 7 or so days.."
11386,LOL. I got them both in the same area too. For some reason I feel more pain on my right side and it causes a vasovagal response and I will pass out. But these two injections still do not come close to the Shingrix.
11389,Recurring shingles on face and eye.: I had it on my face and eye and was put on a high dose prophylactic of the acyclovir for a good year. It was one pill 3x a day. My ophthalmologist also told me to avoid the sun  stress but to also keep track to see if maybe my menstrual cycle was a trigger. I recently had an outbreak this time on my leg and was told by the Costco pharmacist and my immunologist I could get the vaccine 3 months after my outbreak since that is when the immunity starts to wear off. I am in the US and because I am not old enough insurance will not cover it so it is like 200shot here and it is 2 doses. I would definitely get seen by an ophthalmologist immediately if you have blisters forming. I almost lost vision in my eye from it and was told to immediately go to the ER if I ever had any recurrence.
11392,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I Have had shingles. Over my eye. It sucked I was so sick and so worried Id go blind. Fuck that woman. I am so grateful children now do not have to go through chicken pox or risk shingles with the vaccine. Omg. This post made me so angry
11394,It is also the reactivated chicken pox virus that is usually triggered by a weakened immune system. Hence the surge of shingles since the covid jabs. Does the vaccine prevent you getting shingles or are you more likely to get it like the covid jabs?
11395,Shingles vaccine: My wife had it on her face. The dr told her if it spread to her eye she was in danger of losing vision or even blindness. Get the shot. Its not a joke.
11399,If alphagal is in vaccines and can because an allergic response then it can because the allergy to begin with. They want you to just blame ticks.: Did you read the link you supplied? A patient with alpha gal allergy presented with anaphylaxis after receiving zoster vaccine. The person already had A GS prior to the vaccine.
11400,shingles on cibinqo: Shin gri x gave my friend flu like symptoms. I may have felt a little tired and took a nap for the day.
11401,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Have you been vaccinated against chicken pox? Are you 100 you did not have even a mild case of chicken pox as a child? Twice I had it. My worst case had 6 sores.
11405,Thank you Saw the rashes shingles herpes outbreak with clients after the 1st shot or the flu shot Poor souls do not have any idea what they have done to themselves I pray for their souls
11407,Getting my first Shingles shot today: My second was a bitch Glad its over and done with.
11408,26f and first shingles episode. Is that normal?: Now that you mentioned it my eczema also got worse after I got Covid too Interesting correlation.
11409,So basically I am in a predicament where I might not have insurance due to my controlling parents. For context my parents are super conservative Protestant Christians and tend to be controlling. My current insurance is abouut to end this month and I am supposed to get a new insurance in january but my parents refused to give me my current insurance cardinformation so i had to directly call them for my insurance information with this info i was able to get my first dose of the hpv vaccine and seek mental help for my anxiety something that my parents were aganist now that my current insurance is going to expire I will have to go through the process of trying to get my information for my new insurance but this time i do not think it will work because my new insurance is provided by my moms hospital compared to my current insurance where it was medicad what makes this situation worse is that I have a upcoming appointment in jan to get my 2nd dose of my hpv vaccine and a upcoming appointment in december to get medication for my anxiety  and my current insurance will end this monthsomething i just recently figured out. I Am just so frustrated. Even into adulthood I am 18 I still feel controlled and limited due to my parents controlling actions. I do not know what to do if I cannot get access to my new insurance I do not know if I will be able to get my 2nd dose of my HPV shot I do not know if my impacted wisdom teeth will get worse and ruin my other teeth without any treatment.
11411,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I definitely had the classic flu. When the Shingles started unknown. The nerve pain began 7 days later. Had a bad cough sore throat stuffy nose post nasal drip muscle aches loss of appetite and coughing up gunk. At one point I wondered if it was bronchitis but never in a million years did I expect to finish with Shingles.
11412,A few months later my husband got a routine blood tests. His PSA was 9 so they recommended he get image tests. They found prostate tumor and a stomach tumor that was not there before he got vaccinated. He had imaging done prior to Covid. He then also got shingles.
11413,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Ugh I got it in my damned eye when I was 39 bad enough to get hospitalized for a week. It was about a month before I got married and it was an absolute miracle I did not still look like a zombie in the photos. It also permanently damaged my eye and messed up my vision. Just the absolute worst but last time I requested a vaccine they said not until 55 I think. Makes no sense everyone I know who is had shingles was in their 20s 30s or 40s.
11414,"During a lapse in insurance, brother [28] discovered he has leukemia after reacting to Covid Vaccine. What services could provide help for him?: Last time I posted in this sub-reddit, I recieved sound advice from amazing people to remove my fears of the vaccine. I am coming back to seek additional advice for my brother after a series of extremely chaotic events have unfolded. Please forgive me if the information I provide below is difficult to understand, I am basing this off of the information passed down from doctors to my parents and then to me. It started with an ingrown hair under his armpit that seemed like a small irritation at the time. He recieved his first vaccine without thinking anything of it, but to later find out that he has leukemia. His immune system was compromised so he had nothing to combat the vaccine, or the irritation that would later turn into sepsis. In a way it was a GOOD thing that his body reacted so terribly because if it hadn't, he would have never had a blood test to learn that he has cancer, and who knows how long it would have been before he knew!! Anyways, he has been at the hospital all week and we think he still has another month to go. He has been diagnosed with acute leukemia, sepsis, and now shingles. He is not doing well. He is a really great person. He supports his girlfriend and has taken on the father role to her son, and doesnt think twice about supporting the two of them. He is one of those guys that people easily gravitate to, for my whole life I have never met one single person that has ever had anything even remotely negative to say about him. He JUST got a new job and so his insurance was switching over, so currently he has zero coverage. Due to chemo he will most likely lose his job as well, and shouldnt be working anyways while going through treatment... Are there any services that can help him right now? I plan on calling around on Monday but in the meantime, if anyone can provide suggestions or speak from personal experience, it would mean a lot. I'm his sister and I feel helpless so really anything I can do to help him and our family, I want to know.. Thank you."
11417,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles a few years ago when I was 35. I got 2 patches on my thigh close to my knee and then one on my inner thigh. They say it sits and hides in your spin when its dormant so that dictates the general area of the body that it will appear I Am not sure how true that all is. I felt burning in my hips before I saw the rash patches appear. Its uncomfortable but as long as it is not a severe case it should be completely gone in 23 weeks. I have not had a reoccurrence as of yet. At the time my job had completely run me ragged and that was my reward. Moral of the story do not save those vacation days to the end of the year use them when you need a break seriously.
11418,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Correction: Colonoscopies are awesome! Sure, the prep means you poop some, but the actual provider will be the deepest, most restful nap you've had in years. Heck, I'd go again once a month, if I could!"
11421,Missed Opportunity?: I pushed for the shingles vaccine before starting my DMT because of this. It was very hard to get it approved and it delayed my treatment by like 6 months. And in that time I had a relapse. So positives and negatives to both I guess
11427,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Got chickenpox from my mom because of her shingles facewithrollingeyes
11428,Shingles vaccine experience: My second shot was not worse.
11430,Student Constantly Asks About Word Count Other Minor Details for Graduate Assignments:  recovering from shingles ugh. this sounds awful. i had this stressrelated just before i had to fly 24 hours straight ... misery i hope you are feeling better soon.
11431,I m a 55 year old female that is currently 5 weeks po stop. 10 days after my surgery I noticed my back was itching pretty bad. I had some small welts and I thought I was having an allergic reaction of some sort since it was below my surgical incisions. I tried using hydro cortisone cream for a few days and even had the PA look at it when I got my stitches out. They didn t think it was an allergic reaction and advised following up with my Primary care physician. I went 2 days later when Ben yd rl and the hydro cortisone cream weren t work. Turns out it was shingles. I was told this can happen after the stress of surgery. I ended up having to take 10 days of antiviral medication 5 times a day. The side effects were AWFUL nausea headache chills loss of appetite etc. on top of the itching and trying to recover from 4 procedures done during my rotator cuff surgery. Posting as a PSA had I known that stress on your body after surgery can activate this dormant virus I would have had the shingles vaccine before the surgery. This is really the last thing you need when trying to recover.
11434,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: My baby was born Oct 28th in Ontario and he received the RSV vaccine a week later at our family doctors office.
11435,"After receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, I developed a headache and nausea that lasted for a few days. Has anyone else had similar symptoms after their J&J shot? Is it normal or should I be concerned?"
11448,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I hear you as I am sure we all have severe PTSD from Shingles I pray I never get this again I know it is recommended I just have to look into it some more and of course alternate food sources that can keep the lysine intake high. I love almonds too which are high in arginine. Honestly I know why this happened to me as I was under tremendous stress for an extended period of time. I will continue taking my vitamin D daily no matter what as well.
11452,Guess it just depends. I am 65 so receive a flu vaccine with more depth less breadth and there go the next 24 hours Covid and shingles meh maybe a little sore at the injection sight. Not different strokes but different reactions for different folks.
11454,Shingles x3?: I have had them 4X all on different dermasomes. Last time was 3 years after the Shingrix series... this last time was milder than the 3rd I DO NOT KNOW if it is because of the vaccine ir because I got Valtrex this time maybe both. Good luck this shit sucks
11459,I let my dr talk me into a flu shot once...I regret it. I got bells palsyshingles and ITP hospitalized a few times a couple in ICU and outpatient for a yr or so then remission 5yrs then hospital and outpatient another yr or so. Never again.
11463,Shingles week 29: Thank you for the well wishes The doc said up to three days and I Am on day 2 right now. She said the face is the worst to get it because there is a bunch of nerves which man she was not wrong. I am thankful she checked inside my eye and I had no sores in my eye just the eye lids. She said THAT would require an ER visit. Right now battling an elevated temperature and grateful to have a wonderful husband make me homemade soup and have popsicles on hand. I Am sorry it sounds like you have gone through shingles before too. Its definitely not ideal but I Am sure meds and tons of rest will get me through.
11464,Shingles vaccine: Most painful events in my life Childbirth Gum transplant Shingles
11468,Had the vaccine shingles vaccine preventively years ago on the advice of our pharmacist because my brother and niece had shingles which turned out not to be. After the vaccine I have had shingles dozens and dozens of times it has destroyed my health.
11471,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: As an elder millennial I remember multiple arguments with my doctor trying to get the vaccine at 25 because Id never had chick pox or the vaccine parents did not want to get me that vaccine because it was too new and they were being cautious. Doctor insisted I must have just forgotten and to ask my parents again. I maintained that my parents TOLD me Id never had it and my older sister had it at 17 for the first time. She insisted I must have caught it from my sis then but lived with different parents when they divorced so we did not see each other when she had it. After several frustrating discussions she finally gave in and did titer testing checking for antibodies which came back with NONE. I did the vaccine series and was then told the downfall is now I can contract shingles. Oh well.
11483,Mild shingles case after 7 days of the first rash appearing. First pic is right leg second is right side of lower back and the third is right upper thigh. Feeling lucky that it is already looking better and the pain is pretty much gone. Is it normal for it to resolve so fast?: From everything I have learned since Monday. At doctor appointments and my own reading. Non textbook shingles does happen. Just not every medical profession will acknowledge it being non textbook. I have had 2 PAs who examined me tell me it looks like bilateral shingles and I have had a nurse who I spoke to on the phone only tell me it is impossible. I have been calling it atypical shingles for lack of a better term. I have it on both elbows apparently. My right elbow is improving and my left elbow is just starting to break out. They only cultured my right elbow today at my second opinion appointment. But I was told to treat both elbows with the RX topical steroid and manuka honey. About a week after noticing my right elbow and 2 days after starting meds. I was also vaccinated in 2021 due to cancer.
11489,Shingles exposure?: This. I got shingles at 11 years old. It was very painful and actually left me with permanent nerve damage. I would not risk it.
11491,And you were smart to get the shingles shot. My husband got shot 1 about a year ago and found out a month ago that he never got the second. And before he could get shot 2? Got a case of shingles. And it is no fun
11492,Shingles vaccine: I had no adverse reaction to either of them
11502,Shingles shot: my arm hurt that was all. Get it though. A friend of the family went blind in one eye due to shingles.
11503,"what side effects should I expect from prednisone?: I've finished taking prednisone almost 2 weeks ago, what should I expect to happen? I have some red stuff all over my skin that it's itchy(they ain't mosquito bites), as If I had some allergy.... I've been taking prednisone for 3 or 4 months, started with 60 and going down 5 by 5, week by week.??"
11505,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I just found out about internal shingles.... Nope. Mother had it on her face it involved the corner of her right eye. I had her go to a different er because they kept telling her it was not that. I was right and that doctor nay he get scabies that cannot be cured
11506,41 and got Shingles: Wife got them as a teen. Wondered why it felt like she broke all her ribs.
11520,RSV vaccine baby must be 5 kg? QC: We managed to get the shot for under 5 kg
11521,Shingles Is NO Joke: Fuck everything about shingles. I had it a decade ago and still get shooting pain through my lower arm
11522,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: My son 21 got shingles earlier this year. I really thought it was poison ivy but the location was bizarre like on his back almost under the arm pit. He had been doing yard work and I thought maybe he brushed up against the ivy in our yard. My husband has been hit numerous times. Part of it looked like a streak up the shoulder. I mean it really did not look like my case of shingles which was just a patch of spots. The CNP said she was pretty certain it was shingles though and treated it as such. I got my first shingles shot last Tuesday.
11523,I am hoping someone in this community might have some insight into the symptoms my mother is experiencing. Thus far no one has been able to figure out the because. I am a nurse but my expertise is in Cardiology so I can summarize recent events well but am at a loss on how to proceed from here and am not having much success with her PCP. PMH 68 year old with hypertension hyperlipidemia migraines anxiety depression left hip replacement in 62024 April 2024 developed L foot drop which she attributed to hip severe osteoarthritis planned hip replacement in June May 2024 developed intermittent lisp which has very slowly worsened and now progressed to profound dysarthria June 2024 underwent planned L hip replacement July 2024 had post op ortho appointment L foot drop had not improved or resolved so a lumbar MRI and EMG were ordered. At this point she was able to use a cane inside her home no longer required the walker Early August 2024 admitted for severe nausea hyponatremia and hypokalemia later attributed to HCTZ electrolytes replaced nausea resolved once normalized discharged home but just these two days were a significant setback from a strength perspective. From this point forward she required a walker a cane is not enough. August 12 saw new PCP for the first time who was concerned about speech and symptoms ordered stat head MRI which was done the following day. It showed old strokes which were news to us Mild chronic microvascular ischemic change and sequela of remote infarcts nothing acute but admission was recommended on the 14thbecause my mom thought her weakness was worse and her PCP thought her speech was worse over the phone thought it best to expedite neuro workup. Up until this point she was able to climb stairs slowly and carefully her house is 2 stories and could shower in her bathroom which has a shower stall and grab bars. I Am not sure exactly when but around this time she began to report hand weakness described as inability to open a chapstick and swallowing changes which she described as discomfort on the R side of her throat. Her midAugust admission notes state intermittent numbness and tinglingweakness in bilateral hands which she reported had developed since earlier August admission. Mid August 2024 admission with Neuro workup copy and pasting pieces of neuro consult below Patient was seen by neurology who noted upper and lower motor neuron findings suspicious for a motor neuronopathy. Neurology performed extensive workup including brain MRI which was negative for acute stroke though did show prior remote infarcts. Subsequent contrast enhanced brain MRI showed no evidence of intracranial metastasis. CT angiogram head and neck were negative. Cervical spine MRI showed degenerative changes in cervical spine with osteophyte complexes at C56 and C67 which resulted in mild central stenosis and moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing but cervical cord was of normal caliber and signal. Neurology did not feel that this would explain the patient's symptoms. The patient did have recent outpatient EMG due to left foot drop. Neurology advised repeat EMG to address patient's current areas of complaints. Lots of labs sent out phosphorus RF lyme titer B12 within normal fyou acetylcholine receptor binding Ab send out to test for myasthenia gravis fyou MUSK Ab send out fyou Lambert Eaton Ab panel send out fyou paraneoplastic Ab panel send out fyou spep upep send out fyou ANA send out Only abnormal results ANA Screen IFA Positive ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Mitotic spindle fibers ANA titer 1320 ANA Pattern Cytoplasmic fine speckled Ultimately thought to be motor neuronopathy My mom is a terrible historian and easily hysterical and dramatic at baseline so its difficult for me to sort out reality from drama with her. Its hard to say if her symptoms change from one day to the next and how quickly they are progressing because she cannot really give a straight answer. I will say that since her last admission and rehab stay she can no longer manage stairs of any kind and is living on one floor of her home. She cannot stand long enough to shower. Vaccines most recently in the fall 2023 covid flu shingles spaced out per pharmacist Including this because she is questioning vaccine injury but her symptoms did not seem to start until six months later She lives alone since my dad passed away in 2020 and is not doing well keeping up with maintaining her house which I did not truly appreciate until the last few months. Just last weekend I noticed significant mold in her basement but I do not know when it appeared. It was light gray not black from what I could see. I have not seen mold in the rest of the house but that does not mean its not there. She lives in an area with high iron content in water has a full house filtration system. She does not drink or cook with that water but has bathed in it and done laundry in it since 2000. I do not think it has been tested for any abnormalities. I Am wondering if she has an autoimmune disorder causing neurological symptoms if this is strictly neurological or something else I Am not aware of. I Am happy to provide any other info I can get my hands on if there is something I should have included. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
11525,Hey everyone this might be a long post so I apologise in advance especially if this is not formatted correctly as I am on my phone. I was finally diagnosed last month after experiencing a relapse in August that showed new lesions in my brain it is to the point where I did not require a lumbar puncture or further testing. This is after annual MRI's dating back to 2020 when I had optic neuritis. Long story short I finally got to see a neurologist and they pushed for Ocrevus however they neglected to state all possible outcomes including the cancer risk. He said The most you can get is shingles. Tysabri tends to because chest infections and other issues but not Ocrevus. There is also no risk of PML with Ocrevus whatsoever. which is wrong and I expressed this but he went on this long winded talk about how long he is been a neurologist and all the old medications used for treating MS and the issues with them. He did not say anything further about Ocrevus though. He basically did not want to hear what I had to say and also claimed all of the pain pins and needles numbness heat intolerance and other things I have been experiencing since August are musculoskeletal and not MSMS related. Anyway I did not know about the cancer risk whatsoever until a few days after my appointment when I did research as what he had said did not sit well with me. So I have PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome and that puts me at higher risk of certain types of cancer as is both of my maternal grandparents had cancer one of them passing a few years ago from it. My mother has also has had begnin lumps in her chest and it is proven that Ocrevus does increase the risk of breast cancer in women. I cannot speak of my paternal side father was adopted so genetics are a bit unclear there. However once I learnt of this cancer risk I emailed the neurologist weeks ago now but I have not heard back. I got my partner to read over the email before I sent it to make sure I was not being passive aggressive as I had to address some other things too. I mostly did this because I wanted to address the cancer risk and subtly point out the lack of informed consent as he did not provide all relevant information etc. I missed a call yesterday from the hospital's infusion lounge. I assume trying to set me up to get the first of my first twopart dose. I did not call them back because now I am thinking I need a second opinion from another neurologist or something similar but the issue there is I live in what is considered a rural area and there is not even a resident neurologist the one I saw comes down every two months and I do not see them again until late March and they are not going to be contactable at all in January. I am only 23 I do not know how long I will be on Ocrevus but I assume like with most medications that it is a case of the longer you are on it the higher the risk becomes. I tried to reach out to the MS foundation for my country specifically my state as I would kind of been allocated a nurse but with where I live they really do not seem to care nor be involved a great deal. Still I contacted the allocated nurse and esentially I was ignored. When I brought up all the pain and worsening symptoms with the heat I was literally told that I need to turn off a switch in your head because the MS nurse had previously lived with chronic pain for four years. The nurse said to just tell them when I start Ocrevus and that is it So I am wondering what everyone else was or has been told about the risks with Ocrevus? I had read both here and elsewhere that there is chest infections pneumonia UTI's and other things too. I have been stressing about this for a while now and I have not been able to talk to anyone about it beyond my partner. I am considering calling the MS servicefoundation based in the city same servicefoundation as the nurse allocated where I am currently but they have more people in the city and they seem to actually care to see if I can speak to anyone more knowledge about Ocrevus before I talk to the hospital's infusion lounge to organise things. I cannot really see any other neurologist as there is nothing available here the neurologist is locum and I did try to get moved in the process of awaiting an appointment but was told that the waitlists were too long. I would really appreciate everyone and anyone's input regarding this. Anyway I hope that everyone is looking after themselves during this holiday season. Thank you kindly for reading.
11527,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had the zaps and shocks too. They are horrific. They stopped around Day 17. Ice packs helped so much. Then severe neuropathic itching sets in. My doctor prescribed hydroxyzine 2 pm pill and bedtime pill for the itching until it got better. Its an itch you cannot get to because everything is numb. Your mom is so blessed to have you. I could not have gotten through shingles without my daughter and son. God Bless you both. Prayers.
11529,People who got Pfizer vaccine in Israel later developed shingles
11530,I guess results vary I can honestly tell you I had the shingles vaccine and had no issues at all. Maybe I was lucky. I know someone who was vaccine and got the shingles and suffered I mean suffered. So I think it is worth it to get the vaccine
11531,RSV Vaccine: Yes He did really well with it No side effects at all. Hopefully it helps him stay healthy andor fight it off if he gets RSV. Soooo much stuff gets passed around at daycare.
11532,Shingles vaccine: I Am 33 and I Have had it twice in the last 2 years. One time after I got covid 2nd time after I got a coldmight have been mild covid as my husband's work had a covid rampage and he got sick but no pos test both time was very mild a patch of itchy skin on my back and neck. I feel like i am gambling for the next time I get covid if Ill get a more severe case of shingles. But doc said no shingles vaccine for me yet.
11534,Listen to Roman The pain of shingles is beyond what most of us know I am vaccinated too
11535,Shingrix question: I am 38 just got 1st shin gri x today at Cost co cheapest place c uz I thought I would have to pay out of pocket luckily insurance fully covered it I had prescription. Arm is sore but other than that no issues. totally worth it to not deal w shingles again I am going to. I would follow up with your doctor about your concerns and see what they say in my experience Reddit is not a good place for sound medical advice IIII
11539,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Same My toddler was sick for 2 weeks but I was sick for a month and ended up hospitalized with heart issues from the virus. I was so happy to get the RSV vaccine for the baby and also for me
11543,Shingles: Hi I just wanted to say that I Am so sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately I think its up to the doctor what the clinic was comfortable with. Its crazy to see how several of us have gotten shingles I actually got shingles too after my second Ivf retrieval after which I had severe OHSS and internal bleeding which took 6 weeks to recover from. I got my period the same week so called my doc to see if they were work comfortable with me going in because I wanted to be respectful that it is contagious to those without the immunity. I had two appointments that week one at a bread place to check a cyst I have hopefully hormone ride induced I Have had one before. They refused to see me understandably because they also treat cancer. Shockingly my Ivf doc was okay with me coming in if I kept it covered and felt okay moving forward with my cycle. I had my retrieval this morning. Praying the drugs and shingles do not impact my results Its probably most optimal to do a retrieval when your body is not fighting something off if that gives you any comfort. I was not even considering another retrieval but in the moment went for it and probably needed that to go through with it because I was so traumatized by my last recovery experience.
11544,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Yeah well I got shingles after I got COVID the first time. At 38. It sucks
11545,16 F shingles firsttimer. any advice for dealing with this?: You can take OTC painkillers like ibuprofen in the meantime. Take max dose allowed if low dose does not give you enough relief. I Am really sorry you have been going through all this. I too never had chickenpox but got the vaccine. I Am luckier in the sense that I Am older in my 40s so doctors did not rule out shingles. The pain was awful. I was in tears too before painkillers. Keep taking antiviral. I started on it later than Id wish but it still helped. Rash was still developingkeep popping up on my body when I started taking antiviral and I can see a huge difference between the new rash and old rash started before antiviral. The afterantiviral rash hurt less no oozing and hopefully little or no scarring. Good luck with your recovery.
11548,: Yes he had and he has already said many times he feels lied to let down as well as angry Additionally during a time while he was unaware what was going on and still pushing the vaccine he mentioned that he is now on blood pressure medicine. It took him quite some time to realize that may have been from the vaccine and what was actually going on. I give him credit for once he was awake. He went full force and trying to have others obtain this knowledge.
11549,First time getting singles on my forehead eyelid and scalp any tips for face wash and healing?: I am sorry you are going through it. I had it in early July then PHN set in August. I had it up to my eye nose and side of my head. It was the absolute most excruciating thing I have ever felt. Every 45 minutes I would have an attack that would last 5 minutes at a time feeling like my eye was being gouged out of my head with a scalding hot metal spike. All you can do is sit down and take the pain. I started feeling hopeless at a certain point where I could not sleep or anything out of fear of waking up to an attack which is what I woke up to every time I tried to sleep. I went 6 days without sleeping. Your mind starts to give out and you just want it to end. Every day though the attacks would get further and further apart and I started to get some relief. I believe the gabopentin takes a while to start working and I used capsaicin cream which burns when you first put it on but a few minutes later it starts to dull the pain. I still have nerve damage on the side of my face and eye and I am still on gabopentin. I have a neurologist appointment in a couple weeks and I guess they can do some things to help. When I take a shower I actually use swimming goggles to protect my eye and that seems to help with that. I wish you good health Hope you feel better. Just remember that every day it gets a little better after that 1st hell week. I know it is distressing and I was a person at first that almost did not even want to know much about it. Focus on getting through the hard part and every minute that goes by is one less minute you have to experience it. Good luck to you Keep us posted on your progress
11551,I am so tired of shingles.: Any have the blisters on scalp? Mine were on left side of face and chest but all over middles of my skull. Its been horrific. This is week 5.
11553,So I woke up today feeling a little crummy kept sort of scratching a spot on my side near rib and I thought it was a bug bite but it kept getting bigger and bigger so I went to the urgent care and they said it COULD be a bug bite but said that was a common place for shingles. I am 39 so i am surprised BUT I did just get off steroids Prednisone about 2 weeks ago for bronchitis and I know steroids lower your immune system. I have noticed it spreading a bit and starting to burn some...but it does not look like most shingles pics I see online. Earlier Most recent picture. I Am still unsure but in the 2nd picture I feel like you can start to see a line of bumps? Maybe the nerve pathway. Anyways they sent me in for a prescription of valtrex cannot get it till morning but nothing else. Is there a creme or something I should use? Also I am TERRIFIED of going blind from it or getting it in my eye. The doctor said it usually sorta stays in one area In this case my right rib. She also said it generally only stays on one side of the body? Is this going to keep me home from work if I caught it early? Which I think I did since I did not notice anything yesterday. Also i am curious if something is messed up with my immune system now since I got his so young. I was just at the doctors for my checkup 6 months ago and everything was fine? I even got a bunch of immune testsauto immune just because i am a bit of a hypochondriac.
11556,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: It triggered some random immune response and caused a p soria tic arthritis flare which was 3 months of hell. I would never had p soria tic arthritis or any of its cousins before and my team of docs yes team suspected the tr if ect a was the trigger. My system just simply no ped the f out. I would not wish that on anyone
11557,Male 33 not currently smoker. At the hospital for wifes delivery baby was born yesterday and labored for 24 hours before csection. I Have gotten little sleep helping her and the baby. Before the csection I started to notice my throat hurting almost like snoring all night dry throat. MIL also mentioned her throat hurting. I am vaccinated on everything except RSV as it was not available. No fever or other symptoms. My question is can this just be from the dry cold air or should I be more concerned. I asked the nurses for a mask just in case.
11559,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I do not know what it does or does not do. All I know is I was in agony took it and the pain stopped within 30 minutes. It held off that pain for the full 10 days I had it. The pain felt like it was in my scalp at the top of my head rather than in my brain if that makes sense.
11560,"Shingles vaccine: second dose: I had a worse reaction to the first than the second. Sore arm for almost a full week with both, but much more fever, chills and muscle aches with shot #1 than #2."
11563,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I know someone that had it very close up their eyes. After vaccination. Luckily it did not spread because that would be terrible and I would not wish it on anyone.
11566,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Early 30s burning stinging and weeping sores on soft tissue in the underside of my arms and neck. It was painful and gross. Dr said stress could weaken my immune system enough reactivate the remnants of an old bout with chickenpox that lay dormant in my nerves.
11569,Shingles Vaccine: I was a lucky case. I normally do not get sick but I got really sick and had a big blotch on my forehead. Went to a clinic on day 2 I think and was immediately prescribed antivirals managed to get through in about a week. I had no idea it was shingles and I Am not someone who would normally seek medical advice no real reason. Anyway moral of the story is to reiterate if you get sick and get a blotch anywhere at the same time get it checked out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
11570,Me either. No reaction to other vaccines or the needles used. I thought that the syringe used for the shingles vaccine was going to go all the way through my arm. I could barely move that arm for days.
11571,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: No reaction to the Covid shots here and no reaction to the Shingles shot other than a sore arm on the first one. Maybe a little tired the day after like with a flu shot but not anything bad.
11573,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I got my vaccines as soon as I turned 50. Poked my husband to get it too. I was annoyed at my rother the other day who is 54 when he said he had not done it yet. The vaccine side effects do suck but so what.
11576,First shingles vaccine side effects: Yup. Mistake. I work out about 3 hours a day so am in decent shape but that combo laid me LOW
11579,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles is kind of like covid in that there is huge variance person to person on the severity of impact. I had shingles right around age 40 and it was definitely uncomfortable and probably took 3 weeks to resolve. But I was not in agony. I was able to wear clothes and work through it. My stepbrother got shingles and he was dealing with the phantom nerve issues well after a year of viral onset. His symptoms were brutal. And he is an otherwise healthy and athletic guy. You never know what camp you are going to be in so do not gamble and just get the vaccine You could save yourself a ton of misery.
11580,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had a very mild case as a kid. I think I had like 3 bumps and I did not realize what they were for a few days. I felt a bit shitty and those 3 bumps were itchy but that was it. I hope that was enough to keep me immune. Your story scares me a bit lol. I also find it odd as I am one of the unlucky ones who get frequent outbreaks of cold sores which is a related virus not the same though. I am surprised I did not get a worse case of chickenpox as it seems my immune system does a terrible job of keeping cold sores at bay.
11581,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in 96. I was vaccinated but somehow caught it anyway. I am still mad twenty years later.
11582,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I had shingles once. My wife was at the time an essential oils enthusiast. She put some Thieves essential oil on it. I was in a universe of pain for what seemed like an hour. Until I washed it with Dawn.
11584,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Glad you recovered. I am 55F and have not had the shingles shot but I suppose I need to. I have had the pneumonia and all the Covids they will give me. Never gotten more than a sore arm from a vaccine
11587,Shingles with newborn Hello 33f 54 165lbs Non smoker No current meds with a 10 week old baby. I went to the dermatologist about 10 days ago to check out a suspicious spot on lower armpit. No pain no itching just raised and flakey. She said she suspected that it was just chafing but because I have a baby to protect she prescribed an antiviral. I never had the chickenpox had the vaccine when I was a teenager. She said it is entirely likely I DID have the chickenpox as a kid but was asymptomatic. I took 3 pills for 5 days missed one dose in the middle of the days. The spot got much better pretty quickly. I did develop some sharp pains since I finished the antiviral but nothing unbearable. But today I discovered a new fresh spot in the crease of my opposite armpit. I am wondering 1. If the antiviral did not work And 2. If I am still contagious to my baby.
11588,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: That was a thing for me when I was younger. The prevailing advice at the time was that getting chicken pox young was better than getting it as an adult. If I remember right my older brother caught it first then we invited my cousins over and spread it to them and myself and siblings. As an adult the herpes zoster chicken pox virus came back as trigeminal neuralgia only jaw nerve inflammation causing numbness to the extent that I bit that side of my tongue and cheek.
11590,Admister shingrix on same arm with other vaccines: Yeah i know from experience that many people got shingrix on the same arm with other vaccines but I am just curious if there is any other severe side effects from this beside pain and soreness. Most importantly i really want to know if arexvy and shingrix can be given on the same arm given that both contains the same adjuvant
11591,Shingles vaccine: Did not have any kind of reaction at all.
11593,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I Am an oddball probably. Born in 84 got the vaccine when it came out. Got chicken pox anyhow a few years later probably 98 or so. So both.
11594,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I learned that today when I cranked my AC on high in my car It was not fun to experience. Thank you for the support
11596,Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: I wanna scream!
11599,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: She got vaccinated but still got itso it did not work?
11600,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chickenpox as a kid I think from school. Then later my sister got mumps and mom kept me home from school to hang out with my sister si I could get that out of the way too. Did my school work from home. Never got mumps Shingles runs in my family so my doc got me the shingles shot before I was 50 and then when the new shingles shot came out I got that one too. Now 67 and that is probably one thing I do not want to get....shingles does not care
11602,GenX Shingrix: This a Your Mileage May Vary situation as many of us experience nothing more than a tender arm for a day with both shots. As many times as this has come up I have to keep mentioning that to encourage people to get the shot as the consequences to that are far less sinister than contracting shingles.
11609,Shingles vaccine first dose side effects report: Yeah I definitely do NOT want to get shingles. POTS vestibular migraine and hEDS are bad enough on their own.
11611,Shingles at 35: Wow Well I Am getting a CT scan tomorrow. Guess well see. I still do not see much rash like others just like a red blemish smaller than a dime behind my ear and some dead skin in my hair. Redness in the scalp I Am sure. but at this point I Am pretty positive its shingles and not a malignant mass for the first few days I was convinced the deep cervical massage had done the damage. I have heard other people say they think theirs was triggered by some aggressive physical activity or manual therapy. But I just cannot believe that to be a sole reason. I truly think my unknown strep throat and over stressed behavior just opened the door to it. Just unfortunate no medical practitioner knew what they were doing or believe me enough to put it all together.
11612,Second Shingles Shot: I'd ask your doc if it's necessary. I've always been told having the actual disease is better for the immune system than a vaccine. I just turned 48. I need to ask my doc when I need to get my shingles vax. The disease sounds fucking horrendous from the stories my friends who've had it have told me.
11613,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had shingles in my eye I thought I was literally dying Mine lasted three months
11614,Shingles vaccine: My sister had it on her face and eye too. It was a long painful nightmare. I paid for the shots out of pocket too. I agree. Totally worth it
11618,I Have had one and waiting on the second. Shingles is bad news.
11624,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: I am not an idiot vaccine by any means. That said I have led a fairly lucky healthy life have not needed or seen a doctor since the 80s. Until at 64 I contracted shingles in November. Until today still on pain meds and in serious discomfort. Other than childhood jabs and whatever cocktail the RAF gave me had also been jab free no flu jabs since the 80s until covid jabs. Imagine my reaction to being told that one of the possible side effects they have discovered for the Covid vaccine was reactivation of herpes zoster. This is recent so I have not verified it yet. My wife's having a field day with the theory because she is asking if it is a coincidence that many of her contacts back in Thailand are complaining of itchy rashes and a couple of shingles cases. My uncle 73 who lives with me also recently received an invitation for a shingles jab. Coincidence that they are now actively promoting it? Personally I am torn between getting it and not. The trust has been broken. Edit Forgot to mention do your own due diligence and seek professional medical advice
11626,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Crotch shingles I Am so stealing this. I think mine is fully just the L2 nerve so not technically the crotch but the pain is radiating into the lady parts and its in the areas with pubic hair. Can attest week 3 was way better than week 2 I had glimmers of hope for 5 min here and there where I felt like myself and could laugh again Will see what week 4 brings. I hope by week 5 to exercise again. I do not know how realistic that is.
11627,Oh I feel your pain. I got flattened by both shingles vaccine But my friend has a horrifying story about shingles in his mouth that made me so glad to go through it. I Am glad you are done with the series and hope you feel better soon
11628,I got my flu and covid shot Thurs and my second shingles shot Friday Two sore arms for me right now lol.
11630,Acute Retinal Necrosis from Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus following BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination
11631,My Mom suffered so much from shingles. I got my vaccine and made hubby get his. Hard vaccine to get flu like symptoms but way better than 6 weeks of shingles.
11636,I have never had a reaction to a vaccine but the shingles one is worrying me a bit.
11637,I recovered from the 1st one after 2 days. For the 2nd one I got it on a Friday morning took that day off work did nothing that day Sat or Sunday. It is like having the flu but you can plan for it. My Grandma had shingles multiple times I would take the vaccine any day
11638,Shingles vaccine experience: Yes. A bit of a sore arm for a day or two from both shot shots. If you re hesitant just ask someone that has had a bad case of shingles to tell you their story. That s what motivated me to finally get the vaccine. A sore arm for a few days is nothing compared to the agony my friend went through with shingles.
11640,RSV Vaccine: We welcomed our little one in October and she received the RSV vaccine at the hospital just three days after birth. She had absolutely no side effects and I could not be more grateful it was offered. Id read some heartbreaking stories about babies getting really sick so having this extra layer of protection gave me so much peace of mind. She Is a healthy happy little baby There Is information about the vaccination here
11642,Shingles vaccine experience: Everyone GET THE SHOTS. I was 49. Noticed a headache then some scaling behind my ear. Went straight to a clinic got diagnosed and was given an antiviral shot immediately. A mild case of shingles developed over the next few days from the crown of my head behind my ear and down my neck but all in all not too bad and cleared up in a few days. Three weeks later i woke up completely deaf in the ear. Turns out the Zoster virus likes to get in your auditory hearing or ocular eyesight nerves and it basically shorts them out. 12 years later it is awful  way worse than tinnitus just constant coherent noise 247 and I cannot hear well in any noisy environment even though my other ear is pretty good. Sometimes it is loud enough that I have trouble sleeping. Pain aside you can end up blind or deaf. Tell everyone you know. GET THE SHOTS.
11643,Shingles vaccine experience: I went through singles and had red welts from my forehead down to my ribs. It hurt like hell. I would take ten shingles vaccines if that was what we had to do to avoid getting it

11645,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: It was awful with the whole have to sleep sitting up thing the constant razor nerve pain and the permanent after effects of very mild reoccurring chronic nerve pain. It feels like a very slight painful tingle that comes and goes. My torso scarring is very light because I did everything I could to avoid bursting the blisters which I mostly succeeded. But I consider myself lucky compared to those that got it on the side of their face. My neighbor got it inside her ear and her wifes mother had it wrap around her face into her eye years ago before she died. She nearly went blind. Get your shots people.
11646,henlo rZeroCovidCommunity I have seen y'alls posts circulating on Twitter from screenshots and people talking about it and despite not using reddit as much anymore I pulled up and have been using an older account of mine that used to be a throwaway. I am 32 years old. I have had covid 4x. Once either late Dec 2019 or early Jan 2020 I do not know I was in and out of the doctor's office for months around that time. Respiratory infection coughing for 2 weeks after being violently ill for 23 days and throwing up black bile. I worked retail at that time and could not take off more than 3 days a month without being fired so I had to work through the rest of the 2 weeks I was sick. Then I got BV for the first time ever it gave me breathing problems and worsened my asthma. My second infection was in 2020 as well I tested positive on Halloween 2020 because I was working retail and my manager who was not masking and was meeting up with randos from dating sites to fool around worked sick for a week and refused to mask when the store was not open to customers. I never recovered from this one my store was shut down for a month and my managers never apologized for nearly killing me and ultimately killing me down the line. My knee started hurting sometime at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 again I do not remember I was so scared about getting covid again and getting over it and this was before I knew how it affected my body and it is also worked it is way up into the hip. The doctors have not found anything wrong with me yet but I use a cane and have been since I was 28 years old. I had it two more times vaccine but whatever at that point the damage has been done. Yes I was masking but I was wearing cloth masks with LOW ventilation in my workplace not even a functioning AC during summer 2020 and then switched to surgicals and removed them to drinkeat and the air purifier we had was not enough for the whole store. ANYWAYS onto the main point of my ventcomplaint here. I have shingles. I have had shingles now for about 8 weeks sometime between 7 and 8 weeks my roommate was out of town when I got it and the symptoms started for days before I developed a rash seems to largely be internal shingles so it is hell getting doctors to even look at me and starting on Saturday I developed myoclonus which is similar to those sleep jerks you get when you are laying in bed and you try to sleep and your heart rate drops and then you jerk awake. But it happens when I am awake and it is really annoying. I am waiting on my blood tests and my UTI test in two hours and I just wanted to tell people like it is not just covid. It is not just MECFS. It might be months before I can get into a neurologist appointment and no one wants to give me any help because they think I am drug seeking for 100mg gabapentin when I am having such severe myoclonus that I cannot hold my phone and the shingles pain is radiating all the way up my right side same as my bad knee and hip and it is hell. please mask up and please tell your loved ones to mask up EDIT 1 people think I was not masking after my second infection and it is not true I just did not learn about safer masks and the right fit until 2022 thanks to my local maskbloc so.... at that point I would had 4 infections 3 was when my Mom died from myocarditis caused by covid during the biggest spike in 2021 12312021 and then when my roommate decided not to wear a mask when he went to a family member's graduation and brung it back to me for the 4th time. Those are both after I quit my retail job because I could not work there anymore and were absolutely outside of my control.
11649,Shingles shot: Do it. My late father lost most vision in one eye due to shingles
11650,"Entyvio vs Rinvoq: Hey! I've failed Simponi recently after almost a decade in remission from moderate/severe distal UC. I've been asked to research both Entyvio and Rinvoq as next steps. Anywhere tried them? Which did you prefer? Downsides/side effects? I worry about some of the side effects with Rinvoq, I'm very active and have two young kids, I've heard a lot about acne, shingles, how immunosuppressive it can be compared to some other meds. Entyvio sounds nicer, less side effects and not having to remember it every day sounds easy. But I also hear it doesn't have the same track record or effective remission as the Rinvoq. Anyways, just looking for experiences here with either or both. :)"
11651,Houston pediatricians that offer RSV vaccine: Texas childrens pediatrics. My son got his when he was born but they only have a few every week at least they did last year so you will need to call and find out if they have any available. When the pediatrician called me to say they had gotten 5 for that week he said I needed to go in that day because they could not reserve the vaccines
11653,ca Protecting infants against RSV infection: I wish I has been informed about the availability of an rsv vaccine in pregnancy. Here I am holding my 9 day old at the children's hospital wondering if that is what he has ans why he is having trouble breathing. Did everything we could to protect him. His big sister and myself and husband are fully vaccinated minus RSV only had one visitor so far my mom who is staying with us for 10 days to help with post partem and yet he still might have contracted something nasty. Fuck people who do not get vaccinated by choice
11656,I think my immunity is compromised Herpes Zoster frequently sick: I get that too. This fall I got a few little viruses my kids brought home then sinus infection then shingles now in a long flare. Looking back every time I have a significant flare it comes after a sinus infection. The last time I got COVID I was actually fine after a week. A few steps I am taking I had my streptococcal sp antibodies tested and they were low. The doc thought this could be the because of so many sinus infections. Next week I am getting the pneumonia vaccine which is usually only for older folks. In addition to potentially reducing infections they will retest me to make sure I actually develop the right antibodies Working with ENT to potentially treat blocked sinuses physically. I already had a balloon sinuplasty which did not help for me
11657,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: You could be right but there are various reports of young adults getting shingles following the covid vaccine. Sometimes even a few days after the shot. My dad did but he is older. A vaccine affects your immune system in various ways so logically a dormant virus could take advantage of the situation. Messing with your natural immune system has side effects.
11664,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got chicken pox at around the age of 27 while in LA for my first real audition exposed everyone casting and auditioning for Pot C 2 and did not get the part and Cassandra Peterson whom I had coffee with and later had to call and ask if she had ever had chicken pox. She had not. I have never been so mortified. I had no idea I had chickenpox. Jet lag? What is this random pimple or 5? Stress. I thought it was all stress. Why would I suspect chickenpox at 27? My first trip to LA was memorable for all the wrong reasons. Never felt so horrible in my life. I will never skip a vaccine for shingles. Getting chickenpox was horrible enough as an adult. I have heard horror stories about how bad shingles can be. I have only had mild symptoms from the vaccine but I am sure even more severe symptoms would be preferable to getting shingles.
11666,I may have had my shingles vaccine too early after treatment.: no transplant I checked with my doctor if the vaccine timing was ok cold and flu vaccines are ok but the covid vaccine always knocks me out for 24 hours
11667,Got them on my face: Shingles are so miserable. I Am so sorry. I got Shingles the 3rd week of March and I Am still not 100 percent. If you progress into severe itching like I did my doctor prescribed a hydroxyzine pill. It does make you sleepy but it helped my itching a lot. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to text me. Prayers for you.
11668,: My husband and I were shamed into taking it 2021...because my husband had diabetes.....3 months later my husband had massive heart attack....year later we both got covid.....he almost died and has kidney damage ....we have been weak ever since and I have the brain fog....we are in 70s
11673,Aciclovir  Electroceuticals  chasing the viral persistencereactivation theory  more: My wife has had a very similar journey to you. The watering eye and blisters in the mouth sound like shingles. Please take any eye symptoms seriously and act fast it is possible for permanent damage to take hold quickly. My wife is on long term aciclovir and using a medfit TENs machine with ear clip for vagus nerve stimulation. It seems to help but it is far from a cure. She uses Symprove to improve gut symptoms. Dispersible aspirin helps with pain symptoms.
11680,I had no problems with the first or the second shingles vaccine just a mild sore arm nothing like the flu shot which aches for days but my understanding is that people generally only have a rough reaction to one or the other so do not be afraid of the second one
11681,"""COVID vaccine and Fatigue: I feel it's important to share my story to raise awareness, not to deter anyone from getting vaccinated. Following my second dose, I have been experiencing extreme fatigue, which is unusual for me. It's crucial to remember that this is my individual experience and might not be linked to the vaccine. Has anyone else encountered similar symptoms post COVID vaccination?"""
11689,Shingles vaccine: Aches a bit of fever for 24 hours. NOTHING at all like having shingles. Believe me you DO NOT want to get shingles.
11691,"2nd Dose Moderna: Received my (54F) 2nd dose of Moderna Wednesday, March 24th at 1:20PM. Woke up in the wee hours of Thursday morning with joint/muscle aches - very similar to the reaction I had to the second Shingrix jab. Easily addressed with ibuprofen. Feeling just fine today. My daughter is a teacher and she had her second Pfizer dose on Wednesday as well. The last time we shared a meal in person was March 13, 2020. Excited to have lunch with her in 2 weeks!"
11692,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles on my face last year at 40yo. In my life I have had 5 attacks of ideopathic acute severe pancreatitis with cooccuring gallstones and ovairian cysts had my uterus twist a full 360 degrees while pregnant and go untreated for 14 hours and I live with two severe debilitating connective tissue disorders. I have given birth twice with NO meds or epidural and no follow up meds and... Shingles was possibly one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. That shit is no joke. I was bedridden for 3 months. Absolutely excruciating nerve pain. I could not even open my mouth to eat for a week. I had to drop 10k on an Ayurvedic healing center just to be able to walk and move again I was so decimated after three months in agony and slow recovery. Could not work could not even take care of my kids except from my chair in my bedroom. Spent thousands in emergency childcare extra meal support etc. Seven visits to urgent care. I have a dime sized permanent scar on my face from a blister got a systemic staph infection from the blisters getting infected then had a reaction to the broad spectrum antibiotics and have permanent rosacea like a raccoon mask on my face too. It will cost like 8k in cold laser therapy to have the rosacea treated which is not covered by insurance and is not a permanent solution. I do not even tend to get extra vaccines like flu etc but I am definitely getting that vaccine as soon as I am able. Pay for that vaccine and get it now because if you get it let me tell you are going to pay so much more.
11695,Shingles Sucks: I had it on my foreheadeyebrow area last December after just turning 45. My eye was swollen shit for a couple days and the pain was brutal. I would not have made it through without gabapentin for sure. Blue Emu lidocaine helped as well after the scabbing died down. That shit was horrible. It is been a year now and I still get brief little tingly reminders of it a few times a day every day.
11696,Shingles shot: I Am with you there. The pharmacist said people react to one or the other and i am hoping that my bad reaction is out of the way with the joint pain.
11697,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: My arm was sore especially with the second dose but I know two people who have had shingles and they said it was hell so... do what you got to do.
11705,SK any Sask moms get the RSV vaccine during their pregnancies?: I am in AB but I got it. I did not have coverage through our insurance so we just paid for it. I did not have any reactions at all not even a sore arm My OB wrote me a prescription for it. The first pharmacy refused because they said it had to be 6 weeks since my last vaccine pertussis but the OB said that was incorrect and gave me another and it was fine. I recommend calling around and booking an appointment. A couple pharmacies I called said they were not taking private appointments. I figure if there is anything I can do to keep this little bean safe Ill do it.
11706,Shingles vaccine: Neither shot was that bad. Little fatigued and lazy for a day. That was about it. Now if you need any motivation I have a friend that got full blown shingles and it was miserable. Went on for weeks. Very painful. Blistery rash. If they could go back and take the vaccine they would do it without hesitation.
11708,Shingles vaccine: second dose: Second one was worse for me. I got the vaccine after my friend's father got shingles in his EYE.
11709,ON got my RSV vaccine: I also had no reaction to mine Not even arm pain.
11710,Urgent care has no idea thinks its shingles.: I developed chronic shingles so I have had it 7 times since 2021 5 times in the same location then once on my thigh and once on my calf. I Am currently on a daily antiviral long term. But I also have multiple autoimmune disorders and they think the shingles was a reaction to the Covid vaccine. Now I Am not allowed ANY vaccines until further notice
11711,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I have not because it is not free for me yet and it cost around 600. My husband is older than me and he had his first dose. The doctor said to me not to stress too much if you come down with shingles and get onto it early enough you can get the anti virus vaccine which makes a huge difference apparently.
11712,Shingles vaccine experience: I used to work in a nursing home and one of the residents in her late 90s had frequent shingles episodes that were absolutely excruciating for her. There did not seem to be any type of pain control that took away what she was experiencing and this was someone who toughed out the Depression in rural Alabama between two world wars. You did the right thing.
11713,We had friends over to our house for dinner. The next day my friend told me she started experiencing burning pain on her skin and the day after that lesions developed and she was diagnosed with shingles. So we were around her one day prior to symptoms and two days prior to lesions appeared. My child is not old enough to be vaccinated for chickenpox yet. Could my child develop chickenpox from this exposure?
11716,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I may have been lucky but I had no issues with either shot. Good luck
11717,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah. That is how I got hand mouth mumps measles rubella. I did get vaccine for diphtheria tetanus polio AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I thought the parties were normal att.
11721,100 Although I am vaccinated because after surviving Cancer I need all the immunity help I can get. I just had my Second Shingles shot 3 days ago. Man Was I ever sick But I do not believe in the flu vaccination and will not get one just because I Am told to.
11722,hi folks...anyone get shingrix?: I got it last year. I ve had shingles a few times since then but I always catch it with the first 72 hours so I never get more than a small red patch on my lower back. Honestly don t think it did me any good at all.
11723,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: So sorry For now I have had little nerve pain.I Am surprised that my doctor did not mention recently shingles vaccine when I got all my other vaccines.
11724,"Just got the flu shot and wow, the side effects are hitting me hard! I got the flu shot yesterday and today I woke up feeling like a truck ran over me. My whole body aches, I have a headache, and I feel feverish. I didn't expect this strong of a reaction from a simple vaccine. Has anyone else experienced this after getting the flu shot? ---"
11725,Shingles vaccine: I cannot get the shingles vaccine in my country for free until I Am 65. I am 51 and guess what I started getting shingles on Christmas Day and ended up with a massive shingles rash across my boob and up across my back. I was very sick for three days with high temperature. Two weeks later I still have scabs and some pox but rash is reduced but the stabbing pains kicked in a week ago. Where I struggled to sleep at night. I am taking pain medication and was on antivirals. I do not know how long this pain is going to last. I Am hoping not months as it may affect my job. My elderly neighbour has had shingles for three years straight and its affected her face and eyesight. Her quality of life has been greatly reduced. My advice get the vaccine It just is not worth the pain and agony.
11726,Shingles shot?: My doc told me to get it. I read all about it and said no. He initially told me I would not qualify for my med Rinvoq without the vaccine but I went around him and talked to the pharmacy center and got approved anyway. I did not want to get the vaccine. Same story as yours never had chickenpox got the vaccine as a kid. Anyway I failed Rinvoq in the first three days due to horrible Crohns reaction to it. Totally flared up like crazy. So the vaccine would have been all for nothing anyway.
11728,I got a debuff I thought only affected higher level players: I was unfortunately hit with this debuff at 21. While I did make a 99 recovery I do have the loss of sensation debuff in my right armpit. Funny enough I had received the vaccine item the level before and my healer believed that it made furthermore debilitating postshingles debuffs less likely not necessarily that it prevented the primary shingles debuff.
11729,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I got it in my 30s and it SUCKED. No scarring and very minor rash but a 10 day fever that rocked me. I got chicken pox when I was 17 so fairly late in life really surprised me to get shingles. Yes I got my vaccines as soon as they came out.
11730,Shingles vaccine experience: I felt a little out of sorts for a day. Beats the hell out of shingles.
11731,More evidence of a failing immune system: I can attest to friends family and neighbours getting it. All vaccinated. Herpes too which was really strange this was more around the time after the second shot shingles was after the third if I remember right. Whatever it is it is definitely related to the shot.
11734,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I had shingles before I had fibromyalgia. I have since had the vaccine and had no issues. Even if I had a bad day from the vaccine it beats getting shingles again. Very painful.
11735,I got my shot for shingles today: I drank the shot and woke up six hours later in a strange place. Maybe roofies are not what I thought they were.
11736,Shingles vaccine experience: Lemon balm cream is very helpful with the rash. I had shingles on my bum. Very unpleasant
11737,Shingles on my face and scalp: Thank you for the support. I did see an ophthalmologist and I have a follow up booked for next week. She prescribed me a steroid drop to help with the inflammation in addition to the antivirals. My head was really debilitating to the point where I thought I was going to have to go to the ER. It was not a typical headache or anything I had ever endured before. I also am experiencing the electrical shocks. They Are pretty brief and tolerable but not enjoyable at all.
11740,I Am 20w4d. Met with my OB today Went over labs they took earlier in my pregnancy. Somehow even though I am fully vaccinated which I know for 100 fact as I got my records from my pediatrician about two years ago for work.I am no longer immune to measles mumps rubella or chicken poxshingles. I cannot be vaccinated again until after pregnancy. Me okaywellIm an infanttoddler teacher lol OB you are a WHAT??? So now I need to be incredibly careful for the rest of my pregnancy and will probably need to wear a mask at work. I have never in 6 years of working with kids come into contact with any of these illnesses. I work at a private center that requires vaccines and as far as I know does not allow for any exemptions. But with how some people are with vaccines God knows Only a little bit terrified
11746,Shingles: No. I got the first Shingrix shot before starting methotrexate. I also got the flu pneumonia DTAP and Covid booster all before starting MTX. I got the second dose after I already started the meds. After MTX caused liver issues and Otezla was a failure I am now on Enbrel and sulfasalazine. FYI I know several people one of whom is rather young in his late 30s who have gotten shingles also including my mother in law. They all were quite miserable. One person I know got it on their face. So after seeing all that I knew it was best to do what the doc said and get the Shingrix shots.
11747,Got diagnosed for shingles today :( I'm only 19: I get it over my left eye
11748,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Just adding on to what everyone else has said. Shingles was the most debilitating illness my husband has ever had. Not sure what your doctor is thinking but it absolutely causes extreme fatigue.
11750,Booty hole Shingles: I was diagnosed Nov 29th 2023 still suffer from numb burning pain I Have been trying to cut my doses of lyrica right now I Am taking 75mg50mg50mg. Pain is worse at lower dose obviously but I Am finding myself not feeling all there when I was on higher doses was taking 100mg three times a day and was having brain fog and higher anxiety and short fused. I Am at the point where I Am accepting this is not going to go away as my situation has not really improved
11754,"Adverse reaction to Shingles Vax: 50 yo overweight, white female on a long list of psych meds for years I got the Shingles (Shingrix) vaccine last Tuesday Dec 7 @ 8 am. The nurse told me to expect pain and redness. I was not expecting what has happened. For the first three days it hurt as bad as if the needle was still in my arm, and I am not a needle-phobic person. I also had a low-grade fever (99-100 degrees) for the first two days and body aches and pains. There was a red splotch mark on my arm where the nurse gave me the injection, about the size of a coffee cup. The redness turned into a black and blue bruise and I thought it was finally healing up. The pain started to fade by Saturday, though was still sore to the touch. Today the redness is back in the form of a circle with a bruise in the middle. And a yellow ""shingle"" like sore in the very middle of the bruise. The whole area feels raised too. I've not taken any aspirin throughout this ordeal, but some Tylenol. I've looked on the Shingrix website and can't find anything about an adverse reaction quite like this. I am going to call my doctor in the morning, but would appreciate any input! Thank you! <url> Picture isn't the best and doesn't show the true colors for whatever reason."
11755,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had chickenpox as a kid and then I got shingles at 35 when I was pregnant with my first. It was excruciating It had it covering my baby bump. I was so sore and itchy. Luckily the antivirals they give are considered safe for pregnancy so I was able to take them. I also lucked out being pregnant because as soon as I saw the rash pop up on my belly I called my doctor I might have waited a few days if I was not pregnant but when pregnant you do not want to take any risks and was diagnosed and started the antivirals that day. Ill be getting the shingles vaccine as soon as I Am eligible as I certainly do not want to go through it again.
11759,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: I got diagnosed with Shingles on July 16th and I have just started running again this week of August 12th. I too felt like I had broken ribs along with lethargy fatigue loss of appetite and feeling generally sorry for myself. After the course of medication my rash had more or less subsided in about 710 days but the 'broken ribs' kept on trucking for a while after that. As I am finding my feet again after almost 4 weeks of not running I started with a few 5k easy runs then an 8k and yesterday managed a 13k. The first few runs were the hardest but yesterday i almost felt like I remembered how to do it I also had to pull out of Skyline 50k which I was devastated about. Happy to answer any questions you might have as my experience was so recent. Best of luck on the recovery and try to be patient with your body you will get back out there soon enough. And yes residual effects have been known to last up to 6 weeks. I still find some discomfort in my ribs but it is not made any worse by running and I am actually not sure if it is phantom pain or not. Nerve issues are hard to pinpoint.
11761,Shingles vaccine experience: I got my vaccine 4 months after getting shingles. The shot was almost nothing. But shingles was as painful as 36 hours of unmedicated labor I tell everyone to get the vaccine. Dr told me to get it even though I would had shingles because it would make a potential next outbreak much less painful and bad.
11762,I got shingles in m3: also as a plug against mid levels i was told it was a muscle strain by an NP and that the rash was a atopic dermatitis granted i only had a small cluster of vesicles at the time and my main symptoms was neuropathic pain and only got diagnosed after 2 days of excruciating pain down my arm and a whole bunch of vesicles popping up
11763,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Honestly, if you're thinking about going on a diet, a colonoscopy is a great way to jumpstart one!"
11767,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am immune compromised but I was able to get the vaccine at age 43. I just walked into my local grocery store with a pharmacy and asked to get it. They did not need any proof or documentation either. Check around and see where you can get it.
11768,No kidding. My minor child got the varicella vaccine specifically so he has a better chance of avoiding Shingles.
11769,According to a report from Japan a 60yearold immunocompromised Japanese man developed shingles after receiving the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine with symptoms including fever fatigue and headache
11770,We had the Shingrix course recently. Neither of us had any side effects except the usual sore arm for a couple of days.
11773,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: I was 28 when I got Gardasil 9 back in 2018. The side effects were no different than the flu vaccine or any other vaccine I have had sore arm but that was it. No regrets about getting it.
11774,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: It was not bad just surprising because it had never happened to me before. Shots give me a painful arm but I do not recall the shingles shot doing so nor did I feel wiped out. But getting shingles terrifies me and reading some of the comments on here about folks that have had it makes me really glad I got the shot and will be following up with the second in Feb
11777,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Thanks for the reminder that I need to book this vaccine I actually did have a mild case of the shingles when I was in my 30 s. It was only after my husband who would never had the chicken pox or been vaccinated against it came down with the chicken pox that I realized I had shingles. I would been telling him to get the vaccine for years.
11783,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yep. And that is why I am so grateful there is a vaccine. Ill get it as soon as I can.
11787,Will the pain ever stop? I started having a small rash a 5 days ago doctor said it looked like bug bites. I went back this morning he said it looks like shingles and starts me on valacyclovir. I have it on my face its on my eyelid and my cheek. I cannot even blink without being in pain. I have a high pain tolerance but the pain is 1110. I do not know if this pain is normal or if something is seriously wrong. Should I go to the ER? I keep getting woken up every hour from the burning eye pain. There Is a white spot on my eyelid that looks infected. Even cold water feels like there is a knife in my eye. I Am terrified that it should not be feeling this painful after taking the first dose of medicine. I Am 24 years old and I Have never had a health scare like this before. My partner is away on vacation so I Am also home alone right now. I do not know what to do Update thank you to everyone who gave advice and validated me about the pain. I went back to my doctor and got prescribed Lyrica. I am hoping that lessens the pain along with eye drops. I wish everyone else going through this a speedy recovery
11788,Should I get the HPV vaccine?: Can you name one singular con to the vaccine aside from having a sore arm for a few days? Versus the benefit of not contracting and spreading HPV OR greatly reducing the risk of getting cancer if you do contract HPV.
11789,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I got shingles in 2020. Then got a flare a year later. I Am scared the vaccine will flare it lol going to talk to my dr about it this year. I got it on my face and the way you cokld tell it from regular oral herpes is that the pain is out of this world awful and I say this as a person who already has regular nerve pain issues. It was like someone set my face on fire and no one could put it out. Like screaming bad. And that was just when my too low a dose anti virals wore down.
11790,Shingles again?: TY Yes they are a pain in the patootie literally the 4th and 5th times lol
11791,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Have not yet anyone deal with bad side effects? Just thinking ahead to whether I need to schedule it before a weekend. Covid vaccines all made me extremely sick. I know it is different but my immune system goes crazy.
11793,Shingles Is NO Joke: I had it in my inner ear a few years ago it was horrific Severe pain vertigo facial paralysis the whole shebang Make sure you rest up take care of yourself feel better soon
11795,Currently 36w and a week into being sick with Covid and I am still struggling. But my congestion might be getting better? Coughing hurts less that is for sure. But I started getting a mild headache last night and it is come and gone today. I was thinking it was just sinus pressure but when I took my BP it said 11085. But if later came down to 9579. I know wrist BP cuffs are not the most accurate but I am so worried it is the start of preeclampsia. Esp since Covid and the RSV vaccine had that 2 weeks ago are known to increase your risk of developing it. Any one have similar bo when such? Was it ok? What do you do if you develop PE?
11797,Must admit I Have struggled with some of your posts first bout is shingles for me was 30 years ago I was pregnant not able to take antivirals. Paracetamol was my only option for pain relief. 2nd time 2021 after Covid vaccination 3rd 4th 5 th time since then 12
11798,Hi all I just got diagnosed with shingles for the first time having a blast its showing up on both sides of my back which have doctors perplexed. Thankfully I caught it early and I Am already on 1g of valtrex 3xday for 10 days but since they are small lesions I Am trying to keep them covered with bandages to a avoid spreading anything to my boyfriend and b avoid the pain that comes with my clothes touching the rash. As you can see from the photos my skin is getting very irritated using regular latex free bandaids so wanted to see if anyone has any advice on how to keep them covered comfortably Also open to stories of having this on both sides of your back getting this with no symptomatic chicken pox history getting diagnosed in your 20s topical treatment recommendations etc as I get through this. Thank you
11799,Rsv: I was not able to get mine while pregnant some sort of guideline about being between 3236 weeks pregnant between SepJan and unfortunately I had my baby 96. She got hers along with her normal 2m shots and was fine She ran a fever 23 times so gave her tylenol and lots of naps but otherwise normal. I would 100 do it again Beyfortis is the one my baby got technically not super new but newly approved by FDA. Clinical trials have been ongoing since 2016. This one is good for 8m I was told. The Abryvso one during pregnancy is seemingly good for 6m. This one is a vaccine rather than the Beyfortis being an antibody.
11800,"55 yr old female diagnosed this morning: Hi everyone, I wanted to share my recent health journey with shingles. I'm a 55 year old woman who was diagnosed this morning after experiencing intense itching and burning on my abdomen. I had received the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine a few days before the symptoms appeared. The rash quickly spread, and I felt extremely fatigued and run down. The doctor confirmed it was shingles and started me on antiviral treatment. She mentioned that the vaccine could have potentially triggered the shingles due to its impact on the immune system. I wanted to share my story to create awareness and to connect with others who may have gone through a similar experience. Let's support each other during this challenging time."
11802,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Potentially. It is not a given. I had the vaccine as a child back in the 80s and did my titers 2 years ago for a bunch of antibodies and all of the childhood stuff was still strong.
11804,Notalgia Parasthetica: That shingles vaccine is a DOOZY. But I am glad I got it
11806,Shingles and other Vaccines: I Am disabled permanently from the COVID Vaccine. I will not take any vaccine now. I Am scared to death. Especially Shingles. No way You are not being a baby. Why take the chance?
11811,I almost called 911 after a shingles vaccine it was actually the 2nd no problems with the first. Not saying one should not get them just be prepared for a lost daynight.
11812,Okay this is my 3rd time having shingles? Like why? Anyone else? I have never had them extremely badly but I get them on my sciatic nerve root every time and I am over it this is 3? Just wondering if I am alone ...?
11816,Rapamycin: I am guessing there is a reason we are told to titrate. My pharmacist also strongly suggested I take the Shingles vaccine beforehand as a preventative measure. The doses we are dealing with may be low but they are not insignificant. I would pull back a bit if I were you. Especially if unpleasant sideeffects are popping up. I started at 2mg eleven days ago then took 4mg four days ago. No bad sideeffects. Felt more energy I think? but had to attend a funeral so am dealing with the after effects of that. TLDR not cured yet. Will post updates.
11817,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Here in Ireland there are people with the cure. I Got the shingles last year and was in severe pain all down my chest right arm. My Father tells me there is a guy about 10 kms away and he has the cure. Now I do not believe in all that mumbo jumbo but I said Fuck it what is the harm Called him up went out and he rubbed some stuff on my sore bits. He said go to town give something for the lost souls go to the church and light a candle for them and donate something. No word of a lie when I woke the next day I had no pain and all the sores went from bright redpink to dark brown. Totally gone the day after that. Mad Stuff.
11818,I am in Ohio. I have prescription drug coverage through my employer with CVS Caremark. Medical insurance through Medical Mutual. My husband and I were advised by our doctors to get the shingles vaccine. We are both in our 50s. He was also advised to get the Hepatitis B vaccine as he is on the kidney transplant list. We tried to schedule them at CVS but CVS canceled our appointments saying our insurance will not cover the vaccines. My husband's doctor said he can get them at the doctor's office but that we would have to pay out of pocket for it. We have never had any problems getting other vaccines covered. I thought the ACA requires vaccines to be covered? Does that only apply to certain vaccines?
11821,Second Shingles Shot: Check with your pharmacist. Since you are 49 have already had shingles they may give it to you. Remember that it is 2 shots a few months apart. I Have had shingles for over 25 years. I recently had another outbreak of shingles 1st one in well over a year or two and the patch was smaller did not hurt near as much and was drying up within the same week. I received my shots 6 yrs ago. It absolutely works
11824,If I take my second dose of five tomorrow will I likely feel even slightly better than I did last week with my first five? I am only asking for anecdotal evidence unless anyone has true sources by chance.
11825,Shingrix for pharmacists?: My eye is doing much better. The val t rex is great the gaba pent in was BS. The per co cet was much better even though I understand gaba pent in is specifically for nerve pain it did eff all. I had a lot of trouble going from light to dark and vice versa but wearing sunglasses helped. The biggest concern is that it will happen again in the same area and so I am going to make an appointment with immunology and see if we can get the shingles shot after this. Thank you so much for the well wishes
11826,Hello again. perseveringface Flu like symptoms started Wednesday irritating spot on my butt and thigh Thursday. Noticed a few spots with burning on Friday in a straight line and immediately thought shingles but put in the back of my head. Bothered me all day could not sit or lay on that side. Got in yesterday and started antivirals. The flu like symptoms fatigue have been terrible or maybe more noticeable this time now that I am more aware. Docs as always tell me I cannot get the vaccine. Just to keep stress low. I do my best. I asked the pharmacist yesterday about the vaccine and she said 18 and older can get it now? She ran my insurance and of course I need a pre authorization but she said based on my history she cannot see insurance denying it. I will not hold my breath. Has anyone had any luck with this yet under the age of 50? I am desperate to not deal with this any more. She also asked how many times I had chicken pox as a child as she is seenheard of some children having it more than once because they were unable to build immunity. I thought that was interesting.
11836,22 A few years later I had the vaccine I did not have a particularly bad reaction. Sore arm tired for a day. Same for the 2nd. Both were way better than the shingles my case was mild. I know people who had nerve damage and pain for years. Get the vaccine
11846,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Ick! I did mine two weeks ago. Totally blew the weekend."
11850,"What Are My Chances of Getting into Medical School with Little-to-No Vaccination History: I made an account just to ask this question, as I'm a bit concerned about one feature of my medical records that will probably impact my ability to get into medical school. That being that I only have the Meningococcal and Tdap vaccines, and my last Tdap vaccine was in 2011. I have such a short vaccine history due to my struggles with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which was triggered by the first dose of the MMR vaccine alongside a febrile seizure when I was three. Strangely enough, the first dose of the MMR vaccine isn't listed on my records, but Meningococcal and Tdap are (I believe I received these as boosters in middle or elementary school?). I had no reaction to the Meningococcal and Tdap vaccines. However, due to my previous struggles and the fact that I remain constantly fatigued (a symptom of GBS), I'm trying to avoid any further vaccination to keep another flare-up from happening. GBS is currently listed as a contraindication on my state vaccine record. Although my second to last episode was two years ago and I tend to only have a flare-up once a year at most, it started acting up today due to the fact I have the Flu. I'd like to clarify that I'm not an anti-vaxxer by any sense of the word and I'd resent being called that. It's just that depending on the school, I'd have to take the Polio vaccine, another Tdap vaccine as I'm due for another, two doses of the MMR because the first was never registered, the Flu Vaccine yearly, the Varicella vaccine, the Hep B vaccine, the Hep A vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine, and the HPV vaccine. All of these vaccines have GBS as a potential side-effect, and I'd have to take them one after the other. I believe this would compound the risk of aggravation. Anyways, what I wanted to ask was if assuming I get no further vaccines, what are my chances of getting an exemption and still getting into medical school? I can potentially risk taking one or two vaccines if necessary, but I want to minimize said risk. I still want to be a doctor despite my condition holding me back. TL;DR I have GBS and as a result have basically no-"
11851,Could reactivation of herpes virus because neuropathy and brainfog? Shingles vaccine?: I took Artemisinin for a few days my brain fog cleared up. The die off effect was so bad I had to stop Artemisinin kills covid and herpes viruses in test tube. Makes you wonder
11853,"Second Shingrix shot, checking in.: I got the 2nd shingles shot yesterday at 10:30 am. -4 hours later (around 2pm) the shot site became tender and moving my arm became slightly painful. -At 4pm I began getting a headache. - 9pm the body aches and slight chills kicked in. - 10:30pm I drank nightime theraflu and went to sleep. - 4am I woke up sweating and with a fever and body aches, took some Tylenol. Went back to sleep - 11am woke up again with fever, took a daytime theraflu - its 4:42pm right now and I still have body aches, headache and low grade fever. I am lucky enough to have the next 2 days off. The second shot is no joke."
11857,It is easily the worst side effect to a vaccine I have ever had but it is nowhere near as bad as the shingles flair up I had.
11858,Had the second shingles shot: I had a reaction but yeah it was on the order of let me take some Tylenol and I Am glad I do not have anything planned today. It was not a big deal.
11861,I never had Shingles until I took the Shingles shot. No more vaccines for me ever.
11862,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I think they lowered the recommended age recently. I just got flu pneumonia. And first round of shingles just last week TDAP up next
11865,14 weeks 79 pounds: Thank you I mentioned it because I got shingles either the day of or the day after I went to 1.0 from .5 and it seemed coincidental.
11868,Immunosuppressant biologics and vaccines: Your mistake was in getting two vaccines at once especially when one of them was the Covid vaccine. It may technically be okay to get them both at once but I advise against it. The shingles vaccine is even worse. Get that one when you do not have to work the next day. They say that people respond badly to either the first dose or the second dose but I responded badly to both doses.
11870,Got Bursitis ???? You probably got it from one of the vaccines that were administered to you...I got bursitis from the shingles vaccine that I got about 8 years ago....They call it SIRVA...
11871,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My millennial coworker got chickenpox as an adult because another coworker showed up with shingles. It was hell on the chickenpox coworkercaused eye problems had lesions all over he was out for a while. If you have shingles please be careful.
11873,Shingles vaccine: Never had anything more than injection site aches from any vaccine.
11878,My first Covid shot and my shingles shots were about the same on the misery level.
11883,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mom managed to get it a few years ago and has some sort of chronic response still. If she gets stressed it looks and feels like she has it all over again in the same spots. In the beginning the doctor thought it was tooth related and she had an unnecessary root canal. They finally diagnosed it and gave her meds. Then it flared up again a few weeks later. More meds. A month later. More meds. Eventually she just stopped asking for the meds. It just flares up from time to time. Weird ass disease.
11884,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles twice in my early 30s so my physician suggested getting it. My arm was inflamed and super sore for about two weeks but I Have not gotten shingles again so that is good
11885,For me having shingles felt like what I imagined being stabbed with an ice pick would feel like. On every single sore. And the ice pick is white hot from sitting in a fire for hours first. Add severe exhaustion. The shot is cake even if you feel icky for a day or two. Get it
11887,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You can get vaccines at most chain pharmacies Walmart Target and your local health department. There is no need to wait a year to get into a doctor.
11888,I had the shingles vaccine and the Covid vaccine. I just ran this morning and feel better then ever
11890,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I got mine a couple years ago and had the opposite experience from you in that the second shot was a bit more difficult than the first. Totally worth it of course because it is way better than getting Shingles. My husband is getting his soon has he has switched insurance plans and is now covered. Huge relief to me that he is getting the vaccine vaccines. Our son who is now in his early 20's will not need one because he got the chicken pox vaccine as a baby. I was so happy when they offered that not having known that such a vaccine existed. he is never had to have chicken pox and he will not have to get shingles. Yay vaccines
11895,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Ok? I got the chicken pox vaccine and it gave me a lowgrade version of the chickenpox which later gave me EBV and now Ill probably still get shingles too.
11897,I know vaccines are a controversial topic but I wanted to share my personal experience to provide reassurance to any pregnant mamas questioning if they should get the RSV vaccine or not. I opted to get the vaccine while I was pregnant and I remember worrying if I was doing the right thing since people seemed to be pretty divided on this vaccine. I am now sitting here with my perfect 5 day old son and I feel so happy and validated in my decision to get that vaccine. Having a baby in the middle of winter and peak sick season is slightly terrifying there were people at the hospital I delivered at with RSV. 3 days postpartum I wound up having to go to a different ER due to some chest pain had to bring baby with me due to breastfeeding where we were again informed that individuals on the unit had RSV. While a vaccine does not guarantee immunity I am incredibly grateful I made the choice to get the vaccine while pregnant because it has provided my baby with even a little bit of protection to such a scary virus especially when having to expose him to these potentially dangerous environments. Just thought I would share as I am sitting here reflecting on the decision
11898,The same happened to me. No issues with second dose. Yes....better than shingles
11899,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: I had no issues with the second shot
11900,A number of people I know got shingles after the con shot.
11902,Had anyone had successful help from a low dose ssri to help with the post shingles nerve pain? My pain is not caused by stimuli it just comes and goes at random. Seems to be worse at rest. 18 days post rash. Thanks
11904,Hi guys..was having like many others lower pain in my right back..pain so rehabilitating I could not walk. After a few days I had to take Ambulance there and everyone was pre diagnosing me w kidney stones..I get the typical urine cat scan blood work they say no kidney stones just call it muscle pain.

I also started a stool softener a few days ago too..please any info suggestions preferably love and support because this is horrible. Thanks Guys A guy in more pain than imagineable Mike
11910,Shingles vaccine: Yeah and it feels like you have gotten the shit beat out of your arm with a bat. Knot for a week. But.. getting shingles oof
11911,Good luck. I had shingles then took the shingles vaccine. I have had shingles twice since.
11912,Do you know if you had chicken pox as a child? If you know you had it get it if you are not sure you ever had chicken pox i would get it . I had my first case of shingles at 42. I did ask my pcp last year if I should get the vaccine he said yes to avoid it again. Got my 2 shots.
11913,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Same. But like most, seeing shingles being my dad to his knees sealed the deal. I couldn't get the 2nd shot fast enough."
11914,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Same. Wait until the second one. My pharmacist told me to do the shots on a three day weekend. After my first one in October I took the second one on my week break from work between Christmas and New Year. Glad I did.
11921,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Man you old enough to get the shingles vaccine? I am so jealous. I got shingles when I was 43. expressionlessface
11923,So I got the shingles at 49. They suck BY THE WAY. And yet I am planning on going back to work on Tuesday. C'mon I got a 3 day weekend to get better. Plus staying home gave me more time to work on my masters degree. Time off is for poseurs. I am Generation X. If I die I will still go in for another 2 weeks. Also get your shingles shot. My skin looks like lizard scales and it really hurts. Like a lot.
11924,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles and it sucked. Got the vaccine a year later and it was just a shot. No reaction to either shot.
11928,Flu RSV and COVID cases are set to rise soon so when should you get vaccinated?: I Have had all 3 in the last 8months. All first times too and Covid absolutely fkd me I ended up in hospital. I Am not an vaccine but I do not think Ill bother with any more boosters. My viral load was so high I was testing positive for 10 days. I have not heard of anyone testing pos that long since Initial break out. I Have never had flu injections and never been too bad and RSV sucked but was manageable.
11929,I am a 74yearold nonsmoking female. I have no diseases or illnesses. Three days ago I started feeling a slight pain above my left breast. At first thought it was gas. It did not respond to any medication. Double the size in the area of pain and a little more intense so I figured it might be pleurisy. Called my doctor to see how to treat it. Was told to go to the ER. I could not leave the home for another reason. So waited it out. By that evening the pain has started going under my left breast and was so intense I could not lift my arm or turn my shoulder in any direction. I drove myself to the ER. They tested for me for everything. The pain continued to move to my upper left back so intensely that I screamed all the time. there were no positive results with the test and eventually after several days of testing I was told it was probably shingles. I have been completely vaccinated from shingles. But was told I still could get it. I also have absolutely no rashes and was told I still might have shingles. I Have been in the hospital four days with no conclusive results. I know the doctors do not know what else to say because they do not know what it is. They started giving me a medicine for the shingles and I have improved somewhat. I think they are going to send me home today still in severe pain. I do not know what to do. They Are going to do a test for singles but I Have warned me that because I have no rash. The test is not very good. when I go home I feel like I Have been let go with no one looking out or trying to find out what is going on with me. I Am afraid. And I told the doctors that. What do I do? Any advice would be appreciated
11930,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My son was a 26 week old baby and I gave the doctors the go ahead to give to him. He is currently 16 months now I will say that it helps when cold season comes around he has to go in and get it now at his pediatrician office.
11932,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles after running a marathon at age 32. Virus in my hip join released and I got them on my right leg. Doc said I was the medical oddity of the month at the office. Was not too bad have not had a problem since.
11934,ALWAYS DRINK A LOT OF WATER BEFORE EVERY SHOT. I did before the two shingles shot I had NO problems at all. My husband forgot and he did not fare nearly as well. The water trick has kept me on necessary Polia shots for bone density. WHAT a difference H2O makes
11936,30YO with facial shingles first time: I am halfway through my 10 ... also battling a UTI. I am going to take them all as I also have MS and fibromyalgia and need to be as close to 100  as possible. This is bout number 6 BY THE WAY. Took the Shingrix series three years ago.
11937,Shingles vaccine: I had no reaction to either  just slight soreness at injection site. Get your vaccines while you can
11939,31F So I am someone who had the gardisil vaccine and I get my Pap smears every year. I had my first abnormal Pap smear in 2022 LSIL colpo came back CIN 123 CIS had LEEP and my margins were clear. I tested negative on my pap last year but still hpv not 1618 or 45. Doctor wanted to do a colpo but opted out because I did not like the fact she waited two months to tell me my results. Tested again this year. Negative pap Hpv. I have to go back for a colpo. I Am going to go back and get it because I trust this new ob is staying on top of it. I Am just curious has anyone cleared beyond the 2 years? I Am just frustrated that my cervix keeps getting scraped and no one is telling me how to rid of this virus. I also am ghsv2.
11940,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I also had it in my early 30 s. Mine was a small patch near my knee and it was awful. Combo itching burning stabbing sensation.
11943,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Dad got the shingles vaccine and got shingles a week and a half later.
11945,Its shingles. This pic is from a friend that got vaccine Now healing after a dose of more medication
11946,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I remember laying in bed shirtless because it was too painful to wear a shirt and I could feel the breath from my nose roll down my chest like it was stabbing me with needles. I wish I was able to get the vaccine. Both my wife and I got shingles before 30.
11948,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Got both shots and still got the shingles
11949,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Oof ocular? Did Not even know that was a thing. Thank goodness I only had the excruciating pain on my chest abdomen and back.
11950,Cin1Cin2 have anyone gotten the Gardasil Vaccine: I am in America so I was around that 1012 age range when it was rolling out so I did get the gardasil vaccine and am dealing with Cin1 right now.
11953,Put me out of my misery.: I have shingles on my neck. In 4th week. Only WISH I had taken the vaccine. Covid vaccine and boosters made me so sick I kept putting it off. I Am in a different hell. Feel better
11955,Shingles vaccine: Sounds like so many varied experiences I think I am going to still plan to get it on Wednesday and not wait because I have planned to get it twice before and the first time I came down with Covid and the second time I ended up needing to go out of town urgently. I do not think anywhere in my post I said I was considering not doing it but a lot of people made that assumption. I am definitely getting it but was just wondering if my Thanksgiving would be ruined or not. Now I know that it is entirely possible I will be sick as a dog and it is also very possible that I will feel fine. I guess we will see
11957,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: got my second vaccination a couple of weeks ago. hopefully it is no longer a concern for me
11959,First time shingles: I want to upvote you twice for your description of the pain. Something I was not prepared for really hits.
11962,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Just about that last part colonoscopy was anxiety ridden but afterwards I was loopy as hell from anesthesia and paired with the good news I received that nothing was wrong with me it was actually an enjoyable experience. I walked out with my buttcheeks out of my medical gown and ordered 4 hotdogs from the street vendor. I do not remember doing that my mom told me.
11966,Shingles vaccine experience: I get them along my trigeminal nerve and describe it as lightning crackling under my skin or flames on the side of my face channeling Madeline Khan in Clue. 49F have had over 30 outbreaks in the past 6 years and trigeminal and occipital neuralgia as a result of the nerve damage and insurance still will not approve the vaccine for me. Get it when you can folks because this really sucks.
11969,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Same shots did not affect me at all.
11974,I have been putting it off for 9 years... guess it is time. Friday's the day. I fully expect it to suck but not as much as shingles so there is that. Anyone else about to go through the same? EDIT I am just about 24 hours vaccine and... nothing. Injection was no worse than any other injection arm is a little sore but moving it around makes it better no fatigue no feeling sick just... nothing. FWIW my doctor told me that her patients who had asymptomatic chickenpox generally have reported no reaction. I have antibodies to chickenpox but according to my parents I never had the illness and I do not have any telltale scars. So maybe she is right. Will report back in October when I get dose 2.
11978,Thank you. Yes his current condition GBS was a side effect of the Covid and Shingles vaccine he was given. This has been confirmed by the doctors at the hospital.
11979,I developed shingles in late January went through weeks of hell and have now developed PHNits tolerable and mostly gives me trouble at night like a vampire. I was on 1200mg of gabapentin daily and now down to 300mg at night. I Am looking forward to getting off it completely but will stay on it as long as I have this neuralgiahave no idea when that will go away. After reading on this forum that some get shingles again I really want the vaccine. Can someone tell me when the vaccine is recommended after shingles? Can I get it now even though I Am still suffering the aftereffects? Thank you in advance for your answers.
11982,Shingles Sucks: OMG Me too Just twice. But the first time was over 20 years ago and I got the flubad. Probably the worst but just the flu. The second time was last year. I Am much older and have a lot of health issues. Autoimmune and several conditions and that is why I got the vaccine in fact. I found myself feeling bad all the time but I never really got the flu again. So I got it and prior to the neuropathy I remember wanting to cancel on my plans to go out. I just felt bad. I did not put that and the vaccine together until I felt the tingling and remembered the questionnaire.
11983,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: You just made me warm and fozzy.
11987,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got my shot days after my 50th birthday. Shingles is no joke.
11989,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I do not remember many adverse reactions. But I said F it and did the shingles COVID and Flu all at the same time. I remember feeling not fantastic. But with 3 things in me at once it was hard to say why I will say I do not recall feeling any worse than when I got a COVID or Flu shot previously.
11990,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I was lucky. All I got both times was a sore arm.
11993,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the chickenpox vaccine and I still get shingles
11997,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: There is an age limit. At least in FL. Must be 50 or be immunocompromised. I was 34 when I got shingles and no one would give me the vaccine. I had a pretty severe case that crossed my midline over my heart. Had to see a cardiologist and everything. Now I am 43 and finally received it via my doctors office. They had to special order it because they do not carry it in office since they always just send people to the pharmacy.
11998,There is hope I promise My story with these things is very long Long story short I was a healthy happy 47 year old woman weighing 115 lbs that literally had no worries financially and mentally until I found these. I was struggling with energy and pain I bet most of you were too I Am 1 day out of detox. I Have tried so many times but it seems to get worse. Its like your brain knows its wrong but they have such a grasp on ya. Short story. Started taking a couple months before having shingles on Thanksgiving it helped amazingly for pain and needed more. After a bit it did not work with recommended dose. Fast forward to end of April or May cannot remember when it was. I dropped to about 85 lbs and was so weak not leaving couch. I was rushed to ER. Ended up there 4 days with pancreatitis hiatal hernia dehydration and more. Tested positive for Percocet. I told them impossible Which technically was true. But nope I did Mind you hiding I was taking Feel Free. But finally came clean with my Dr of 30 years. Embarrassed But the drs do not have a clue about them. So he said let us get it out of her system and hit fluids hard. I walked out feeling pretty good. Smh that did not last long. Asked my amazing hubby to buy me a couple and took it driving out of hospital after he picked me up. Well it gets worse.. now it is about mid August I was taking 610 maybe a day. Cannot function without freaking out. Granted I Am dropping more weight. I hit rock bottom a few days later. My eyes started rolling in the back of my head. Could Not walk to the bathroom because I was so strung out and could barely make it to bathroom without almost falling over. Praying no one stops overPuking so much and sleeping on bathroom floor just a few days before I had enough. My oldest daughter blocked me on Saturday August 17th. Which crushed me So Monday August 19th night I texted my youngest daughter I cannot do this anymore I Am going to die Told both hubby and her I Am going to check into detox tomorrow. I do not think they believed me Tuesday morning came and I was scared Daughter texted me a number about an hour drive away. Well they did not take our insurance. Most places will refer you to another place. So about 100 I call new place and they accepted insurance. Ok I said and paused for a few thinking but I cannot But said ok what time can I check in? He said you pick. Ok 8pm Ok see you then Ill send ya a email what you can bring. Well my dizzy butt could not read it. Sent email to daughter so she could read it. She stepped upSo I changed it to 600pm because both her and hubby got off early. Oh Crap what did I do? Took a couple more. Might as well go out with a bang. Sorry I guess my short version is kind of long. Within 2 minutes my oldest texted me mommy I Am so proud of you and love you so much. So 300 hubby gets home and daughter comes over I was strung out on couch. Daughter packs and we are out the door. Laid in back seat the whole trip and took my last 34 of a bottle. We get there and I sign up for 7 day detox weighing in 70lbs. Hugged and kissed daughter and husband telling them I love them and crying. Walked in that door. Stripping myself down naked in front of a stranger. Peeing in a cup. I TESTED POSITIVE FOR MDMA WHICH IS ECSTASY OR MOLLY I Am not playing victim but I did not buy street drugs I bought a legal gas station product. I HAVE NEVER TAKEN ANY STREET DRUGS Put in scrubs no bra or underwear So get the grand tour and went to kitchen felt weird and set my meal on table and all hell broke lose. I was standing up and set my head on table. Two amazing woman grabbed me and I said I need to lay down well about 3 feet away from my bed I said I cannot breath everything turned black and boom I was out cold. Thankfully the two amazing women caught me and went down me unfortunately. But I did not hit my head thank goodness. Wake up in the bed with so many people hovering try to wake me up and taking my blood pressure. It was so dangerously low. Granted I normally have low blow pressure. But not 6857 Me begging them do not send me to er but they tried to make me stand to get a better pressure with no luck. Well I got wheeled out on a stretcher heading to hospital with in an hour after meeting everyone. How humiliating But it was it is. Get back early Wednesday morning about 1 or 2 am after receiving a couple bags of fluids. So in a detox or rehab facility you are put on a 5 day black out to everyone. Phone gone Zero communication. Wednesday and Thursday was rough but kept pushing fluids and eating constantly. When I say pushing fluids I pushed so hard. It was water juice Gatorade boost then Id start over again water juice Gatorade boost. I was a huge Pepsi drinker before getting to detox. I started drinking coffee. WTH I HATE COFFEE So I busted my butt to gain weight I mean hard. I went days without sleeping. It was hard but I wanted to prove it can be done in 7 days because normal rehab is 7 days detox and 30 days rehab. So Saturday I weighed in kitchen and so many people were around. I weighed and I was about 89 lbs. I gained 19 lbs in 5 days. Everyone was high giving me highfives Monday morning the day before I was supposed to leave. I weighed myself again holy cow. I was 97 pounds that is a 25 pound weight gain in 6 days. I have not looked back. Left detox a day over drama and being threatened. That Is a whole other story. But rule of thumb at the center if you do not feel comfortable or threatened remove yourself from the situation. They tried to get me to stay so hard and I said no I Am leaving after telling them what happened. They kept pushing and about 10 minutes later I told them enough and ask them what your rule if you ever you ever are uncomfortable or feel threatened? They said ok I know if anyone can do it you can have an amazing life I stood up and said i am going to get this stuff banned mark my words I Am calling my state representative because he has grandkids and I guarantee he does not want them to get a hold of it Again if anyone can you can do it they said. Well daughter picked me up and within 5 minutes of leaving detox I was on the phone with my state representative who I know a little bit. I told him my story reluctantly because I still was ashamed and embarrassed. Thinking how the hell did I end up in the situation? He said do not be embarrassed. I have grandkids and I do not want my grandkids to get that. So come November hes going to write up a bill when they go back in session and bring it to the floor. He asked if I wanted to testify and I said yes reluctantly but it is what needs done. It is now Tuesday August 15 2024 and I weigh over 100lbs. Feeling amazing I will never take another Feel Free. Plus it would be embarrassing after I pushed to bring a bill forward. I know I Am only 7 days clear of that toxic stuff. But I am persistent I honestly feel so much better. No cravings just feel so much hatred for Feel free I Got it taken off shelves at one store already. But going to try at other stores. I know I got a long road ahead but literally the hatred for those things has consumed me and I am done It will be hard be hard but you have to quit when you are ready. It has to be on your terms Good luck I hope this helps. Godbless
11999,"Second Shingles Shot: Same here. First one knocked me down for a few days. Second one, I had a headache about 12 hours in for a little bit and that was it."
12000,Shingles vaccine experience: A friend just mentioned her experience to me  extremely sore arm for the first vaccination then no reaction for the second.
12001,What did it feel like for you when you took your first dose?: That was the first day and I took it in the morning so I felt the immediate effects because I was awake. I now take it at night.
12002,I am on day 10 I think of this awful stuff. Anyway I just took my last Valtrex pill this morning. I discovered capsaicin ointment yesterday. Omg it burns like crazy but I think it is helped. Anyway I could tell this morning that the rashes are drying up some. When the rashes clear upgo away is that it?? Am I done with shingles?? I am trying not to Google too much but it is hard sitting here with nothing to do. I am a kindergarten teacher I have missed a ton of work. that is stressing in itself but anyway might be a dumb question but thought I would ask I also have psoriatic arthritis so I cannot take the vaccine because I take methotrexate weekly. Thanks in advance.
12004,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My husband was taken to a pox party by his mom and he got chicken pox. He got such a bad case that his brain swelled. He was in the hospital for days and the excruciating pain is his first memory. His mother regrets it terribly. It is what everyone was advising at the time so she thought she was doing the right thing.
12005,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Yes so true and I am glad it is over I am still pretty tired and yucky but not sure it is from the shot Thanks
12006,Did flu Covid last Friday evening all ok. Shingles last year that had a kick. Mine was a 2 shot 2nd half a month later.
12007,"Terrified of relapse/new occurancr with covid vaccine: I unfortunately got shingles in March of this year. It was the worst experience ever, shingles themselves weren't bad but the flare up of the virus in my body caused 3 months of post viral issues. As a result, I've held off on my covid vaccine so not to upset my immune system. had covid in summer 2020, so Wasn't in a giant rush, but now thinking it's time to get vaccinated. I however have seen the many stories of shingles flare ups after covid vaccines and am Very worried to get mine as a result. Should I be ok since I JUST had them? Or does that actually make it more likely they'll flare up again? Any advice to talk me through this would be much appreciated."
12010,I had once and it was so terrible experience so I want to get vaccinated but I saw a post about shingles postvaccination. Is this kind of side effect common?
12012,Absolutely the same happened to me. I was front line worker got early shot of pfizer then shingles 2nd shot shingles 4 times
12015,Shingles Vaccine: No issue here but it will probably knock you out. It took me down for 2 days
12019,Shingles vaccine experience: I describe it as having the worst sunburn of all time and somebody putting jumper cables or even mouse traps on it non stop so painful
12021,Shingles and other Vaccines: My mom and sister had shingles at the same time. It looks awful and sounds even worse. I will take a day or two of feeling kind of yucky over weeks of it.
12025,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Oh interesting so you like only took a pain med on the days you felt pain? Did you notice any effects from doing that? Like withdrawal or anything? I Am curious to inquire with my doctor and maybe see if that is an option for me. I Am on 50mg Pregablin and experience nothing some days and crazy pain others. I honestly feel like it would work more on the bad days if I only used it on bad days. Only thing is I did not take it once and had nausea and dizziness which I think was withdrawal so I never did that again I do not want to experience that again.
12026,Meh responder food noise at end of week: I think it is fairly normal to feel snacky toward the end of the 7 days. I take my shot on Saturday and I feel like eating all day on Thursday. Friday actually is not as bad as Thursday for some reason although it is not great either. But I try to keep acceptable snack foods acceptable to me might be different for you on hand such as celery sticks carrot sticks etc. Just try to munch your way through it without undoing all your good work that week.
12028,I Am literally drowning in anxiety and I Am posting to share my experience and hopefully find support from others who may have been in my shoes in the past. 20 years ago I had CIN2 hrHPV and my dr did a laser ablation. After that I had all negative Pap tests and at least 1 negative HPV test which was 3 years ago. I have had 5 children in the past 11 years most recently 8 months ago. I Am 45 now. Much to my surprise I had a Pap test a month ago which showed no thing abnormal but the Dr did an Hpv test that came back positive for hpv16. Then she did a colposcopy  CIN3. A couple weeks ago I had a LEEP and the results were CIN3 extending to the endocervical margin. The dr office sent a message that they will schedule a follow up to go over the results and any other procedures or surgery that might be recommended. I Am shocked that this is happening. I Am in a monogamous marriage this has to be a case of Hpv reactivation but 20 years ago they did not differentiate by strain. How could CIN3 just appear like that? I made the mistake of going down the Google rabbit hole and now my anxiety has me convinced I have occult cancer and even if I do not I Am going to get some form of Hpv 16 cancer because obviously my body did not clear it. I ran out and got the first dose of gardasil after reading some studies that seemed to suggest it could be therapeutic. I Am a mess. Someone please talk some sense into me. What is going to happen to me?
12035,: Amazing. So many people do not want to hear startling information. They want to keep their heads in the sand. that is the response I get whenever I try to inform people I know about the mrna vaccine and all of the horrible things that it has been causing to so many people including myself. You do not know what to do with this information.
12040,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My baby got it because she was in the NICU due to shortage this is the only way to even get one in our area. She is 7 weeks old now and no issues. And even though I was very sick when she came home from the hospital and I do all of her care she never caught anything from me. Still has not been sick so far. Maybe just good luck but also maybe because of the vaccine. Its a very bad RSV season so I am very grateful she was able to get it.
12042,Cake Ants and Whatnot: I watched nona grace also today I do not remember my shingles.Shingle shot hearty navel.Like most of those shots the flu and also my arm is sore for a few days afterwards..
12044,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: No party but my mom definitely hoped the three of us would get it at the same time. Well my younger brother got it first so of course she wanted me and my older brother to be in contact with them. She regretted that later when I ended up with raging fever and the damn pox every where. I had them in my mouth and some on the back of my throat. I was so sick. I was one step away from hospitalization per my pediatrician. I Am so sorry you have shingles. That is so painful. Hopefully the meds work for you and they resolve quickly.
12045,"Shingles at 22: So sorry you are going through this, it sucks! I got it my first time at 22 as well (37 now). Hang in there, I hope you are feeling better soon!"
12046,Had them already. Pneumonia 3yrs 2nd dose of shingles in June.
12051,"Shingles Vaccine?: Shingrix isn't a live vaccine, unlike the chicken pox vaccines available so it's safer for older populations. Zostavax is a live vaccine that's stronger than the typical chicken pox vaccines but I think its use has fallen out of favor for shingrix in most countries. They're all ultimately boosting your immunity against the same virus. One of the reasons the shingles vaccine is so important currently is because the most at risk population didn't receive the chicken pox vaccine as children; it wasn't out then. And of course our immunity can weaken as we age. Shingles in younger people is more common in times of stress or illness because their immune system is weakened."
12053,Reacting to Shingles vaccination?: was it the live shingles vaccine or shingrex? we should not get any live vaccine any vaccine like many other factors can stimulate the immune system and because us issues. i had ocular MG and doctor recommended getting up to date on all vaccine i started with shingrex within hours i felt an immune system reaction slight numbish feeling in my upper lip i have had it before when very ill. from that point on bulbar symptoms progressed quickly. by 10th day i was in ICU with a crisis. i do not recall any fever chills or other symptoms that would make me think flu cold or infection but each of us will have different immune system reactions.
12054,Hmmm...I have had the first dose of Shingles but not the second. I do not remember ever having a reaction to any vaccine either. Just got the pneumonia and the flu vaccine a couple of weeks ago.
12056,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: The concern for a lot of people is how new it is like approved within just the past couple of years. It also slightly increases the risk of preterm labor. I did end up getting it and am glad I did but I did a lot of research first to make sure I was comfortable whereas for other vaccines like TDAP I did not give a second thought
12057,Context Diagnosed fall 2023 not enough bands to meet CDC guidelines but functional med doc started treatment for Lyme. They suspect infection was a long time ago maybe as many as 20 years also diagnosed w mold toxicity active Epstein Barr Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Could Not tolerate doxy started vitamins for nutrient deficiencies added low dose naltrexone added Beyond Balance MCBB1 titrating up one drop at a time over several months severe increase in stress moving started having fainting episodes suspected vasovagal syncope possibly POTS after progressively feeling better suddenly felt much worse turned out to be shingles stopped taking everything except low dose naltrexone really just to avoid having to wean back on did quick run of antivirals gabapentin for the shingles felt worse again after recovering from shingles added vitamin supplements back in one at a time no side effects plot twist started smoking cannabis medicinally IMMEDIATELY FELT BETTER and the good feelings sustained for almost a full month of upward trajectory. I went from totally immobilized to doing yoga every day again then a few days ago I added one drop of MC BB 1 back in. I got up to 4 drops yesterday and noticed I felt worse. Today back down to 2 drops I feel doubly worse. I had my first vasovagal syncope episode since before I stopped the herbs. I am going to back off to one drop again until I feel like I Am tolerating it. But my question is it even worth it? All signs point to me having had Lyme since I was a teenager but I somehow kept it dormant most of the time. If now I can find almost full relief from cannabis and vitamins why would I even put these herbs back in? I feel like I got a glimpse of what it would be like to live a normal life again. And now in this flare it just feels like I Am doomed to be sick forever.
12060,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Same here got shingles 3 months after having OG COVID in 2020.
12065,I thought I was fine but maybe I am not. Absolutely exhausted.: I had a really down day of fatigueheadache whole body exhaustion on the 6th day of my antivirals. I felt on the upswing rash was clearing my lymph node swelling was almost gone but I felt terrible for an entire day. My shingles occurred a week before I was set to leave in a vacation so I was anxious about being able to rest and getting better before the trip. Got To remember your body is still fighting the virus and that takes time. Take care of yourself and rest as much as you can.
12066,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You too? I have a lump of chicken pox scar tissue right at my hair line. I scratched one of my bumps REALLY damn hard and I have had it ever since. Normally it is not an issue until Summer months when I shave my head. More than once I have accidentally lopped the top of it with my razor and bleed like a stuck pig for a bit.
12070,"Long term Ramsay Hunt effects?: Rhs is a severe complications of shingles of the trigeminal nervr. Time will tell if it fully recover or it become a long lasting condition. Steroids help reduce the inflammation on the nerves,"
12071,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: My parents were not anti vaccine and I got all my vaccines at every stage and then got shingles at 2021. Its not common for young people to get the shingles vaccine. Shingles absolutely SUCKS. I had it on my neck and even one hair falling and brushing against it would bring me to my knees. I Am so sorry you are dealing with this Your moms actions and position also sucks but I do not think she is necessarily to blame here. But I will agree that she sucksssss otherwise with her anti vaccine stance.
12073,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I am 47. I had shingles a year ago on the underside of my right arm and slightly down the right side of my torso. Worst pain I have ever felt.
12074,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles two NYEs ago. I went to bed with a slight itch on my ribs but I thought it was contact dermatitis. Took a sleeping pill and woke up the next morning with an angry red sore the size of a large apple that ached like hell. I rushed to the ER and they gave me the max dosage the ones for HIVpositive patients. I think they just did not want me to return to the ER when they had a skeleton crew. In the next day it had grown a tiny bit but ached less. From that point on the red dots became larger but also less achy. Still it was a bitch because it was under my arm and I would hit it all the time. I was instructed to never touch it change my shirt twice a day and wash it with Lisol. And never touch lesion and then my face. It was a week in agony. If not for the max dosage it could have been much worse if it had progressed. So of course I took the vaccine as soon as I could 6 months after break out and convinced 7 people to do the same as soon as possible. Just by seeing my pictures they were horrified and paid out of pocket.
12075,41 and got Shingles: I had natural pox in 2nd grade. And then I got the Shingles at 31. Lay on a heating pad it helps.
12077,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I also had whooping cough as a kid.
12078,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: Absolutely I tried to get the RSV vaccine myself while pregnant but my due date was too late in the year and by the time I PPROMed it would not give my body enough time to get her the vaccine. She got it at her 7 month apt and got hep b in the NICU.
12082,[Article] Antibody Persistence and Booster Vaccination of a Fully Liquid Hexavalent Vaccine Coadministered With Measles/Mumps/Rubella and Varicella Vaccines at 15-18 Months of Age in Healthy South African Infants: * **DOI:** 10.1097/INF.0b013e318292f7b1 * [**URL**]( <url> )
12085,Did this years flu shot tear anyone else up?: Tdap and rsv have hit me worse I think. I legit cannot sleep and I Am in so much pain I Am going to take Tylenol I Am genuinely so miserable I would get them again if I had to for my baby but I never want to go through this again
12086,Had a routine pap my previous two were fine and came back with LSIL and positive for high risk HPV not 16 or 18 I did get the vaccine when I was younger. I kind of feel like I Am doomed dating wise now though I Am 27 so I was really hoping to find a long term partner soon but now I feel there is not even any point in looking till its cleared which is what 12 years at minimum. Even after that Id still have to disclose and there is so much stigma I basically feel like my whole life is now ruined and I cannot stop crying.
12087,: Omg I had the booster in November I had Covid over Xmas anyway so it did not work. Am I now at risk of having these clots? This is awful I will. Ever have another vaccine ever pensiveface
12092,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: I Am not a dad but I work in childcare. Get the vaccine RSV outbreaks have been getting worse and worse and I Have been seeing it outside of the off season more frequently. I have more students hospitalized with it every year I even got it back in December and it kicked my ass hard.
12095,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: It's still better than getting shingles. When I got the first shot, I didn't even have a sore arm. The booster did me in, though. Sick for 3 days with a fever and chills."
12098,What vaccines were you offered before starting a bcell depleter?: I Am 32 but I also have asthma. I got pneumonia flu and a covid booster. I never got chicken pox as a kid and I was vaccinated against it so my neuro said that I do not have to worry about shingles vaccine til I Am 50. My neurologist told me that I would need to get any vaccines 2 weeks before starting Kesimpta but left the decision of whether to get them or not up to me. The Kesimpta pharmacist I spoke with was much more persuasive? I guess? about me getting vaccines prior to starting. She highly encouraged me to get them. I just went to my pharmacy and got them all done at the same time 110 would not recommend. The vaccine knocked my socks off and I did not need a prescription for them. For pneumonia specifically my history of asthma and now starting immunosuppressant medication was enough for me to get it.
12100,You are brave. That shingles shot rolled over me like a tank but its better than actual shingles. May your experience be kinder.
12101,Shingles vaccine: I had the original shingle vac and got a mild case of shingles. My late mother got it on her face and looked like elephant man and almost blinded her. Take the vac. Everyone I know who took it said no big deal.
12102,"Just got my first Meningitis vaccine and had a bad reaction. Now I'm unsure about getting the second shot. I vaguely recall having a titer test done previously, but the results seem to have vanished from my medical history. My doctor mentioned that a positive titer would negate the need for the vaccine. However, a recent titer test post-first vaccine showed positive results. My doctor assures me I won't need another vaccine, but I'm not entirely convinced. Should I still consider getting the second Meningitis vaccine for optimal immunity?"
12104,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: You don't get shingles from someone but if you've never had chickenpox then you could get chickenpox from someone with shingles"
12107,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Not necessarily you can still get it again. I had shingles 7 years ago before I was old enough for the vaccine I went for a physical last month and my doctor recommended the shingles vaccine. I immediately said yes because having shingles sucks so hard and I had a light case Will get my second shot in January.
12116,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Had shingles at 27. Right on the nerve of my neck where it meets my jaw. Got the shingrix 2 dose vaccine a year later and had to pay 400 out of pocket because insurance would not cover it. Worth it because I do not want fucking shingles again.
12117,One week in: I did not get the classic rash so we are not entirely sure I had shingles but holy hell it was the worst pain I Have ever been in. I had a bike accident back in September and it was pretty much back to normal on my neck and shoulder. A few months ago I woke up with a muscle spasm from my cheek to the top of my shoulder. I felt ill and had the weirdest sensation on my neck and top of my shoulder. I also thought I over iced and stopped for a while. I had to take a month off of work. I did not sleep for a week and a half and my bipolar got out of control in addition to the pain. It does get better but its slow going. This app started the end of February and while I Am back to work I Am doing half shifts. I Am still having some nerve pain and muscle aches.
12118,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My husband got home from work yesterday and says Heytheres something wrong with my shoulder. Can you look at it? I pop his shirt up and boom big old stripe of shingles blisters. Were in our early 40s and both had chicken pox as kids vaccine was not available then. Hes said hes not in pain but that its a little burny and he did have a fever Friday night. Hoping it stays mild and does not explode further. Pox party or not if you were a kid in the 80s and went to school at all or had siblings who did you were getting chicken pox. The point of pox parties was so everyone got it at once got that pox immunity and did not have to deal with a longterm illness spreading bit by bit or getting a severe case as an adult. It probably was not smart but was the best they knew at that time.
12121,"50th birthday celebration ideas?: Okay fellow old people. I turn 50 next year. I have friends literally all over the country, and want to do........IDK.....something with all of them. I've never done ANYTHING big for any of my birthdays, and decided that damn it, I'm an adult with a good income and I can effing afford to, and I wanna, so I'm gonna. I was thinking maybe a huge fancy VRBO somewhere I love with all of them there, or maybe a trip to an amusement park within close range of all of them. My partner and I are already planning a big bucket list trip with just us and our kids. If you celebrated a milestone birthday with something splashy, what did you do?"
12122,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep. I got shingles when I moved back the United States when I was 25. The doctor said she had never heard of a person that young having them. Now whenever I Am stressed the spot that I had the rash hurts. Its like nerve pain. Always an indication to me that I need to chill out.
12123,TL DR did you get the shingles shot pre starting oc rev us? Yes I already checked with my dr. I m asking for people s experiences. Hi everyone I am switching from Vu merit y to oc rev us. I am 38 so technically too young for the shingles shot. In the round of second opinions I got months ago one MS specialist said to get the shingles shot pre oc rev us. I asked my current MS doctor and she said she recommends it but it s not required. Since my optic neuritis last Oct 2022 that lead to my diagnosis last Nov 2022 I ve been terrified to get any shot that triggers my immune system. My optic neuritis came on suspiciously close to my covid booster and my ophthalmologist neurologist said it could have definitely triggered the optic neuritis. Which if it did allowed me to catch this early so it s a good thing? I DIGRESS For those on oc rev us did you get the shingles shot pre starting? My doctor mentioned vaccines are less effective once I m on oc rev us and oc rev us increases your risk of shingles. Curious if others got it? Didn t get it? Etc? Thank you Update got my first dose
12125,My sister got shingles a few years ago despite being vaccinated was pretty horrible for her.
12126,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: Ahhh. Apologies as mistook undertones in your message. Some pro tips to help... vitamin d 3 should be always taken with k2 usually 5000iu d3 50 k2 and make sure suspended in coconut oil as a carrier in the pill amazon sells them First time EVER i got my lab d levels from upper teens to 50 Only change was adjusting to take that type of d3 k2 twice a week. Also check high argenine diets... i had my wife take 1000mg lysine a day who went from 12x a year cold sores same family as shingles to 1x a year if that My outbreak happened after i took chia seeds. I put it together and googled it sure as hell high argenine can trigger. And lysin counteracts argenine. Also chelated zinc 25mg basically predigested helps it get to intestines where its better absorbed and boosts immune system. Last vitamin c should only be taken alone preferred with dinner at night. And make sure its liposomal vitamin c Liposomal is fat soluble so digests slowly over 24hrs. Boosts effacacy signidicantly. I Have dealt with countless doctors and micronutrient specialists intensely the last 2 yrs. Very proof positive of these claims. Please check them out and hope they help you I Have had several come back onlinr and tell me the tips DID big time. Good luck on your journey friend
12128,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: For everyone else out there... it's now 45. Just lost my husband to CC so just get it done (and don't shit in a box, do the real deal)"
12129,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep. No vaccine for me either. It is so contagious and was so endemic that it was inevitable that you would get it at some point so getting it out of the way young was sensible. I am one of the super unlucky ones though who had it twice. Apparently my case as a toddler was not strong enough to give me immunity and when I had it again at 14 it was REALLY bad. It got into my lungs and stayed there and took my asthma from mild to severe. I had to be on multiple inhalers multiple times daily for a couple months and it took years for my breathing to go back to normal.
12130,I hate to tell you but the second Shingrix was worse than the first for me. And both were a butt kicking.
12142,Are you 50? Get your shingles vaccine. Studies have shown that people who get a shingles outbreak have a 20 greater chance of developing dementia. Links below.: Harvard studieslab's are funded by those that have everything to gain to push this idea that you will get dementia or any other illness if you do not xyz. Maybe it is true doubt it as 98 of those that get dementia never had shingles. That said shingles sucks My grandma had it very painful. I would get it for that reason seeing how much pain she was in while it went through it is thing. I have not because I get the flu vaccine and then get the flu that turns into pneumonia The covid vaccine I got covid within a week after getting it the first time and after the boosters. So I am on the fence on getting this one.
12143,i got shingles from a vaccine my mom to prevent it.
12147,I just found out that one of the people who got the flu shot had shingles presently and they still gave them the shot. They said it did not matter. I think that is kind of insane.
12151,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: In the course of my life I have broken bones been 2nd3rd degree burned over 30 of my body and had multiple dental operations. NOTHING was even close to as bad as the shingles. It feels kind of like the most insane itch that you have ever wanted to scratch but the pain is so intense you cannot bear to even imagine something touching it even air. Crazy and admittedly the doc said it was a pretty bad case but you do not want shingles ever.
12152,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Honestly the best karma was that wretched lady getting shingles from this I got shingles at 29 years old and it was the worst pain I Have ever had to endure medication free labor was easier I thought I was dying it was wrapped around my torsorib area.
12153,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it in my late teens and it was brutal.
12155,Shingles with PHN after: It really is like something horrible from a POW camp or something Horrific Harry from HELL LOL That is funny. I had a couple times where the flare would shoot through the roof of my mouth and down into my throat. The weirdest thing is I could right now with a piece of paper every single nerve in my face and where they go. I really hope you get better soon. I definitely know that day by day feeling. I started to lose track of time like I would be awake at 230 am and trying to nap when I could at like 8am. I am a morning shift person so everything becomes foggy. I at the height of it started thinking I could not do it. Like being a prisoner in your own body. The only thing was the attacks would get more time between which helped me get a little more optimistic about it. I really hope you get better
12156,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Yes I had it when I was 14 on the left side of my torso. It was horribly painful and gross. I got the vaccine 3 years ago.
12158,HPV vaccine while having MECFS: I had it and had zero side effects other than the normal arm soreness.
12159,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: The other week I got a weird scaly rash and was worried it was shingles coming on. Luckily it was just my skin not like a new product I had tried. Never been so relieved in my life.
12161,Shingles vaccine experience: I Have had shingles and I Have had the shingles vaccine. Shingles is much worse.
12162,Shingles: The valacyclovir is what I was prescribed every 8 hours. Okay I will take time to rest. Thanku. I am glad I am not going to die. Fever is 99.5 and chills and throbbing headache is a bitch rn. going to rest now tho. Just took some Tylenol pm that my boyfriend gave me
12165,It certainly is. This is my friend after vaccine Bern suffering for nearly 12 months with no real diagnoses last week shingles
12166,"Patch test, then got shingles - not related?!: Hi! I (30F) went to get a patch test done in hopes of finding an allergen responsible for perioral dermatitis. They put the patches on Monday afternoon. That evening, I had a new, itchy rash developing on my chin. By my removal appointment on Wednesday (yesterday), the rash was huge, painful, weeping, and itchy. Pain covered most of jaw. He removed the patches and diagnosed me with SHINGLES. He said the patch test and the shingles were unrelated, but I've never had shingles before and I'm an active/mostly healthy 30yo. Got prescribed acyclovir thrice daily. How is it possible they're unrelated? Do you think it could be something else? Note: I had chicken pox when I was 6 or so. Also he wasn't seeing any major reactions when he removed the patches. Final appointment to assess tomorrow."
12171,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine. As someone who has suffered shingles and then the twoshot round of vaccines afterward to guard against any reoccurence it is totally worth it. The shots hurt WAY less than the shingles.
12173,Shingles vaccine experience: I know a couple of people who had shingles. Way worse than my sore arm from the vaccine.
12174,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: I Have had it  it was the worst for arm pain except for a tetanus shot. I did not react otherwise to it. Id get it in the hurting arm because you may as well have an arm without pain.
12177,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My 27 weeker is now almost 1 9 corrected and we opted in for the rsv vaccines we do go in every month for it but it brings me peace of mind because they are seeing him more often anyway. We did have a little battle with insurance coverage but my pediatricians team is amazing they helped me tons to get it
12178,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: My husband 50 just got shingles and is having a terrible time with the meds. Headache and nausea. I got shingles at 42 in my eye do not do that.
12180,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: In late 2023 my otherwise super healthy 2yr was admitted to the hospital intubated and sedated for a week due to breathing issues from Rhinovirus the cold. How quickly fussy at bedtime turned into an almist 2 week hospital stay a medical flight being sedated for a week... I am taking every vaccine recommended Covid booster later in pregnancy just not 1st trimester and baby is getting them all too. Son is 3.5 now healthy and been diagnosed with asthma. He would had reoccurring croup since 17 months but it had never gotten that bad and we did not get a diagnosis or asthma referral until after the big hospital stay.
12181,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I came down with chickenpox but was given a shot or some sort of vaccine and i only had like 6 or 7 on my whole body. From what i was told the vaccine made the breakout very minor? I was given the vaccine because my brother had recently received a bone marrow transplant and his immune system was very weak. My mom kept me isolated in my room and my brother in his. I built a LOT of model cars and planes read books and was given countless rented video games to play from blockbuster to pass the time to keep him safe.
12183,Shingles vaccine: My father was diagnosed with shingles and was dead 3 weeks later. Get the shot.
12186,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: When I was still a hospital nurse I had a patient with shingles on top of their other troubles. Worst case ever saw. Open sores looked like a lot of her body was raw hamburger. Excruciating pain and hard to treat because it is right on the nerves. The nerve pain from shingles can last for years after the lesions have resolved. Get the vaccine folks
12187,Rash appeared about a week ago has gotten progressively worse but has not spreaded. Gets extremely itchy but not painful and no fever symptoms so do not think its shingles. Hydrocortisone cream or vaseline helps a bit with the itching but obviously has not actually helped. Taking a zyrtec every day also keeps itching at bay while I am at work but again has not actually reduced the rash at all. Tried benadryl last night and woke up this morning way early to extreme itchiness but also was out drinking which probably contributed to increased inflammation. I believe it was caused by using a different laundry detergent about 2 weeks ago because other than that nothing in my lifestyle has changed. Switched back to old detergent 2 days ago have not seen any results yet though. Was initially thinking it was hives never had them before but since antiallergies and hydrocortisone are not reducing it I am no longer confident that is the case. For reference 23m otherwise healthy currently on low dose accutane but no other meds good consistent diet active every day.
12191,If she really had shingles why the fuck has not she had the loser meth head take her to a doctor or hospital for treatment then? Same thing with her autism.: My grandmother had it too and the pain she was in was almost unbearable for her. Nerve pain is brutal
12192,Shingles after Shingrix: Yes I am aware. I caught chickenpox when I was 2. I am referring to how exposure to chickenpox can prevent or delay The consequence of living in a society where we vaccinate for chickenpox rightfully no regrets and having no shingles vaccine for people under 50 kind of bad means there is a large segment of the population at risk for getting shingles. Having to wait 48 years from infection to 50 to get an immune boost is kind of shit honestly.
12193,Shingles vaccine experience: Had a teacher in school who had childhood polio. She wore a leg brace and limped and had terrible pain in her hip and all her classes had to be on the ground floor because she could not climb stairs.
12194,I have had constant problems getting Horizon to cover my vaccinations that according to their website are covered. Their answer is always a coding problem or computer glitch. Today was the latest. I went to my pharmacy to get my second Shingles vaccination. They covered the first Shringrix shot but now they say I need to pay over 300 for this one. I told the pharmacy this makes no sense. They said there is nothing they can do because their records said I paid cash for the first one. I did not They just looked at the computer screen and then me and shrugged. Just unbelievable. I had one shot it will have to do. I am done with vaccinations. I am stuck with Horizon because that is the only option I have at my employer. Why must health care be so screwed up in this country?
12195,Posted here before about struggle with shingles on forehead eyelid and tip of nose. First got in July 2023 had the antivirals about day 3 and the sores crusted over and were gone within 2 weeks. Had recurrences every 3ish months never as bad as first because I get antivirals right away so just a couple blisters in original spots. October 2024 I Have had the blisters come back nearly weekly. As some heal new ones come in. I got on suppressive dose of Valtrex then Favic but still recurs. I Have finally been approved for vaccine but you cannot have active shingles. Immunologist yesterday recommended to wait 2 months from last flare up which seems impossible for me right now he noted in his recommendation that I can choose to get it sooner leaving the choice to me to weigh up risks of getting it when i am clear of the sores sometimes I have maybe 5 days between infections so that could be when I get it. I am scared because I cannot be certain I do not have an infection and wonder if anyone else has had it in between flare ups like this? I Have been off work since Oct so I am keen to get the vaccine and have this stop or at least have the infections spread out as I understand you can still get it after vaccine but they are mild. Please talk about your experience with vaccine recurrent shingles and especially shingles flare up after vaccine. Feeling a bit lost having the decision put back on me rather than help from the specialists as they did not give info about what happens if i get the vaccine soonerbetween flare ups. Also has anyone else had a near constant flare up like this for months? Info 33 female Australia Blood tests normal Taking antivirals and lysine daily and changed to high lysine diet Specialists seen Dermatologist Ophthalmologist and Immunologist
12197,Realworld evidence from over one million COVID19 vaccinations is consistent with reactivation of the varicellazoster virus.  The risk of developing shingles was 0.20 for the vaccinated  0.11 for the unvaccinated. The difference was statistically highly significant P  0.0001.: why would they warn you about something that probably is not a risk to you and at most was a 1 in a million chance? Available evidence suggests that this group has a slightly higher risk of infection with SARS CoV 2 and of poor medical outcomes from C covid 19 than the general population. you need to find better doctors. someone close to me has a rheumatic autoimmune condition un medicated and they were called specifically by their doctor and told to get vaccinated as soon as possible in late 2020 because of this condition. Its possible at that time it was not 100 proven to because higher risk but any doctor with half a brain could foresee it our healthcare system here is more personal i guess than USA and other parts of the world. My doctor called me also and told me to get vaccinated because of one of my own health issues on file which they would not need data for would just be common sense i guess asthma. our healthcare system in Switzerland is geared toward preventative care more so than just treating illnesses.
12199,"Getting two vaccines at once: 2022 flu + covid knocked me OUT for the whole day after, was in bed all day feeling pretty terrible. Did the same in 2023, and I barely noticed anything, didn't even have a sore arm (but the 2 people I went with to get shots felt crummy for a day). Got tdap recently and was a little tired but not too bad overall, but just got that one solo since that was all I was due for. But I think if you feel bad after vaccines, it makes sense not to double them up in the future! I sort of just want to get it all out of the way at once lol."
12201,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: i had one breakout that started above my eye on my forehead. still have the scar 15 years later. One lady told me i look like harry potter with my scar and glasses.
12210,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox by chance as a kid but I got shingles in 2019 at 33 years old after some extremely stressful months at work. I noticed a rash inside my left elbow. It then became itchy and all of my skin felt uncomfortable when I wore clothes. I had to wrap my arm in a bandage for a month. GET ANTIVIRALS as soon as possible I waited and it took me longer to recover.
12211,Hello everyone. So about a week ago I had some very unpleasant symptoms appear. I several pimplelike bumps by my right ear swollen spots on my neck and then I developed a rash on my neck as well. I was quite stumped to what this was. This was on Sunday the 24th. Also I found it on usual that it was horribly painful in the area by my ear. I went to an urgent care near me on Wednesday and I was told I had shingles. I was prescribed an antiviral Valtrex and some kind of nerve pain medication which I cannot remember the name of. My symptoms seem to have gotten much better. It seems my rash is going away or at least healing. I do not really feel any pain and basically have not it seems since I started the antiviral and from what I can tell it has not spread to any other areas. That said I am noticing a strange symptom. It seems like in the past 23 days my smell has been a bit more sensitive. If I wash my face with soap I can smell the fragrance of it quite strongly. I do not recall this happening before this. I have also noticed an increase with certain scents as well. Is this normal? Also I do not remember ever having chickenpox when I was younger. My mom who is the only parent that I have living is not entirely sure either but she said I may have had a very mild case of it and does not recall me getting a chickenpox vaccine. I think she said there was not one at the time? But she could have been wrong on this obviously. I would assume since I have shingles I must have had a brush with it at some point. Or possibly I had considered this scenario.... I do work in a hospital. This puts me at exposure for all sorts of goodies. My wife also works in the same hospital and has had unpleasant illnesses. I have also had pink eye. Would it be theoretically possible if someone had shingles with poor hand hygiene to spread it to me? There are nasty people here everywhere that regularly do not wash their hands. I would assume that it would not be unreasonable to say someone could have had it touched the infected area did not wash their hands and touched something and spread it to me. I do not really know.
12218,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I got it when I was 48. Six weeks of agony. Got the vaccine because I do not want to ever go through that again.
12220,"Second Shingles Shot: Yeah, I had no effects from either shot. The first time I got the Covid vaccine, I had heard stories of people getting knocked on their ass, and my wife was out for a day, but I only got the chills for about an hour. With both shots (Covid vaccine & second Shingles shot), I had expected to feel like shit. I'm relieved it was never that bad."
12222,Did anyones RA start out of know where and intensely? its been so stressful i do not know what to do: Yes About 68 weeks after having shingles. Hair started falling out and severe pain in my knees. I attributed it to being old 63 and cold weather. I went to California for a bit hoping the warm weather would help but it got worse. Mentioned to doc I would like to be tested for lupus as sister has it. ANA and RF came back positive. Got referred to rheumatologist and had positive CCP and 14.3.3 eta. Hopefully they can get you leveled out with the proper meds. Do Not skimp on self care Its not always easy to do but I Have realized its vital to my well being both physically and mentally until I get this under control.
12225,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: I have had 3 shingles outbreaks over the last ten years. They were very painful and caused me to have difficulty even just focusing on stuff. I have been waiting to get a shingles vaccine for several years now. I have been told repeatedly that they are only available for people 50 and older. I turn 50 this month and you are telling me that they are now available for people under 50?
12226,FML... I got shingles: Can confirm I had shingles this year and I Am 32 Felt like shit and was bed ridden for atleast a week and now have scarring on my neck from the rash
12230,Anyone here have a reaction to the shingrix vaccine.. Like a shingles type rash.. If so how long did it last for
12232,Postshingles neuropathy on my face is driving me insane 36: So sorry to hear this Shingrix post third bout here and now I have a new fear unlocked 3rd bout and Shingrix three years ago hubby just had his first in June. One little spot on his ribs but I commiserated his way through he knows mine were more widespread from front middle to back middle solid band of blisters for over a week. He has to wait two more weeks for the VA to give him Shingrix. I am NOT going to tell him what happened to you he poopooed Shingrix until he felt the first tingle then he asked if there was a shot for that. SMH
12235,Shingles after Shingrix: Got my 2nd shot last Thursday evening. My insurance would not pay for it so I just paid out of pocket in hopes of finally kicking this
12236,Shingles Vaccine: My wife has MS we both got COVID and shingles and flu. Only side effect was a sore arm for a day or so.
12237,Put me out of my misery.: I got the shingles when I was 12 during one of the hottest summers in Texas on my inner thighs only which just made me feel miserable. It certainly was not the most painful thing I Have ever experienced. The most painful experience I Have had was when I got hit by a drunk driver and it broke my clavicle my nose and fractured my hip. The hip still hurts like hell more than 30 years later.
12238,So I recently gotten shingles and do not know why. Never had chickenpox have a vaccine for chickenpox but I do not know if I have a weak immune system or have been under stress.
12242,Shingles on back family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: I have been afraid to tell anyone I have shingles because when I did they looked at me like oh no I am going to get it My arm is completely covered and I am scabbed over. I knew I should not have said anything. Most people do not understand how you get it. I had to convince her she would have to touch it and then touch her nose or mouth to get it. And the rash would have to be weeping
12244,My baby is 7 months old girl. She got beyfortus the rsv antibodiesvaccine when she was in the nicu at like 3 days old. She had marconium aspiration it was not super serious so she does not really have a compromised immune system and she was born at 39 weeks. Anyways she is been congested recently not severely I thought it was allergies because I was having allergies too. But recently she is been doing this low growl it sounds like wheezing but I associate wheezing with exhaling and she only does this occasionally she is also in the midst of a screaming phase I made a post about it a couple days ago so is her voice just horse? Okay and before anyone says take her to the doctor of course I Am taking her to the doctor tomorrow to get tested for RSV influenza I already did a Covid test negative. But its Sunday and I Am kind of freaking out so has anyone else has a similar experience?? Side note has not had a fever only symptoms is congestion which seems to come and go and the weird growlingwheezing which she does at random?? Like she will stop for hours then randomly just start again.
12245,Shingles and other Vaccines: Studies show that feeling sick after the Covid vaccine mean that your immune system is responding properly and you will be protected. I do not know if this applies to all vaccines. I researched this because I had felt nothing after the vaccine and I know I have a crappy immune system so that is bad news for me.
12249,I Am getting the vaccine and HPV vaccine at my pharmacy Exciting But I swear my upper arm hurts just thinking about vaccines. I Have gotten so many since 2020 had to get a bunch in Jan 2020 including MMR to go to MAE school
12250,b-L-1- uracil (L-BHDU) effectiveness against varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 depends on thymidine kinase activity
12252,Shingles Is NO Joke: My husband came down with shingles a few months ago. I am immunocompromised and was fearful of the vaccine but decided to do it. I got my first shot in December and was sick for 5 days. My next shot is scheduled for next week. I am preemptively taking 4 days off from work long weekend. I am fearful of falling ill again but its worth it. Shingles is just terrible. My husbands sores cleared about three months ago and he still complains about the neuralgia every day.
12253,RSV vaccine: That is kind of weird. My baby got that vaccine before she left the hospital. It was 100 covered by her Medicaid. And most if not all private insurance companies cover that vaccine 100 with no copay. I would just call your insurance company to see their coverage rules.
12258,FML... I got shingles: Shingles absolutely sucks. I had it when I was like 34 and it was as painful as everybody says it is. Luckily for me the medicine worked within hours
12262,RSV Vaccine NSW: I was waiting for the free roll out in NSW But alas no. Priceline pharmacist seems to think April will be the free one. So I got it two weeks ago at 36 weeks bit late but I will seem to have the full two weeks of antibodies sharing. I had no symptoms from the vac at all. My husband got it and felt super fluy for 24hrs. But his a big baby with vaccine
12263,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it at 5 and again at 11. At 11 my fever was over 104 and I was super sick for two weeks delirious for some of that time. I cannot imagine getting it as an adult.
12265,Shingles and other Vaccines: I got the Bivalent and shingles together once and had a cryptogenic stroke.
12267,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Had it on right side of face. On eye under eyebrow and hairline. 12 months on it still itches like crazy. And it wrecked my vision.
12268,Shingles vaccine: I got it and it was absolutely horrible. Eye forehead scalp jabbing pain in my head for a month and residual nerve issues which lyrica helped. Still have it almost 2 years later but much better. Pinkeye for almost a year. Fortunately no vision loss
12270,Relapse fears?: Hey there I have got it for the 3rd time now this year. Obviously its different for everyone but the 1st time was the worst pain and worst rash and the 2nd and 3rd time have been decreased size rash and less pain each time. Obviously you cannot predict if you will get it again but there is a chance if you do it will be like mine and just easier to handle each time.
12271,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Shingles is crazy how much it hurts. I have only had a small strip on my stomach. And it went away after 2 weeks but that was enough to know I do not want to get it again. I do not envy your 11 hour drive home
12276,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I do not get those vaccines most years. I have had shingles. My past covid and flu illnesses do not compare to shingles. I was among the unlucky 10 or so who had shingles in the eye and that has resulted in permanent eye damage. I am a big proponent of getting this vaccine.
12278,Family parties with newborn: I recently did the due diligence and waited until my LO was vaccine for our first eventouting a local art show opening at a studio I am a member of. Neither my partner nor I have family anywhere near close to where we currently live. Anyway Lots of people. I am the one who got sick two days later. Its also not fun taking care of a nearly newborn if YOU yourself get sick.
12279,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles at age 43. I had Covid that went right into shingles. And I had it on my trigeminal nerve. So it was on my head right ear and near my eye. Luckily I caught the rash in time to get meds. It was absolute hell the nerve pain on my head. I then was on gabapentin afterwards for nerve pain. And then my body got addicted to gabapentin and it was hell getting off that. If I could get that vaccine Id absolutely do it. Maybe I should look into the cash price? What Is interesting is my brother had shingles in his 20s. And I had a cousin who had it in her 20s. So something in our family has us getting it young.
12281,Shingle vaccine before JAK inhibitors?: I am about to switch to R in vo q and actually got my first dose of the vaccine this morning no side effects so far My rheum a to logi st is happy for me to start R in vo q this month as long as I have had at least one dose and get the follow up within 6 months. I had a shingles flare up a few months ago and if I never have another one it will be too soon. I still have nerve pain where the main flare was but it is manageable. If your doctor recommends you get the vaccine absolutely get the vaccine.
12285,Pain is insane please need some love and support: I Am so sorry you are going through that. My shingles were in the same place. The pain as so bad it felt like I had been speared with napalm. For me the gabapentin helped some but only when I took a double dose the doc prescribed 300 mg and took aspirin or another otc antiinflammatory. If the rash is painful apply hydrocolloid bandages and leave them on until they fall off. You can overlap them if you need to. They are made for applying over blisters. Ice really helps. Make flexible ice packs by combining 3 cups water with a cup of rubbing alcohol in a freezer bag and freezing it. Feel better
12286,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: I think if your fever has cleared up you should be good. I didn t have that reaction to shin gri x but I do have exactly that reaction every time I get a tetanus booster booster. I ve never had the fever come back after it goes away.
12294,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: YUP. My brother got the Shingles rather early. That was a warning sign for me to get the vaccine. People say the second shot wiped them out for a couple of days after but not for me. GO GET IT
12295,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine and to double check my parents took me to meet my cousin who was infected.
12296,31 yr old male: The old vaccine was a live virus and at least in the US it is not available anymore. Now it is Shingrix and it is not a live virus. Much higher efficacy rate. I had absolutely no side affects from Shingrix besides really painful arm but it was so worth it.
12299,Strange rubbing/rash like feeling beside my breast (not on the breast) with no marks: Go to the doctor. I believe if you get treatment for shingles early it can help. I would also recommend a shingles vaccine when you feel better.
12300,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My mom sent me to a chicken pock party I did not get them I was vaccinated in the 80s I finally got the chicken pocks when I was 16 and hospitalized still got my kids vaccinated it was a light version though
12301,Guy in grocery store does not want a free flu shot: I had shingles and was too young to get the vaccine even afterwards for several years. I agree with you worst pain ever. For me it was around where my bra was but the pain was in my back shoulder and felt like I was being pressed against a coat hook until the coat hook was coming thru the other side. I would lie in bed and just scream for hours until the pain would abate a bit. Rinse and repeat. Finally went to the hospital did not know I had Shingles because of the pain the rash and the fact that my lower legs had started looking like elephant legs and not from fluid buildup. They called in a tech to do a Doppler and could not find anything with my legs. They ended up giving me morphine for the Shingles pain because nothing else was bringing down my BPpain. Right before I left the doc gave me another dose of morphine and told my DH I would sleep for 12 hours. I got home and did eight loads of laundry. The bonus was they also gave me the antiviral drug though they felt it was probably too late as I had been having this for 2 weeks. It STILL worked and three days later was 85 better. On a bad note it triggered a few other things and I ended up with CRPS Fibromyalgia and CFS. The legs finally went down but it still feels like little elves live in my lower legs and burn my tibfib bones for firewood. Weird to have the outside of my legs cold but inside they are burning 247. P.S. I still believe this was all caused because some idiot shopper at BB who had piled their cart super high on BF did not watch and their heavy computer monitor fell from the top of the pile off and unto my lower arm. BB did not GAFF either.
12302,41 and got Shingles: My buddy got it at 36. He had no known immuno diseases but later developed IBS.
12304,Got my Shingles vaccine: I got shingles on my temples when I was 27. I had just started a construction job and I thought it was acne from the sweatband in my hard hat. It spread into my scalp because of the hatband and it was a nightmare. I lasted a few days before the pain told me something was not right. I made an appt with my doctor for acne because I still had. I idea what to call it. I got the vaccination in 2021.
12305,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Right??? I went to the Dr last weekend and was diagnosed with shingles and my husband had the same rash his just went away quickly and mine did not so I ended up at the drs. Both of us are in our mid 30s. And the nurse said she had shingles in her 30s as well and that it is becoming more common. The person who is being argumentative in the comments is ignoring the articles that come up on google stating that shingles is becoming much more common in younger people in recent years. I do not want to bother replying to them directly though because at this point they are just a troll But yeah the shingles vaccine would be nice for us younger folks
12307,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel better I got the vaccine and still got shingles when I was 27. So its no guarantee.
12310,Long Term Side Effects from Shingrix vaccination. Chronic ear pain dizzyness vertigo.: Wow I cannot believe this. I am going to show this to my Dr. and my wife. Its hard to convey this experience to others. I had the dizzy ness and went through a whole set of hearing tests as well. Again like yourself nothing was found. My PCP is saying that he is seeing the same thing with may of his patients. The symptoms ebb and flow. Pacing yourself helps a lot. I find if I have to go overboard I have to get rest as soon as possible to recover myself. I take daily analgesics for headaches and in fl amati on that I try not to miss. My ear infection has seemed to resolved as well as the night sweats after the ear infection resolved. Has your dizzy ness and vertigo resolved? I am taking vestibular therapy for this and it is work well. I will try to keep up with my exercises however as the treatment needs to be maintained. Did you get any post exercise malaise? It keeps your energy level low causing you to pace out your activities to avoid crashing. It seems to work for me. Thanks for your response or any advice you can provide.
12313,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I only got a sore arm with flu and COVID shots. Had my first shingles shot a few days ago and did not even get a sore arm. I guess I Am lucky
12315,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: I wonder if my PCP gives me the whole dose potentially making it more swollen and tender. I will be curious to learn what you find out. Last time I asked via telehealth a literal one min conversation cost me 210 I would love to avoid that again.
12316,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Got shingles on my 48th birthday last year cannot say it enough so glad to read this post get those shots Months of excruciating pain like no other no warning just unreal pain that nothing can touch I Am turning 50 in 2025 and will get the shots because you can get it again.
12317,Second Shingles Shot: Ugh. Yeah my son got chickenpox even though he was vaccinated. It was so mild we almost missed it. We had received a paper that a kid in his preschool class that was not vaccinated had it so I was on the lookout. He only had five pox on his back and a 99 temp. The pox never even bothered him. When I got it I was 12 and had hundreds of them in every orifice 104 fever aches and chills. I still have scars on my hands belly and face.
12318,Diagnosed this week going on Ocrevus told to get all vaccine: This is the way you DO NOT want shingles I have had them 3 times took Shingrix to avoid any more. I burned my second and final week of vacation 3 years ago over the second week of shingles went braless that whole week slumped over the left arm of my recliner shingles on right ribs taking 3600 mg. of gabapentin the whole time.
12320,Shingles vaccine: I got the vaccine and had no side effects at all. I watched my very bad ass husband go through agonizing pain for months with the shingles. I watched my poor Aunt get shingles IN HER EYE. I never want to go through that.
12322,New Zealand politicians and their immediate staff were exempt from requiring to be vaccine I took the shot so I could access buildings for meetings with Govt officials re State trafficked children. Suffered pericarditis and multiple bouts of shingles across left side of face.
12323,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: I have MS and fibromyalgia and ankylosing spondylitis. Yay a trifecta
12325,30F. Diagnosed with shingles yesterday. Kind Of wish this subreddit had a FAQ lol. A couple days ago I noticed a weird bumpy zit on my forehead treated it the normal acne ways panoxyl etc.... hopefully I did not screw my skin up too much here. Yesterday I woke up to half my forehead covered in similar bumpyraised patches with vague itchinessburnytingly feeling. Went to urgent care and even the nurse taking my vitals before the Doctor came in said oooh that looks like shingles Prescribed valacyclovir holy horsepills batman and told I can use hydrocortisone cream and not to cover with any kind of bandage. The rash extends from my just above my hairline kind of wondering if this is what caused a dandruff flare up in that exact spot a starting a couple weeks ago? down to my eyebrow Doc said if I experience any visual symptoms to go straight to the ER and then down to the area in front of my ear. Nothing has blistered yet just raisedbumpy tender skin that feels tight. The pain has been mild so far but the itching is intense. My lymph nodes are swollen behind my left ear and I woke up with a bit of an earache on that side but I am not sure if that is just from the pressure of the swollen lymph nodes or if I could be developing Ramsay Hunt? I am trying not to go too far down the rabbithole of here are all the ways things can go wrong and freaking myself out. Anyway some questions What to use for itch relief? Hydrocortosone does not seem to be doing anything getting some calamine today most things I am seeing advertised for shingles relief have menthol in them and my cat tries to eat my skin whenever I put anything menthol on it so going to avoid that lol What to use to clean skinface I have a Clinique facial soap will that be gentle enough? and for hair since the rash goes into my hairline I will discontinue the Nizoral I was using for dandruff since that is harsh I think I have some Nexxus Humectress shampoo will that be ok? Should I stick to cooler water temps in the shower? I am trying to stay in as much as possible during the course of the antivirals luckily I have summers off work friends think it will be ok for me to go over and play some board games since they had chicken pox as kids or the vaccine and it is only contagious to people who have not been exposed. Thoughts? Is there anything I can specifically do to prevent it spreading to my eye? I am washing my hands beforeafter applying any creams and not scratching the itch. Tylenol vs advil vs aleve? Sorry if this was a lot or some dumb questions lol love that this virus triggered by stress is causing so much more stress I am really just trying not to overthink but also not wanting to make this worse for myself. My mom goes between insisting I am too young to have shingles and prolifically apologizing for making me go to chicken pox parties as a kid. When she had shingles it was on her back and somehow did not have any rash so a very different experience. None of my friends have had shingles to get advice from. Thanks
12327,My shingles vaccine experience was a big nothing burger I feel more sore after a gym workout then from the vaccine
12330,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was vaccinated and my older sister was not. I think it was because my country did not start mandating it until later when it was my turn. Anyway my sister got it and the poor girl has the blisters everywhere and was home for so many days. I was like 5 at the time and my mom was trying to get me sick by sharing things from my sister. But I just never did. The vaccine is the difference.
12331,Shingles vaccine: Each person is different but i would not recommend it. A friend of mine got it and he was in continously pain for 2 months. The doctor said that there was nothing he could do.
12334,RSV vaccine is it now free in Aus?: My baby was just born and had the RSV shot. Two actually as he is over 5 kg.
12337,Shingles vaccine experience: No reaction to the first. have not had the second yet.
12338,RSV Vaccine: I Am originally from the UK when the Men BBexsero vaccine is part of the standard vaccines I think the first dose is given at 6 weeks there so I just assumed that it was the same here. I was shocked when I realised that it was not included so I gave it to bub as soon as I realised it was missing. I think he had the first dose at 8 months I do not remember any significant side affects. When I talked to me GP about it she said she does not you stand why it is not part of the standard schedule here and hopes it gets added soon as meningitis can be so devastating.
12339,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: Shingles was worse than the time I hurt my back.
12340,COVID Flu And RSV Vaccines Are Lifesavers. Why Are Not More Older Adults Getting Them? seniorsincluding many who live in nursing homesarent getting these vaccines.: I have a family member with dementia in memory care. During her coherent moments she constantly says she just wants to be dead she hates this life what is the point etc. She is aware enough at times to know what is happening to her and she does not want to prolong her life. She has very little joy left in her life. Most of the people in her facility are worse off. We get her vaccines and keep her health appointments but she has a DNR in her will. I used to be extremely cautious about her getting exposed to illness but now I sometimes find myself thinking What am I saving her from? I do still think it is unfair to risk all residents caregivers and staff by not vaccinating her.
12341,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Mind sharing why? Reason I ask is got 4 in one day few months back at Walgreenscovid flushingles1pneumococcal normal arm sorenessboth arms for few days.
12342,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I will be 33 in Aug I got chicken pox when I was 5yrs from school. I brought it homeaccidentallyto my 6 month old brother he got it. We stayed with our grandma she took care of us as she had chickenpox when she was young but our mom never had it could not risk getting it. We never went a chicken pox party but I heard of them. I think some of friends went to them. My brother got a scar on his face from one of spots I got a couple of scars on my chest from it. I was still am a sickly person so it was even worse on me than my brother. When was 19 I got shingles. It was so awful I wanted to cut my own leg off to get the pain to stop. It did not help that at first no one believed me about it refused to believe it was shingles. So I was in pain without any medication or help for a month before a doctor finally said it was shingles. Even now at my age they will not give me the shingles vaccine because I Am too young even though I already had it. Sadly chickenpox parties was the best people could at the time.
12351,I was on a vacation going to a concert  when I was showering afterwards I noticed a sharp pain in my leg and turned around in horror when I spotted this. I went to urgent care the next day  they said it was shingles and put me on a week of Valtrex. I Am worried to give it to my spouse. Hes been vaccinated since hes older than me. I Am 33 years old and did not realize younger people get this condition. They told me to put a bandage over it so its covered. I also noticed like two or three little spots on my arm as if I had a blood draw but they are not huge. I Am a chronic pain patient with a very rare disease  I Have been on a mixture of a fentanyl patch oxycodone gabapentin Robaxin and Celebrex. Even with all of those pain medications my leg still feels sharp pain as if its going to fall off and my feet are cold and numb. The pain was wrapping around to the front of my thigh. I do not know if I should tell my pain doctor to see if he can help any additional but so far the pain is no joke. I used to have some bumps there as if I had a spider bite on the back of my thigh here like easily a dozen times over the years. Could this be a repeated flare up? I read online it only happens once. If gabapentin also does not help what else do they typically prescribe?
12352,Cold sores aciclovir  mounjaro: I am on Aciclovir for Shingles and have noticed the nausea is a bit worse I suffer with it anyway and had a slightly upset stomach. Otherwise no real difference to normal in terms of appetite as in normal for my 10mg dose of MJ.

12355,My husband got shingles on his buttocks testicles and anus. He had the original vaccine a decade or so ago. Protection wore off. He and I were thrilled to get the new vaccine after his battle last year.
12356,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Late 80s i still have scars from it. It covered my body head to toe and my mom said it was even covered my mouth and throat. Waiting for shingles to kick in any day now
12357,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Get vaccinated because my mother got vaccinated and still got it. lol Reddit
12358,Background late thirties female. Sudden onset RA about 3 months ago. Otherwise healthy outside of occasional migraines treated by a neurologist and low thyroid on Synthroid for that. Just had a physical and all my bloodwork came back in the normal range outside of anticcp that came back over 250. My rheumatologist did the vectra test and it came back aggressive. I have 2 toddlers at home a demanding desk job and a husband who travels often thanks military so being functional is a must especially in regards to taking care of my kids. I have been on 15mg prednisone for 2 weeks which is helping no more fatigue but is not perfect. Joint pain is not unbearable anymore at least just unpleasant. Next Tuesday I officially start RA meds. I had the shingles vaccine 2 weeks ago per the doctor's instructions which is what he was waiting for before I start. He is recommending a jak inhibitor but told me if I prefer a biologic we can start there. We are skipping methotrexate for various reasons mostly due to side effects and his belief about it is efficacy in my case yes insurance approved this. I have no concerns about selfinjections so that does not weigh into my decision making. Nausea though is a big concern and it is a side effect that seems to hit me hard from many medications. Any thoughts about jak inhibitors vs biologics? My colleague who also has RA expressed concerns about the heart issues listed as side effects of the jak inhibitors but the doctor seems to think that is a low risk for me and they may be effective the fastest. I am just torn since biologics have been out longer and I am worried about some of the unknowns related to the jak inhibitors.
12359,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: My arm was more sore but it was tolerable. I did not feel sick or anything.

Long story short half my face was paralyzed completely for months. It did takes 3 months to recover partially and an other 6 months for the rest to go away. I needed to sleep with my eyelid taped to keep it closed so my eye does not dry out. I could not eat properly and my hearing was damaged but recovered after a while. I was terrified to get stuck like that. Because it is possible to keep aftermath. I Am lucky to have 95 recovered only me can see it now. Recently I Have got vaccinated for it shingles vaccine. So I encourage anyone to get vaccinated

12368,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: I had shingles last January at 46 years old. It was in my forehead spot near my eye spot on my scalp. It was horrible I still have PHN. I asked my PCP about the vaccine and she said to wait until I Am 50. I Am going to ask her about it again next month when I go in for my annual checkup.
12371,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Can confirm. Parents just wanted kids to get it when they were young and get it over with. I had chicken pox at age 12 almost 13. Not as an adultI was barely a teenand I was soooo sick and miserable. High high fever pox from my scalp to my toes even inside my mouth and other sensitive areas. I could not eat. I was so reactive and in pain that I could not wear clothes or PJs for a week. Could barely tolerate having a sheet over me. Lasted for 1014 days. Pox lasted weeks and left a few pock marks in spite of my efforts to not scratch. Some came off in my sleep. Our doc said I was lucky to have gotten it before becoming an adult as it is way worse then. I honestly cannot imagine what that would be like. Got shingles in my 40's. That was also very painful and lasted fur months. Now I am double vaccinated against shingles and hope I never see it again.
12374,Shingles Vaccine: I Am 60 years old and have had genital herpes for forty some years. The vaccines triggered an outbreak both times but I have not had any outbreaks since. Its about ten months now. I normally have a prodomal symptom and take one valtrex every couple of months.

12399,About to take my first dose Anxious: I paced around for an hour before taking a deep breath and doing it. Absolutely no regrets 5 weeks later. The worst part of the whole thing is that first shot.

I'm hoping these side effects are temporary and will subside soon. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
12408,Very recurrent herpesvirus HSV VZV ?... despite daily Valacyclovir what other preventive treatment should I take ?: Lol no. I had shingles when I was 50 and it was a small patch of blisters on my arm. That was it.
12409,I tried to mark this as serious but did not know how. So I am recovering from shingles. The pain is the worst pain I have ever felt. Back when I was first diagnosed the urgent care Dr prescribed Tramadol 50 mg every 6 hours. I was already taking ga to gabapentin 300mg 3 times a day. When I went to see my PCP he dropped the tramadol to once every 12 hours. This left me in pain for at least 6 hours between doses. I could not get another appointment right away so I started taking the tramadol again the way urgent care had prescribed them thinking ok that gives me enough for two weeks instead of four. By that time I should be well or at least get in to see my Dr. I had 6 pills left by the time I could get in and it was not even my Dr that I saw but she was nice. She called my pharmacy to authorize an early refill of tramadol. She prescribed it twice a day. Then she upped my gabapentin to 600mg 3 times daily saying that it would bring me relief. She also prescribed lidocaine patches. Insurance came up with reasons not to cover any of it. I had to pay for the tramadol and lidocaine out of pocket and could not even get the gabapentin at all. I tried again for only two tramadol a day because I know I do not have enough for every 6 hours and am still battling the insurance company. So now here I am a few days later getting 6 hours of relief and 6 hours of agonizing pain then another 6 hours of relief. Well the other day my boss told me I had to come back to work because she was drowning in paperwork. So I took my tramadol and went to work. She promised I could go home in a couple hours. I got into the work and lost track of time. I then felt the first sign of pain and realized that a little over 6 hours had passed. I needed to get home quick to lay down and spend 6 hours rocking back and forth crying and begging to die. I had almost made it home before the pain revved up to the point I could not make it to my door. I had to sit down in a chair put my head in my hands moaning and sobbing as quietly as I could. The local drug dealer walked by then stopped and came back and asked me if I was ok. I explained to him what happened with the insurance. He told me to sit tight for a minute and ran upstairs to his apartment. He came back down with a handful of huge white oval pills and a glass of water. He told me to take one right then. I did. At that point I did not really care if it killed me. He helped me to my apartment and then to my bedroom then left. I cried in pain for about half an hour until it faded and I fell asleep. An hour or so later I woke up and the pain was gone. I took out one of the pills googled it and found it was 600mg gabapentin. Now I am almost out and still fighting the insurance company. I am going to need more by the day after tomorrow.
12412,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Does that pain lessen or go away over time? I have a friend that ended up with a heat sensitive spot that would bother him whenever he bathed or showered. I wonder if there is a botox or something that can calm that spot down.
12417,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Worst thing ever Ill never forget the itch and the damn oatmeal baths.
12418,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: 3 days down and out. 2nd shot was not as bad but waited the entire 6 months between shots. If you read the product info the fine print says you may not be able to perform typical life activities for 4872 hours.
12420,Shingles vaccine experience: 45 had shingles had both vaccine Shingles is worse
12421,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Had shingles in my early 40s Ill be 50 next month. It absolutely sucks. Still have nerve damage in my back from it. Please get the shot if you can.
12422,Noticed what I thought was a weird rash but once blisters started forming day 4? I went to the ER and was diagnosed with shingles. Prescribed Valacyclovir every 8 hours Prednisone twice a day and Acyclovir ointment every 3 hoursI also take an over the counter anti itch ointment but does not seem to do a whole lot sometimes. Sometimes I take Benadryl. I Am 25 and had the chickenpox vaccine as a child. This popped up a day or two after being fired and losing a friend so I Am sure it was stress induced. Very painful bad time. 010 experience. Trying to get a follow up but my insurance is weird and I keep getting voicemails or appointments weeks out. It hurts and I Am sad.
12424,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I took the shingles COVID and flu shot all at the same time. I was just like Have at me bro I do not remember feeling too bad more than a day so. I was kind of like f it just deal with the pain all at once but maybe they kind of cancelled each other out?
12425,Shingles and other Vaccines: I typically feel a bit under the weather for a couple days but yes it is worth it.
12426,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Got my second Shingrix shot last week so I am done with the routine. Not a single problem from either of them did my regular routine even that afternoon and did not feel bad at all. Plus my insurance completely covered it.
12428,RSV vaccine for infants.: We got it for baby at 2 weeks. She was just very tired that evening and slept hard.

The next 9 years of her life her balance was horrible. She fell a lot.
12437,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: '94 got it and some scars. My younger siblings got the vaccine.
12441,41 and got Shingles: The pain is horrible and its hard to explain to somebody how bad it is because its such a deep seated pain. I Am glad I did not have it on my head. I had it on my torso but I could not wear a bra and any clothing had to be really baggy.
12442,Second Shingles Shot: Who knows just go get it done. I Have had no problems from the shot.
12448,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Oh Christ on a bike. My condolences. So far it is just a patch on my uppertorso. I have read and seen that facial shingles is the absolute worst and I absolutely believe it.
12449,Usually when I get the flu I am bedridden for 46 weeks. Like I cannot sit up or stand up for long periods of time for 46 weeks. The fatigue just crushes me and I am extremely disabled. This has been the case for the past 20 years I get flu about every 4 years and this happens whether I get the flu shot or not. I seem to have a hard time with respiratory viruses generally as I have had a terrible time with covid as well. I got Flu A 2 weeks ago and I found suggested on Earth Clinic website high doses of Lysine an amino acid. I knew Lysine helps with herpes viruses and shingles but I read that it can also help with Flu and Covid. Well it has been nothing short of miraculous. I have been functional the entire time I have had the flu. I mean I Am minorly fatigued and have had headaches chills cough but I have only had to take short naps on 2 of the last 12 days. I found a study on From what I have read it seems you need to be cautious about this if you have kidney or gallbladder issues but if you are normally healthy and take it short term it is safe. I have been taking 2000mg 3x per day. I plan to take this for 3 weeks total and then stop. Also I have avoided arginine foods since those strengthen viruses. I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice just saying what worked for me

12459,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Hope I am not too late but do not combine the shingles one with anything else or it will make you feel like you are dying. Guess how I know this? The worst part for me was my doctor talked me into doing this said it would be fine. It was in fact not fine.
12460,Sounds like some of side effects I had after the shingles vaccine Take care.
12466,shingles???: I Have never been more mad at a piece of information from my doctor than this. Felt like my chicken vaccine was pointless if I was just going to get its evil cousin shingles
12468,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had lesions all over my face from upper lip to my ear. Eating was hugely painful because the affected nerve was also in my mouth. Had eye symptoms for two months in which it was extremely painful to be in bright light uveitis. Flash forward 20 years and that nerve is still numb like having a dental procedure. Any vaccine symptoms are mild compared with this.
12469,I was 34 but I got deathly ill high fever hallucinated that there were spiders on the ceiling so I got my shingles shot last year. Do. Not. Want. Heard its a bitch as an adult. I had my tonsils out in College that was also no fun as a grown up.
12471,Shingles vaccine: I am in the first few days of my 2nd time with shingles I am 36 and I had it 2 years ago. The few days of feeling crummy vs the weeks of feeling like half your body is 500 lbs and dying while you are to foggy and exhausted to think is a no brainer. Get the shot when you have a few days off it will be worth it.
12472,Anyone know anything about getting vaccinated and tzp?: I got Shingles at my last appointment. There should not be an issue and I did not have one. I do inject Zep into my stomach not my arm.
12478,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Oh man A week It seems the second shot can be just as bad. Yikes
12479,The Truth About Shingles Why You Get It And How To Heal It Fast: I allegedly never had chicken pox but got shingles even after having had the old vaccine. Luckily I recognized it immediately raced to my doctor and got the antiviral medication. Apparently I had a subclinical case of chicken pox after all. Know that this happens Big ouchy people very big ouchy. As soon as practicable I got both doses of the newer vaccine. As many other commenters here will tell you shingles is not to be trifled with. Extremely unpleasant and can last for months. I thought I would never shake it off completely but count myself as among the lucky ones.
12480,Shingles vaccine experience: I wish you did not have to be 50 to get the vaccine A 32 yr old coworker just got it and it was HORRIBLE. She said she felt like she had a curling iron on her face. It started on the back of her head and went over the top toward her eye. She also had it in her throat.
12482,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Dear reader I think the point they were making was that any effects from the shot is better than shingles. Do better.
12483,Tell that to my friend. Both his teenage boys got shingles at 14 and 15 years old after getting the chicken pox shot for school.
12484,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Oh wow did NOT know we could request the antiviral ahead of attacks that is sooo helpful thank you so much. The doctor I saw was hesitant to diagnose me with shingles in the first place cus of my age so they really were not helpful at all. Thank you friend
12485,Shingles is the only shot that I have ever felt gave me the shakes that night.
12486,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Had shingles at 37. Was on my torso. Pretty annoying and the nerve tinglies lasted for about 2 weeks after the rash went away.
12487,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Dude I had shingles at a weirdly young age at 25 and it is still the worst pain I Have ever felt. I still would not get the shot though.
12492,Get your shingles vaccine: I got both dose of my shingles series and I did not knowingly have chicken pox when I was younger. One of them was kind of rough the next day if I recall but the peace of mind is priceless. I don t want to get a shingle on my eyeball or in my throat. Lol.
12493,First 24 hours after dose: I get the back side effects to the extent I even get them anymore the next day but the good effects also take at least a day to hit me too.
12494,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox at 22 and it was rough Wish I would been to a pox party as a wain
12496,Put me out of my misery.: I do not really recall discomfort from any of the Shingles vaccines or most vaccines for that matter. I recently got my Tdap and my arm was sore for about 3 days but I did not feel ill.
12497,Vaccines and Humira?: My Rheumatology nurse advised having my last second dose shingles vaccine exactly half way between adalimumab biosimilar doses. The side effects were not fun but definitely better than shingles.
12498,My husband recently went into his PCP's office for a routine visit and to get the covid and flu shots while he was there. There was a mix up. A nurse came in with a syringe and just shot him up with it. He was not asked to confirm his name or date of birth and it was discovered that the shot he was given was a 1st round of Shingles shots. It was a major mistake on the nurse's part But my husband is an easygoing guy and it is his local tribal health clinic where he is on good terms with his doctor so he said it is okay it happened no big deal I will not sue or anything. But then the next time he visited a month later he inquired about well since you already gave me the first round of shingles shots and it is a two part shot can I get the second round? And they told him no he could not. In your opinion if he went back and sort of made a stink about what happened that made him get the first round in the first place would it be more likely the doctors might agree to give him it? Why do you think they are hesitant to do that? Age 47 M 6'0 185lbs white diabetic type 2 controlled and has heart issues but normal ones like stents and stuff. nondrinker nonsmoker no drugs occasionally vape nicotine EDITED TO ASK how should he word his request the next time he goes in. We are not the best communicators
12499,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My daughter got it at 3 days old and I am so happy she did. I am a respiratory therapist and I have worked in a pediatric hospital. Rsv can be scary. I have seen it go very badly in the little ones. Their lungs are so small they cannot handle it and they sometimes end up on a ventilator from it or worse. Since I have been back to work I have had a lot of adults hospitalized with rsv that I have done direct patient care on and baby girl has been doing well. She has had two colds but nothing I am uncomfortable managing at home with lots of saline and suction and humidity.
12502,Shingles and other Vaccines: My mom had shingles and it was horrible. Definitely get a shingles vaccine I AM GOING TO
12503,"Feeling Lost After Vaccine Reactions: I'm a 28-year-old woman who had a similar experience after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Prior to getting vaccinated, I had some minor health issues that seemed to clear up on their own. However, shortly after getting the vaccine, I started experiencing intense fatigue, muscle pain, and a general feeling of unwellness. Like the original poster, I also developed a rash and experienced unusual sensations in my body. Despite multiple trips to the doctor and various tests, no clear answers were found. I was eventually diagnosed with ME/CFS, POTS, and other conditions that have left me feeling completely overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward. I have tried different medications, but like the original poster, I have had adverse reactions to some of them. It's been a challenging journey, and I'm still searching for answers and ways to manage my symptoms. If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for listening."
12504,"""Received the COVID-19 vaccine and now I can't stop laughing uncontrollably! Is this a side effect?"": After getting my COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, I've been experiencing this strange side effect - I can't stop laughing! Everything seems hilarious to me and I'm having a hard time controlling it. Has anyone else had a similar reaction after getting vaccinated?"
12505,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 34 weeker got it at about 37 weeks and was completely fine.
12507,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got it in my 40s. It was painful but I did not have it as severely as some do. I have scars however I had it on my abdomen with a mirror image basically on my back.
12509,"Vaccine dilemma: I recently had the flu shot and then came down with Shingles a week later. Now, I am supposed to get the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow. Although I am still dealing with some migraines in the evening from the Shingles, I am feeling alright otherwise. Should I go ahead with the COVID vaccine tomorrow? I am a 30-year-old female, 5'6'' with no prior diseases and a non-smoker."
12510,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: It is tough when family beliefs impact your health like this it is clear you are dealing with a lot more than just physical pain.
12511,"Tired: I was diagnosed 6 yrs ago with fibro stage 4 now. You all what what a life changer this is for the worse. After getting my shingle shots is when I started flaring off & on with whole body pain. Who knows if this started by the shots. After this, a lot more med & mental probs started I've had severe anxiety my whole life, I'm 58. Since fibro I have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, DDD in neck, back, knees.

I guess my question is I'm still working like 32 hrs a week, but dr.'s suggest go on disability. What are my chances?"
12516,I was vaccinated for Shingles. A couple years later I was diagnosed with shingles inside my head. The pain was indescribable but a steroids drug relieved the pain and other symptoms pretty quick. I was in that slot of 10 Shingrix did not help but it did not because the flare up.
12517,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: My Friday night plan as a single Gen X Shingles vaccine
12522,Shingles Vaccine: I had no reaction whatsoever to the shingles vaccine and it was not a painful injection either. I did however have shingles before I got vaccinated which even a mild case was very unpleasant
12523,Shingrix: I took your advice and told my rheumatologist I needed something as soon as possible She gave me an rx for 2 weeks of prednisone which will get me through the Shingles shot and to the appointment I have to have to get prescribed the Rinvoq. She told me we can go from there so I take that to mean she is open to rxing another short course if needed. I do not know why she is so stingy with the prednisone but at least I got something and I feel better already Thank you again for the empowerment
12524,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles at 36 and it was the worst thing ever. So painful. Get the vaccine if you can.
12528,Good repost. Because of you I got my shingle vaccine It literally killed my fatherinlaw. The pain led to him taking his life.
12539,Stupid me agreed to get both a Pneumo shot and a Shingles vaccine in each deltoid today at my annual.: I have administered these shots hundreds of times and I don't recall anyone mentioning how sore they can make you. I can barely lift either arm.
12540,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Mine did this with me too and I got shingles last summer and it was such a miserable time for me.
12546,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Skull Bearer is incorrect. My daughter has never had chicken pox just the vaccine. She came down with shingles in her left eye during her second year of law school. Be aware the vaccine stops chicken pox you must be vaccinated against shingles separately.
12551,Shingles Vaccine: I have had shingles 3X. First two times were so and ouch inside forearm and spot on ribs felt like a blowtorch when it woke me up at 1 am but Capsaicin HP fixed it 3rd time I burned my last week of vacation that year '21 taking 24003600 mg. of gabapentin my PCP recommended that dosage he was right and hanging over the arm of my recliner listening to podcasts between naps lol. I got the Shingrix series as soon as I was cleared up. 2nd shot a month after the first.
12552,Thought Id share my experience with shingles as a young adult with no prior health concerns. I Am 24F and its been about 3 weeks since I got shingles on my face. The pain has gone away but I still have some of the scars. I scoured the Internet when my symptoms first appeared and could not find a lot of information about other people my age who had gotten shingles so maybe my post can help someone else recognize the symptoms. No one believed my symptoms were shingles due to my age. Days 14 I felt small stings on my face which I thought were bug bites. They were itchy and turned red the next day. It looked like bed bug bites or flea bites. My doctor said it looked like bug bites and sent me home. Pain was a 510. Days 56 The red bumps were appearing more and only appearing on one side of my face. This was the biggest sign as shingles only affects one side of your body. The bumps had started to look like cracked blisters and it felt like searing pain anytime water or even air hit it. I also had a painful blister on my eyelid which felt like constant searing pain. I went back to my doctor he saw the blisters and started me on medicine. Pain was 1010 these days. Days 79 The Lyrica did not help with the pain but did stop more blisters from appearing. Pain was gradually decreasing each day still painful to the touch but the pain was not constant anymore. The blisters were no longer cracked and were healing slowly. Pain had become 410 by day 8. Days 10 and onwards Now I have scars where most of the blisters and bumps used to be. It does not hurt but the scars are still sore and I Am hoping one day will go away. I am thankful the pain has stopped and I am grateful for the support I received from this sub. If you are going through this I hope this post brings you some relief that you will get better
12559,Put me out of my misery.: I tore my cornea so much from rubbing my eye I could see the tear in a makeup mirror. Definitely go to the doctor and get a shingles test. Check your entire body for rash or outbreak. When they finally appeared on my skin they were small dried clusters. Good luck and good health to you I got this case is shingles when I was 30 and another case 20 years later. Also the ophthalmologist asked if I had a yeast infection. Told him no I Have had two before so I knew the symptoms. Made me go to a gyno to get checked. The whole time there I Am thinking my eye is on fire Not my hooha.
12560,Thought I cleared  was wrong: Okay last question would it be possible that I Have gotten reinfected? I had the vaccine 2 years ago. Never had a single outbreak. About a year ago I developed one. Never came back after 8 months. Met her shortly after the 8 months and have had about 67 show up in that time span. She has not had a single one to our knowledge
12563,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I doubt that anyone who loves you would want you to collapse on stage
12566,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: The vaccine is not a big deal. I think the injection site was a little tender for a day or two but that is about it. Shingles can also leave scars. I have a scar on my forehead near my hairline from when I had them. Its not all that noticeable but if I get a sunburn the coloration of that skin is different.
12568,Hi everyone I have had sudden hearing loss in my right ear for 2 weeks. It was mild until 2 days ago and now I suspect it is moderate as of new onset of intermittent stabbing pain and more loss 2 days ago. This was caused by what they think is a viral infection. I went to the er as you do for these things. They gave me T3s and gabapentin. I am on 70mgs of prednisone and have been for almost 2 weeks. Things have gotten worse on them somehow. I am also diabetic so I have been struggling with my insulin but it is sort of in control and I am followed by an endo. The thing is my ent will not see me in person til I get a 2nd hearing test. My audiologist will not see me until the ear pain is dealt with which is ???? but I guess it is a liability. I am talking to my ent tomorrow morning on the phone and the er doctor told me to request an mri of my brain because my ent can expedite it. But how do I deal with the intermittent ear pain? It is stabbing and awful it wakes me up worse than my tinnitus. Even on the T3s it wakes me up. I am also trying to deal with this new loss and tinnitus and do not know if I will get my hearing back. I guess my question is has anyone been in this situation before? How do I express the amount of pain I am in to my ent if she will not even see me in person? I am at a loss ETA my ent thankfully saw me in person and diagnosed me with shingles in my face but it is too late to really try any antivirals she still prescribed them but it is been 2 weeks. I have been prescribed an aggressive pain regime to see if I can stop this from being permanent pain. Hearing loss is likely permanent though 
12569,shingles with no rash: I pray you all are feeling some relief. I have had it for almost 3 months just this week the tiny chicken pock scabby itchy sores developed up n down my spine mostly single sores that itch like cold sores with a few random clusters of sores. It is literally the absolute worst pain I have ever experienced. I have been to dr er and urgent care. So far they thought it was a heart attack pancreatitis ruptured spleen a tear in my abdominal wall hernia and a dozen other things...plus internally I have lipomas that are wrapped around my ribs connected like a spiderweb and swollen that coincided with this. By The Way I have had covid at least 7 times. It feels like tumors everywhere. I thought I was going to lose my mindstill do When we were at my husband's vascular surgeon November 4th Dr. mentioned he is had shingles for 4 months n just finally was diagnosed correctly. Finally a solution and diagnosis omg He wrote a note that I was able to give my dr who then perscribed valtrex and hydro. I literally only sleep about 23 hrs at a time and only then out of sheer exhaustion with the hydrocodone 3 gabapentin cyclobenzaprine to reduce the spasms and alternating ice packs and heating pads. I have a very high pain tolerance and this kicking my butt. I have caladryl lotion a kenalog creamsteroids Salon pas spray and pads lidocaine patches n lotion cbd oil muscle lotion witch Hazel extra strength Excedrin migraine knock off benedryl to help with  the itching and duloxetine.
12572,Ill take that as a no. Just a quick one Russ did you feel ok after your latest booster combined with the flu jab? I was a bit worried about taking it after getting the monkeypox shingles one recently.
12578,Effectiveness of rsv vaccine antibodies during rsv season: my baby just got his own RSV vaccine at his 2m appointment you should ask for it. middle kid was a COVID baby fall 2021 but I happened to participate in a Phase III RSV vaccine trial for pregnant women that was later unblinded so I know we were in the vaccine group rather than placebo. iirc there was an RSV spike that winter. whatever we got seemed to work well for him wishing you best of luck and peace of mind
12579,41 and got Shingles: I have had it twice and I Am 45. I do not know what brought it on the first time but was surprised to learn that it is more common now for younger people to get it. However the second time was very strange. I was making breakfast and a hot piece of sausage popped out of the pan and hit my shoulder. It started itching really bad for a couple days and I broke out all along that nerve in a shingles rash. I was hesitant at first to take my doctors shingles diagnosis but the rash did hurt and follow the same pattern as the first outbreak I had. I did read that infection and injury can prompt reemergence
12582,Shingrix for 50yr olds: THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I AM NOT A DOCTOR I have had recurring shingles since I was 22 38 now and got the shingrix vaccine both doses 3 years ago when I was at a loss and trying anything I could to prevent it from coming back yet again. It did not prevent me from getting shingles again and has made my recurring outbreaks worse. However this is coming from someone who already had shingles not someone who has not ever had shingles so ymmv.
12585,Shingles vaccine: 72 for me. Well the first 18 were okay then it kicked in and ruined my weekend. Thought I was safe getting it on a Thursday night.
12587,Questions about getting vaccinated: What motivates me? Avoiding the flu pnuemonia shingles again and RSV for one thing. I have received multiple shots . It was fine. My husband got 3 in one day was sick after. Dr said he should have only gotten 2 at once. I know a person with polio a woman blind from maternal rubella my husband hospitalized with adult chicken pox an uncle who died of diptheria parental tales of measles whooping cough. That is enough reasons but mostly I am not stupid enough to think I know more that the decades of research.
12589,Shingles at 22?: Not significant pain no. Mostly itching
12590,Hey everyone I Have been in a flare up since thanksgiving and I Am currently on a prednisone taper for it. Last night I stood up and felt a sharp stinging pain in my foot. It literally felt like I had been stung by something and every time I tried to walk Id feel a shooting and stinging pain. I had some gabapentin leftover from when I had shingles and its helping so I Am assuming its nerve pain. Has anyone else experienced anything like this especially during a flare up? I Am supposed to be going to a neurologist but they are so booked up so my appointment is quite a ways away. I Am going to call on Monday to see if I can get in sooner.
12594,Shingles vaccine: My BIL got it in one of his eyes and hes now nearly blind in that eye.
12596,Shingles and influenza: I am 48 and I think I am in the same boat. I definitely have shingles but I am starting to feel mega flu symptoms. NGL pretty nervous at how bad this is about to get
12601,Has anyone had side affects so bad they have had to stop? I went up from the starting dose to the second dose and I am having some serious side effects. Ill be stopping it now because the nauseavomiting and diarrhoea is constantly all day. Such a shame as I did well on ozempic for a while then switched over.
12602,Hello I am a 21 year old female and I get these red dots that form a rash. The red dots will be in my pores on my chest. I keep getting this rash in my cleavage area. It cannot be shingles because I Have never had chickenpox and am vaccinated against it. Anyway the red dots rash sometimes leads to a staph infection that is very painful. I do get eczema but it never looks like this on any other area of my body.
12604,How do you handle infants during flu and RSV season?: Our baby got the shot a few days after birth so about RSV were not too worried but there are many other illnesses during winter season. We do not want her to be sick whatsoever its hard enough with her being healthy. So we frequently wash our hands disinfect our phones and keys and such. When one of us was outside the house we definitely wash our hands and change our clothes before we hold the baby. I mean if its feasible obviously there are situations where we cannot do it like this but mostly we do. Also we do not see family if someone there is sick. As for going out we take walks in the park and around town but do not really go in enclosed spaces with many people. That Is really it.
12606,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got shingles at 35 and it was awful. I am not exaggerating when I say it probably almost killed me and if I was older or a senior it probably would have. When I presented to the emergency room I had a fever of 104 but I was actually feeling better When they clocked me at that. I am still feeling the residual neuralgia almost a decade later.
12609,Shingrix for pharmacists?: Joke is on me and this is a hilariously untimely post. I got eye shingles 2 weeks ago Like literal shingles on my left eyeball. So that is a thing that can happen. Get vaccinated folks
12610,Shingles vaccine experience: The side effects were brutal for me but well worth it to avoid Shingles. I Have heard so many nightmare stories about people getting it in their eyes and have a friend who was bedridden for a year with it.
12611,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My son was born 373 so early term technically but had PPHN so was severely sick  had a 45 day NICU stay. He got Beyfortus around 6 months I think  then got RSV around 8 months old. He was not hospitalized  handled it better than the first time he had the flu the following April. It was super scary for me  I pulled out the Owlet again to keep tabs. He had no side effects at all from the antibody shot its not a vaccine while he had side effects from his earlier shots like Rotavirus. TLDR I think it helped keep him out of the hospital despite catching it in daycare. No side effects seen. I Am 24 weeks pregnant  considering the vaccine I think if I get it I will as late as possible 36w I think
12613,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I had a tiny itchy patch on my chest that I thought was a bite so I put a zit sticker on it so I wouldn t scratch it. Then it got worse so I thought I was having a reaction to the latex. Then it got bigger and I called the doctor who knew what it was. I basically had a sort of wide rash y line under my breast on my right side but it never went beyond that because I started meds right away.
12619,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I have had shingles twice. Yes I had the single shot vaccine a year before I had shingles the first time. Later I was told to get the two shot vaccine which I did. I had shingles again about a year or maybe more after that two shot vaccine. Both time the cases were mild. Let me repeat MILD. The first bout of shingles presented as 17 lesions and the second was 4. My kids were vaccine against the chicken pox they will never have shingles. Good.
12620,Hi everyone I had shingles in the hospital in March and am suffering from some PHN in my T4 dermatome upper right quadrant of my back and in my right armpit area. I am currently on pregabalin Lyrica which is doing some good in reducing the pain but it is still annoying. I have been wondering whether getting a shingles vaccination now would have any effect good or bad on the PHN. I know that people who have had shingles are advised to get the shots because they can get shingles again but despite a lot of online research I have seen nothing about the shingles vaccine and PHN. Does anyone know anything about this?
12621,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: you hear the few laughs as she fell? some people thought it was a skit lmao.
12622,Maternal RSV Vaccine Too Close to Delivery?: I got the RSV vaccine last fall at 35 weeks and had me baby at 35w6d after PPROM. Because it had been less than a week the baby was able to also get the antibodies in the hospital as the doctor said the turnaround was too quick for her to have gotten any benefit from the vaccine She is 6.5 months now and just had her first coldfever last week after seeing lots of family in JanFeb March. I also did not get sick at all this weekend. It was totally worth it
12624,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Hi I am still in pain althought it had gotten better a little bit. What is killing me now is the itch. Thank you for asking
12625,"Shingles Vaccine & Tinnitus / HELP?: Do you want to know what can make tinnitus worse? Google ""Herpes Zoster Oticus."" A friend of mine has this. I've had shingles, too. Thank goodness it wasn't on my face putting my eyes, mouth, or ears at risk but trunk of my body. Risks with vaccination? Small ones, yes, as is the case with all vaccines. I'd take the vaccine rather than shingles any day."
12628,A Week In My Life Vlog 407: Oh dear I Am getting my first shingles vaccine tomorrow. My husband had bad side effects with his. I had shingles last summer and it lasted about 6 months. Not fun The doctor said I still need to get the shot. Hope its not too bad.
12630,Shingles vaccine: I was worried too. Got the shot earlier this year waited 90 days for the second shot and then did that one too. Both times? Nada. Zilch. Sore arm. Nothing else. The first shot is just introducing your body to the virus so it can build the proper response when it sees the virus again. The SECOND shot is where your body goes HOLYCRAP I KNOW THIS THING KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT WITH FIRE and therefore you feel sick after it. But I dodged it. Seems about 5050 amongst my friends. Half of them had a terrible second shot half of them had no issues.
12633,Cimetidine 1000mgday Shingrix vaccination would induce a larger immune response. The first dose of Shingrix with or without cimetidine does not feel good eg. CGRP. The second dose of Shingrix is when I noticed a positive change.
12635,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You cannot get shingles if you have not had chicken pox.
12636,"Postherpetic Neuralgia: Try acupuncture, I'm on my 8th week and got shingles in the genital area butt cheek upper thigh. Pain goes down my left leg. Since doing the acupuncture I've been able to reduce my dose of my Lyrica and stopped taking hydro morphone. Still pretty numb in genital area and gotta see where can do acupuncture to try around there ????"
12643,FTM due in January 2025. My OB has recommended I get the RSV vaccine specifically Abrysvo. I am all for getting any vaccines that will protect me and my baby but I have some concerns about this as its only been around for a short time and looking for expert advice context why I ask I unfortunately got pericarditis in December 2021 from getting an mRNA Moderna COVID booster and I have been a bit cautious of what I get since that experience. I Have luckily recovered from that quickly Ill add but my worry is having this happen again with a newer vaccine and in my third trimester while you are limited in what treatments you cancannot have. What kind of vaccine is Abrysvo? Have there been any reported cases of pericarditis from this vaccine?
12644,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Felt like someone hit my arm with a hammer for days
12645,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I am scheduled for my first shot next week. I watched my wife's uncle go through it while he also was dealing with another health issue. It prevented him getting treatment for the second issue and indirectly contributed to his death."
12648,SAME I got to stay awake. Got the pneumonia vaccine yesterday dauuum it is almost as bad as the 2nd shingles shot. Aspirin helps a lot though
12652,I was diagnosed with unspecified inflammatory arthritis a few weeks ago. It is unspecified because apparently my blood work does not check all the RA boxes but my symptoms do so my rheumatologist is treating it like RA. This is in addition to having ulcerative colitis which I Have had for many years. Apparently the best biologic on the market to treat both conditions is Rinvoq which requires me to get the Shingrix vaccines. My concern is that I Am in a full blown untreated flare. I am on Stelara for my UC and started plaquenil a few weeks ago but its doing nothing yet and my rheum does not want to put me on steroids understandable. I am in so much pain. My fingers look like sausages and I cannot grip anything for the life of me. Even driving and turning the steering wheel is hard. My arm tissues or tendons? I do not know.. hurt and the tendons around my knees do too. Needless to say I am miserable. Will Shingrix make all this worse?? I honestly do not see this pain subsiding anytime soon its been 2 months of testing before they finally figured out it might be RA and zero has changed.
12654,Shingles Is NO Joke: May I ask do you have any nervous system issues with it? The Dmards that I Have tried made me so depressed and anxious. Arava made me feel suicidal.
12657,Dermatologist Explains Shingles Is it Contagious? Shingles Treatments  Prevention?  Dr. Sam Ellis: Beware if your doctor does a swab and sends it for lab testing. Mine did and I found out later it was some kind of experimental test not covered by insurance. This was not my usual GP and the 400 I had to pay for that lab was an expensive mistake. My actual GP later told me that shingles is typically just a visual diagnosis and she would not have ordered that lab. I did get shingles several months after the shingrix vaccine. The pain and rash was GREATLY reduced. My rash did not even weep any fluid. Get that vaccine
12658,My sister had shingles which affected her optic nerve almost went blind. As a nurse I know the shingles vaccine can be rough for certain people but usually does not last long is certainly better than losing sight or have chronic PHN.
12659,Shingles vaccine: Amen. Got it in December and am technically still recovering much better though. My eye is slightly permanently fucked up but it could be much worse e.g. blind in that eye. I missed 5 weeks of work working as much as I could at home. I am only 44 and am planning to ask my doctor at my next physical to be vaccinated. If she says no my plan is to cry until she relents. I do not care that insurance will not cover it. We have paid out 4500 so far in medical bills for this illness and the costs will continue as I will have to continue to see an eye doctor for this and may be on a steroid eye drop for years to keep from having flare ups of inflammation.
12663,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Never went to a party but did hear about them but I got shingles at 25 years old and again this year at 36. At 25 it was one of the most excruciatingly painful experiences of my life. It was on the back of my head and my lymph nodes in my neck swelled to the size of a golf ball. I had issues for months the first time. It wreaked havoc on my entire body.
12664,"Immigrant Medical Exam.: I submitted my RFE for I-693 a week ago. I got another RFE stating that the vaccination record was incomplete. I had done it last summer so, Covid-19 vaccine and Hepatitis B were not required. I however took the other required shots. I called the clinic where I went for the examination and they said they think it's because I just got one dose of Varicella. Do you think this makes sense? Or they probably omitted something else? I'm planning on redoing the examination and now that we have an updated form with different instructions, I'm confused whether I should get all the doses for Hepatitis B or just one will be okay? Should i get the second one for Varicella? And I of course will get the flu shot since it's that season. Kindly advice. Thanks ??"
12669,Shingles and other Vaccines: The 2nd shingles shot was very uncomfortable yet compared to the misery of shingles its worth it
12672,Shingles?: Day 8 after the bumps on my neck appeared. There were 5 now there are 6.
12673,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: A friend's husband got the shingles and did not get vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated. Said it was horrible worse than anything he had before. I have the vaccine first round hurt like he will for about 24 hours round 2 not so bad. Totally worth it.
12684,i got shingles in december january but didn t seek treatment right away as i have been vaccinated never had chicken pox as a kid. news flash it was shingles anyway. from my understanding this shouldn t be possible right? the doctor who diagnosed me said that in very rare cases the vaccine can reactivate under unexplained conditions she noted extreme stress and because shingles. i m still not sure how that work but it was definitely shingles. i still have n europa thy in my left ankle and occasional radiating pain in my hip. neither of my parents recalled myself or any of my siblings very close in age they definitely would have caught it too ever having chicken pox either. anyone else have a similar unexplainable experience?
12686,The same thing happened to me with the shingles vaccine Odd.
12687,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I had shingles in my scalp forehead and eye. Your doctor should send you to ophthalmologist. It caused increased pressure in my eye and I had to use 3 different kinds of drops for almost a year.
12691,"Feeling frustrated after my fourth encounter with shingles post-vaccination with the Zostavax vaccine. Could my lupus medication, Plaquenil, be contributing to these relentless outbreaks? Any lupus warriors experiencing shingles flares due to immunosuppressants? And the location of this latest outbreak is unexpected - typically on my face, but this time it's on my neck near the hairline. Anyone else battling shingles relocating to different areas? Taking antivirals again to try and contain the outbreak before it worsens ?? #shinglesbattle"
12693,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the flu on the train after attending the last PAX South gaming convention back in 2019. That was a very slow ride back home from hell. I have got it every year since..
12694,41 and got Shingles: I have had it twice once in 2001 and again in 2022. The second time was MUCH worse but i powered through it because the rash did not show until i was in key west with my boyz for a little RR. there was no rnr there though. instead i was on the antivirals shrugging my shoulders so the rash would not hurt and trying to hide the rash from my friends. i had to tell them though and they sort of understood. so embarrassing. My wife got it last year and she said it was awful for her. she tried to get the vaccine but we are both under 50 and no one would bend on the age restriction for the vaccine. xennials should have our own medical lobby.
12698,Postshingles neuropathy on my face is driving me insane 36: Luckily not my mouth. All on my cheek mostly feel the pain at my ear and temple and radiating sensitivity from my chin to my scalp
12703,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got the series recently and agree that the side effects were nasty. I also saw my husband go through it at 40 way earlier than he could take the vaccine. I definitely did not want that experience myself if I could avoid it.
12704,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: It originally felt like a muscle pain in my front uppertorso with no rash on the Monday 1202. I was Googling around for oblique strain thinking that is what it was. Wednesday night 1204 I looked in the mirror with a small patch of rashes in the same area below pectoral uppertorso and with a few sensitive spots around to the upperlat of the same side. After Dr. Googling it totally booked a sesh with the doc's for the next day and scored me the antivirals. Some peeps on here are saying to get the shingles vaccine beforehand. I totally did not know that was a thing otherwise I would have grabbed that at my last annual checkup in a heartbeat.
12705,Hi all I started Humira this year for pan colitis. Things are slowly improving but I have found I manage to develop or catch literally everything. I know the whole point is it is lowering my immune system but come on I live alone and work from home I do not really socialise much. So my body has decided it will develop infections like toenails random rashes cuts that do not heal for ages constant sore throat etc. I even got bloody shingles randomly. I have never felt so immunocompromised. It is awful my poor gp is probably getting bored of me Any tips from people on long term biologics? I wash my hands properly to the point they dry out I wear a mask outside the house and use alcohol wipes on my phone.
12709,I got shingles form last week and in 1st photo they are become dry but i am still itchy in other place like chest and arm and still appeared folliculitis like in 2nd photo in my chest .it is normal to keep getting new shingles even old shingles are dry?: I Am wondering if that is what I have ?? X day 3 and it hurts around it but not itchy or spreading
12710,First diagnosed in July 2023 got the medication after 34 days and the rash and sores lasted for about 4 weeks. They healed but left a large scar in front of my eyebrow where the first blister appeared I Am 33yo female with no underlying illness that I know of. About every 3 months it would come back in the same spot where the scar is located . I get on the medication right away and only experience one or two blisters which disappear after a couple days. In September 2024 it came back and did the usual but about 4 weeks later it popped up again which it never had that close before. In October I was put on a daily dose of Valtrex and since then its come back nearly every 7 days I Have taken time off work to recover totally changed my diet and started taking lysine. So far GP and dermatologist told me to keep taking Valtrex and I cannot be vaccinated until I Am a year clear of this. I Am currently having an outbreak again in the original spot but today I found another blister inside my eyelid despite taking Valtrex it was only ever on the outside of my eye and never spread that far before. Has anyone experienced this and have any advice? Its starting to feel absolutely hopeless and affecting my work and life with it coming back weekly since October 2024.
12711,I had mine with pneumonia nurse told me Id be fine ill for a week although it was not as bad as actual shingles and dose 2 was ok.
12715,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Yay this makes me so happy to read If I can help prevent one person from experiencing the horrid pain I went through by talking about it that is worth it. Hope your reaction to the shot is mild and that you never get shingles
12717,Ear symptoms several years after shingles in ear?: Yes I Am experiencing the same after my first breakout 3years ago any progress after seeing the ent?
12720,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I was diagnosed with shingles 3.5 weeks ago and the rash has basically cleared up but I have been left with the most intense itching. I contacted an NP online and she did diagnose me with PHN. When I look it up it does say that PHN is when it lasts longer than 3 months. She said I could take antihistamines for it which did nothing and gave me a topical steroid cream which seemed to make it worse. Basically i do not know if she even knew what she was talking about but she did tell me if it did not let up and those things did not make it better I could have to have an in person consultation with someone.
12721,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Good thing she was vaccine or she would fall even harder.
12722,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I just received my 2nd dose of the shingles vaccine and all I experienced was soreness from the injection. I did not have any noticeable flu or cold like symptoms that they say are common. Get the vaccine if you are able having shingles is way worse then the common side affects of the vaccine unless you are allergic.
12727,Shingles vaccine: Same. I just had a sore arm for a day. And I have found that if I go to the gym and purposely use that arm or do some yoga the soreness is gone the next day.
12728,Shingles vaccine: I got sick af from both of them as did my partner. Its to be expected but way worth it.
12731,First bout of shingles at 56: Sorry to hear of your pain. I am 63 and have my first and hopefully last case. I am on about day 10 and the rash is starting to dry up but still there. The nerve pain is worse somedays are better than others especially at night. I hope you got to the dr and got antivirals if not please go as soon as possible. Do not hope it just gets better. The sooner you start antivirals the best the chance it will not get worse. I did get one shot of the vaccine a year ago and did not go back for the second shot. I dropped the ball on that and so sorry now. Even with one shot this has been wicked horrible and I expect it might have been worse without it. Best of luck to you.
12734,pneumococcal vaccine safe for us?: yes i had it 1 year ago. As with all vaccinations it has the potential to evoke an immune system response which can because a flare. i have only had a reaction with shingrex all others i have never had an MG response. always avoid live attenuated vaccines.
12741,Was this really a thing?: Had pox once as a child and again in a mild form as an adult. I have had Shingles too. It was not like what I expected at all thankfully. I had a blood infection when it reared it is ugly head. It felt like this awful itch coming from inside me. I kept asking my husband to look because it felt like some bug was burrowing out of me. Nope just Shingles. Thankfully mine was not horribly painful but my husband's was. His showed up after a bee sting. Its so crazy we cannot get the shot because we are not 50. They really should change the age
12742,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I Am 26 just got the shingles vaccine because you need to when starting Rinvoq. It was not bad the shot hurt more than the flu shot for instance like injectionwise likely because of the administrator though but otherwise was fine. I know it seems scary since were very young but much better than the alternative of getting shingles
12743,Shingles vaccine: Sore arm and great sleep. No biggie. I have 3 friends who got it at ages 506080ish. Terrible suffering. One got it in her eye and is permanently impaired. That is when I got it. Very scary.
12746,Shingles vaccine experience: Get the shingles vaccine. You will feel slightly pukey for a day or two after the second dose but so much better than getting shingles. Everyone aged 50s or older.. go. Go now. Get your vaccine. You can walk right in to most pharmacies and get it. Seriously. Now. Or in the morning. Go.

12763,when did you first notice a difference?: Most times I do my shot in the morning and by dinner time I am feeling it. So 46 hours on average. I felt it with the low doses and still do at 7.5.
12770,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If you are in the US you can make an appointment to get the vaccine on the CVS app. I may have just checked a box that said I Am immunocompromised but I do not remember. Lol I Am old and overweight though so like technically that counts. They gave me the shot and my insurance paid for it. No one asked any questions. I was 35 at the time.
12771,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom ran a daycare in our home starting in the mid 80s and one kid got chicken pox and everyone else brought their kids over to suffer through as well. Fast forward 30 years and I got shingles at 34 years old all over my face eyes and scalp. It was the worst thing to go through and I would not wish that on the worst enemy I still have a gnarly scar on my forehead I swear it felt like my skin was melting off my face
12772,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Jimmy Dore had similar reactions. especially the neck pain part.
12774,"Side effects from Vaccine: Hi, just reading some of the posts here and I'm experiencing similar issues. I was vaccinated in April 2021 (AstraZeneca) and 2nd dose (Phizer) thanks Canadian government! I had vertigo, then was told I had shingles. I have had constant burning, tingling, numbness in my head, dizziness, no appetite, depression/anxiety. I cannot go out in the wind because when I come inside it feels like my head is on fire. If I wear a hat, when I take it off, still feels like the hat is on my head. I cannot go for a ride in a vehicle because when I get out, the activity in my head increases (tingling, electricity). I also have a weird sensation in my arm, feels like spasms. Almost like my brain needs a couple seconds to catch up to the movement (like delayed, can't explain). As of today, I've been given 12 different kinds of meds, been to ER 7 times (which does not include my dr's office). I've seen a neurologist, CATscan, MRI, blood work, etc. This started in April and today is Oct 14 and I'm still having issues, not as bad but I can't work and have been put off on medical leave for over a month now. I'm devastated because I feel like I've lost my life. Its passing by and I'm in so much pain and discomfort. Has anybody out there been cured of this. I'm crying as I type this because I'm so frustrated and the drs think I'm nuts. As if I'm making this up, or that its just anxiety. None will say that this could be linked to vaccination. Can someone out there who's been there reassure me that this is not how my life will be forever. If you had this issue and are now ok, can you share with me what worked. What type of tests I may be missing, what supplements I should take? I feel lost and can't take to much more of this. I have enough poison in my body now from antidepressants to pain killers to ativan. Please any suggestions would be so much appreciated. Thanks for reading."
12775,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was almost sent to a chicken pox party when I was around 12 but I was due to be in a play relatively close to that so my mom decided not to send me incase I did not get better in time. Then it never came up again. Thank god. I moved out when I was 17 and finally got all my vaccines like ALL my mom is vaccine at 18.

Despite these temporary discomforts, I'm grateful to have taken this step towards immunity and safety."
12781,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I got chicken pox and was vaccinated after. Still got shingles at 31.
12785,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I caught chicken pox as a kid but not through any nefarious means like that just standard kindergarten exposure. My first round of Covid left me with long Covid and a severely diminished immune system and I subsequently had shingles. I was extremely lucky my partner recognised a small pattern of red lines to the side of my spine as most likely shingles and later that day before they even had spread or blistered I was on antiviral medication. Hardly anyone is lucky enough to begin treatment that rapidly. Even then shingles is the most intensely sick I have even been in my life. I was rugged up in an Oodie with two duvets over me and a heat pack and I was violently shivering. Like if you have ever seen video of an alcoholic undergoing extreme withdrawals it was like that. So do all that stuff your mum tells you to do ok? Rug up rest up take your meds and vitamins eat healthy... You are in for a bad time. Best of luck.
12788,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: At the 3 week mark I was finally able to wear underwear it was still uncomfortable. Week 4 I was feeling much better. I had it really bad all left side from the top of my vagina all the way back to the top of my butt. Had to go to the ER twice because the pain was so bad that my blood pressure was at stroke level. I still have nerve pain 3 months later it starts in the center of my upper left leg and shoots down to my foot. I Am able to manage that pain with Gabapentin. Ill pray for a swift recovery for you
12789,So I was diagnosed two years ago with HSV 2 and never had an out break past the first one which I remember being really bad. However I am 7.5 months pregnant and experiencing my second outbreak. I was on 500 mg and then switched to 1 gram for the last year as a preventative each day. I want to die the pain is so bad its been a week and I Have been taking 2 grams a day to get rid of it and it is so slow to heal. It started on the original side and then immediately the right side so its almost like I Am having a double outbreak. Any ideas why this is so harsh now? You would think I have more immunities. The only thing that could maybe have triggered it was I got a RSV vaccine? Anyone have insight? I Am scared now that I will continue having them and will need a C Section its been too long years but I feel as low as when I first found out
12790,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: We knew a childminder who knowingly sent a child with chickenpox to a party. With our 2 year old Daughter who had very severe eczema which she knew about. We knew nothing. Daughter ended up in hospital due to fever seizures and had the worst case of chicken pox I have known of. Child minder spouted this nonsense about it being good to get it young. She also claimed my partner would teach your daughter your dyslexic ways. I fucking marched to that bitches house and told her exactly what I thought of her. Apparently being a child minder means you are an expert on infectious diseases and educational psychology s.
12791,Small red bumps: Is it itchy and hurts to scratch? Could be shingles I got it when I started dupixent as the double loading dose was too harsh on my immune system
12796,Get your shingles vaccine: I asked my neuro if I could pau s the Ty s a bri infusions for 23 months to get the chickenpox vaccine and was told that it is not a very good idea due to rebound. Got a note from my neuro that she authorized me getting it and had the shingles vaccine yesterday. Today I woke up and felt like I have been run over by a truck. My head hurts my arm feels like it weights a 100 kg having a slight fever of 38 C and just feeling like crap. I have not had chickenpox but reading your experiences of it is definitely worth the 250 it cost here in Sweden. In case I do get chickenpox I hopefully will not get shingles after that. And my neuro said there is a possibility that the vaccine can give a slim protection against chickenpox as well.
12799,Have I got a case for you: NAD but also a ND who has had some similar issues come up since my second pregnancy. Recurring shingles stood out to me as a possible autoimmune disorder beyond celiac I mean. A LOT of autoimmune disorders are more common in ND people. There may also be a correlation with the vitamin d deficiency based on a preliminary google search. Only adding my thoughts in hopes of helping since it sounds like that route has not been explored yet or mentioned in other comments. For me the path pointed to MCAS. I can definitely empathize on the struggle to get in front of a doctor who will listen though.
12803,Its miserable Same for me. The 2 shingles shot was even worse
12808,That is awesome. Last time I got shingles flu and covid together and that was... a lot. I do not think I do that again lol. But covid and flu vaccine I can handle at the same time. Still lays me out though
12813,So I am one of the many whonend up getting the beaten up jumped by 5 men or run over by a bus' side effect when I so my shot. I had rashes from Ozempire and in places that ...well... you do not want burning itching and hives lol as well as on my neck and thighs. I also had horrible flu like tired feeling on it. I switched to zep and every time I take it  the first 2 days I get the muscles aching so bad I cannot move  the skin sub burn feeling does not happen oddly on the scalp  but all over my body and the bone ache in my legs that goes to knee joint pain that goes away to heel of both feet pain before bed then they all dissappear and I jist get tired and a flu feeling. It kind of seems like this is jitti f our Neuromuscular system. I had an injury which caused dystonia and I def do not want a ither neuromuscular disease I see NM diseases all the time in my weekly life and I am TERRIFIED OF THEM. HOW SURE are we that this is not DAMAGING us long term? if we get this if people off the compounds get this and yet NEITHER list these as a side effect when thousands on reddit alone are getting this exact side effect from brand and compounds? I do not want to seem like a deb je downer but Neuromuscular diseases are a living hell i do not want to end up getting smacked with that has been caused by a drug I took. A lot of people are saying it is the immune system working. It is attacking what it does not want Well then are the 34 of other people who do not get this have a BAD immune system thst does not work? It cannot be that. If it is our immune system working then that is saying 14 of everyone taking glp1 do not get it that bad because they do not have a working immune system. I do not think only 14 of us have a good immune system. I know i do not wither way lol. Everyone else says it is just a side effect. Ok but it IS a pretty bad side effect... and if 14 of us are getting it  should not the company be explaining what and why and if staying on it is going to possibly give us a Neuromuscular disease. Or gof forbid give us crps  the skin pain disease And then a lot of people have said it actually is shingles that it is hitting. And many if us under 50 are not immune to shingles so I think it is imports how many people broke out in shingles after this side effect. I am terrified and panick over shingles. Dr say it is not a listed side effect but if it goes away it is ok. Some dr know its a side effect and are not trying to find out what it is. Some people say it was only their 1sr shot or when switching over like I did. Other say it each time they up dose others say it is every week for two days. A few are saying it is never gone away  even when going off the drug. THAT concerns me and i think this should be concerning to everyone as these are new shots. Why has not the company listed this complaint on side effects yet? I feel even more anxiety as ao many are having it yet they are not listing it in any glp1?
12816,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Totally agree with everyone here condeming the stupidity horrible danger of locking a sick child in a freezing car But another important issue needs to be addressed I will be 70 Dec 5th. The granmother is only 56. With the current medical knowledge there is no sane reason the grandmother should have bypassed the vaccine schedule as prescribed by the biological mother's pediatrician for this child. Mostlikey the baby had an even more severe reaction due to it overlapping the doctor just administering the measles vaccine. Purposely infecting with chickenpox was popular back in the 50's when my mother did it to both of us at same time my sister 3.5 yrs younger as a toddler me at 5. Yes I still have small little dimple scars. But more importantly due to the extreme stress caused by my 7 yrs younger brother drunkenly relentlessly verbally abusing me daily for hours for 2 weeks on all forms of media his 2 wks Christmas vacation I got a severe case of shingles Dec of '21 the horrible rash lasting 5 months. I was not able to make the 6 hour round trip to place Christmas wreaths on our parents' graves. Dad passed 122720 almost 96 mom 5921 Mother's Day at 94. I moved in to care for them 672019. At 50 I was a powerlifter. But I now still suffer muscle damage from shingles. The current chickenpox vac also prevents shingles. My worries are that now this child may also have the pain I had still suffer with. I sincerely pray she does not.
12817,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I was diagnosed with Shingles in October it still hurts my face and head. Suck it up and get the shot it will not be that bad. In comparison.

12821,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: Gave me a seizure and could not drive but no genital warts at least. But in all reality minus the seizure I probably would not do it again. They put the fear in me to get it in my 20s.
12822,Getting RSV shot during pregnancy? Triple check they give you the right one.: This has been happening with Covid vaccines recently. I Am seeing so many reports of it especially at chain pharmacies like CVS Walgreens etc. I just got vaccine last week and I double and TRIPLE checked to make sure they were giving me vaccine I made my husband do the same. I have no problem with Moderna and Pfizer I Have had both in the past. But vaccine offers better protection with reduced side effects and that is what I wanted. And anecdotally some people report that it helps with LC symptoms which I have LC so I Am hoping I get some relief from vaccine But I say that to say this negligence is actually malpractice and you can report whoever is responsible for this.
12826,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Thank you The shot itself was not at all bad no worse than a flu shot. I always ask the person giving the shot to tell me something about their life to take my mind off of what is happening. So TIL that Sikh people would like to have their own nation and that Sikh people are known for bravery and they fought in WWI and WWII on behalf of the British but then experienced a genocide of 4 million people. I might have some of these details wrong I was getting a shot and the person was mask and English was not their first language but anyway Was interesting to learn. we will see how sore my arm gets. That is so interesting that you do not need the shingles vaccine good for you
12829,I am a 65 yo male about 3 months out from a shingles outbreak on the left side of my face inner ear mouth lips cheek. I have had post her pet ic neuralgia ever since numbness tingling itchiness insomnia headaches. I really do not want to have to experience that again. However I am suspicious of most vaccine vaccines. I never took the C covid shots due to the unknown mRNA technology and the manufacture of spike proteins. My doctor tells me Shin gri x is not mRNA though that does not mean it is free of spike proteins. I read about severe reactions to the Shin gri x vaccine I read about shingles reoccurring post vaccine But the selling point is it is 90 percent effective at stopping Shingles. I am debating whether or not to take the shot. too much is shrouded in secrecy to take that gamble. there is a little info on the FDA page I cannot find any information about how it is supposed to work in the human body Shin gri x a vaccine for the prevention of shingles in adults 50 years of age and older includes AS 01 B. AS 01 B is made of up MPL a purified fat like substance and QS 21 which is purified from the bark of the Quillaja saponaria soap bark evergreen tree native to central Chile.
12834,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: My friend got shingles ON her 50th birthday. Ended up having permanent paralysis in one side of her face. I got that shingles shot the second I could after that. Do Not mess around with it. Get your shots
12836,"I got the shingles vaccine two days ago and I have a terrible headache, is that why?: just wondering if the side effects show up two days later, I felt like road kill yesterday, fever body aches, and now today horrible headache...? still better than shingles though, not complaining, just wondering, thank you"
12837,Getting two vaccines at once: One vaccine will do this and leave me down for days. So I have never tried to double up on them. Need a chicken pox vaccine and dragging my feet.
12839,Shingles vaccine: It is worth it to get the shot. Getting shingles is MISERABLE. My SIL got internal shingles and she said it was the worst pain she has ever felt. This is a woman who gave birth to twins If you are worried about the recovery time get the shot on a Friday where you do not have to do anything all weekend.
12840,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I waited a couple days before going to the doctor the first time. Thought it was just a rash. By then it spread all over my chest well one side of course and under my armpit around to my back. I went to my gf's doctor since I had not found one yet and she gave me the DRIVE DIRECTLY TO THE PHARMACY WAIT FOR THEM TO FILL THIS TAKE 2 IMMEDIATELY AND ONE MORE BEFORE BED The nerve damage was the worst part though. I have got my first and only keloid from that first bubble that popped too lol
12843,I am so tired of shingles.: I am 36 years old and having shingles after shingles. In JanuaryFebruary I have had a rare case of shingles without any rash. I had hyperesthesis under my left arm and then around my pelvis and then under my right arm. It came back after stopping Acyclovir... The doctors were surprised that it moves live this. I am now taking a 1year treatment of Valacyclovir 500mg 1 per day but it looks like I have a new hyperesthesis since this morning around my hip. I am extremely worried is there anything I can do to fight better against it ??
12844,Shingles vaccine: Sore arm each time. No big deal and sooooo much better than shingles outbreaks.
12854,My son is 9 weeks old and just got his vaccines and RSV antibodies I Am supposed to travel to my family for Christmas. The travel alone is stressing me out a 4.5 hour car ride but the idea of him being about family who has been on airplanes and getting him sick has me so panicked. On the other hand I feel so much guilt about them not seeing him for Christmas. I do not know what to do.
12855,I react to every vaccine so I stupidly decided to get my first shingles shot with one of my COVID shots. I thought if I had be down I might as well be down once. NO Grave mistake. So bad. I hope you are feeling better very soon.
12856,Long Term Side Effects from Shingrix vaccination. Chronic ear pain dizzyness vertigo.: Can you describe your inflammatory response. What are the symptoms. Thanks.
12857,Shingles vaccine experience: I might add that leading up to having my own stem cells harvested for later transplant after chemo it was advised I take a course of oral shingle medication in pill form. Post chemo and stem cell transplant my immune system was back to that of a newborn baby which is why I needed to start over with all my vaccinations.
12858,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Yeah I wish I could get that vaccine I am so scared of shingles confoundedface My colleague got it on her face a few years ago. that is when I learned that if it gets to your eye you can go BLIND Another friend got it on her scalp and she was having migraines for days on end. They finally figured it out after ruining a bunch of tests including an MRI. I hope you recovered ok.
12860,Hi all my condolences to all of you who are experiencing the nastiness of shingles. I had it in October of 2022 as a special 50th b'day gift. My doctor told me to wait a year to get the vaccine. Well I have not gotten around to it yet and about 2 days ago I got a little red bump in my eyebrow exactly where the shingles was and I do not think it is a pimple. Beyond that a few of my lymph glands are swollen but just mildly. My question is should I get the vaccine right now to help me build antibodies? My symptoms really are so mild I do not think a doctor would feel comfortable diagnosing it yet.
12861,Hello all This is about my 5 this h post on my progression with BP. You can find the other parts to my story linked below Just Developed for the 1st Time One Week In Rant. Center for Facial Recovery Georgetown O to la ry ng ology Yesterday was my 3rd session at the Center for Facial Recovery in Rockville MD and I was seen by another specialist who was the cofounder of the center. Her 20 years experience in the field of treating just Bell's was immediately apparent by the way she explained concepts on recovery and rehab to me in a way I had not heard yet. My GF a PT with her own vast experience in the lower extremities came with and was blown away by the experience and kno weld ge of this woman. She did say that I am recovering well that small controlled movements and not forcing expressions is key and that slow movements are how you retrain the brain to make facial expressions again. do not chew a bunch of gum do 10 reps of a slow smile a snarl eyebrow raise then rest. Repeat the next day. Allowing the face to naturally relearn how to move is much more important as you are retraining your face and brain connections to make expressions. She also mentioned that syn ken is a given there is no way to prevent that from happening other than to not a gg riva te it in the first place by using something like electro s tim. The face is creating new pathways and will connect nerves as it sees fit. it is the duty of the rehab to make sure those pathways are ingrained in the right direction. it is also the duty of the rehab to break up any stiffness and fa sci al tissue that could be preventing the movement of the face. This is where a professional is really necessary. I have had essentially deep tissue massages before to work on my ankle mobility via my GF. This is what she specializes in mobility of the ankle foot joint and bone complex work on ambulatory therapies so that children can walk without pain or improving their neuro logia cal fun c it on in their lower extremities. she is work on me before and it. fucking. hurt. Now I need the same therapies for my face. When your face is paralysed the f as cia and the tissues become rig gid which needs manual release so that the weaker muscles on the affected side can then move freely. This does not happen without getting some uncomfortable treatments pulling stretching deep pressure massages dry needling the work. Her fingers were in my mouth and down my throat at one point. I say all that to say this do not just go to your neighborhood masseuse go to an experienced PT that knows the face to get all that released. Also work on your neck posture so actually maybe do make that massage appointment. Most of the muscles of the face attach to basically the back of your neck and wrap around your skull so if you have a tight neck that can because some issues. The relationship between Zoster s sine He pete and Bell's Palsy in relation to my own condition was also more thro uro gh ly explained in my last PT session. Basically at this point this is a Herpes Zoster s flair up and not Bell's. Think of Bell's as a chest cold Zoster s is the virus and at this point the cold has turned into pneumonia. So what could have been a quick recovery is now a situation that requires long term meds and rehab of neurological pathways. Zoster s is like the umbrella term that includes conditions like Bell's Ramsay Hunt's Syndrome Chickenpox and Shingles which are all and I am sorry for the stigma a type of herpes flair up that either only attacks the nerve directly Bell's Shingles attack the nerve and presents on the skin Ramsay Hunt's Shingles or only presents on the skin Chickenpox. For me the flair up is only on the nerve so it is Zoster s sine Her pete which is seen as a more atypical clinical manifestation of Herpes Zoster but I would be smart about getting the Shingles vaccine in the future since I more than li k ley am prone to it and I do not want it developing into the classic kind. So yes at the first sign of any unusual activity in the face please go to the ER and get on a steroid IMMEDIATELY. I belie I have the longevity of my condition going since May was due largely in part to a misdiagnosis of the severity of my condition. It was not until I saw a neurologist that I was re com mede d for an MRI s can. That s can is scheduled for September so I will be returning with those results once I get them. I am also on a Prednisone taper Ni podi pine for 30 days and 6 months of Va lacy clo vi r 3 x a day just to make sure this flair up is no more. x 200 B If you are of a certain age get the Shingles vaccine There is a direct correlation between these kinds of flair ups and C covid vaccine which is nothing new when you consider immuno comp or mise d individuals live with these risks all the time. it is just that a larger population of us US citizens specifically already have Zoster s in us whether it is through Chickenpox contraction or vaccination. So any hit to the immune system can because a flair up and boom homemade Two Face const ume. Keep smiling Strugglers.
12862,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I was born in 1995. I was vaccinated and still caught it in preschool.
12863,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: you are in no way being dramatic it is ridiculously painful. I had it a couple years ago also in my late 40's. All I can recommend is lots of ibuprofen and heating pads. Stay strong friend.
12866,I got shingles form last week and in 1st photo they are become dry but i am still itchy in other place like chest and arm and still appeared folliculitis like in 2nd photo in my chest .it is normal to keep getting new shingles even old shingles are dry?: After i got shingles i go to the doc in third day and he give me vaccine and medicinecream too.On 5th day my shingles got dry .But still appeard little folliculites.now on 10th day and i feel better and ok dude.Little folliculites are not appeard now.I heard shingles are need at least 3week to be they really Gone.I wish you too get well soon brother.
12867,RSV protection for infants: My situation was similar. I got mine at like 365 and my son was born 3 days later at 371 and went to the NICU for meconium aspiration needing respiratory support made him a priority for beyfortis. Which he got.
12870,Shingrix One  Done?: AF AIK Shin gri x is the only vaccine available in the you S. it is two dose x 200 B FWIW I just had the 1st dose May 4 th 1 year after having shingles. Fairly painful the injection site still a bit. No other issues for me. It seems to be highly individual much as Shingles itself.
12871,Response when asked if HPV vaccine should be taken.: This. Also a doc. I got the jab before I became sexually active and somehow got a bad strain of HPV anyway condoms and the vaccine are not 100 as soon as I became sexually active. There is nothing to say your first ever partner cannot pass it to you. They could also have caught it from non penetrative sex. Several colposcopies later I am on normal surveillance. I was unlucky that the jab did not work for me but 100 recommend everyone gets it. Why take that risk? Vaccinate before your kid becomes sexually active. People sexualise the vaccine far too much. We vaccinate children against rubella primarily to protect them as adult pregnant women and protect their foetuses after all.
12872,"Pharmacist provided wrong vaccine: Looking for some advice. My father visited a pharmacy for a Shingles vaccine, and was going to pay $12 for the shot. The pharmacist who administered said that no payment is needed for Covid shots. Turns out, the pharmacist administered the wrong shot, despite my father's doctor requesting a Shingles shot. Any advice on what to do here? TIA"
12873,Reoccurring shingles since 2019: First of all so sorry you deal with this it sucks I am in a similar boat though I have been getting shingles since I was 22 I am 37 M now. I have had it 16 times in 15 years and it is become more frequent since I got the Shin gri x vaccine 3 years ago. From my doctors recommendation I just started a daily regimen of val t rex 500 mg day and am hoping that will keep it at bay but I am not too optimistic at this point. I am in good health and shape like you so there is no health reason for this from all the tests and labs I have had done. However I am going to see a hormone specialist next week and am hoping that maybe I just am off in one of my hormones and fixing that might help who knows. Good luck and know you are not alone. That does not really make it easier but at least there is someone else in the same boat as you even if we do not know each other
12874,"Just got the COVID vaccine yesterday. Woke up with a burning rash on my arm where I got the shot. I've been trying to reach out to my healthcare provider, but haven't heard back yet. The itching is driving me crazy. Does anyone have any advice on how to treat this rash? I know some people experience skin reactions after getting the vaccine, but I'm not sure what the best course of action is. Help!"
12876,My arms hurt.: i did covid and flu together and allowed myself to spend a whole day in bed. sleeping and poking alternate arms to see how the postshot lump was coming along. covid definitely worse than flu. shingles sounds like its orders of magnitude though.
12880,Shingles shot Ack: I came looking for this. It was on my right b00b. At first I thought I got some of infection at the gym? And then I noticed they turned into cold sore like blisters and I was like damn. Calamine lotion and mega doses of lysine but I am so glad I got vaccinated because that patch the size of my palms being all over me for 7 days? Hell no
12881,Agree makes me nervous when I read I would probably feel bad for several days post shingles vaccine.
12882,Shingles vaccine: However you feel after the vaccine could not possibly be as bad as shingles. I know a few older people that got it and it was awful. My uncle felt like crap for over a year. Knocked my grad school advisor down for six months. Still felt bad for months afterwards. Incredible burning pain that no medication could stop.
12884,Pediatrician not giving vaccines: The other possible explanation is that if you have a SAHP and they are not in daycare rotovirus is so low risk that its not needed. We almost did not get it for our daughter a premie because she is at home no daycare no contact with other kids and we were concerned about her gut health at the time. She ended up being fine by the time the appointment rolled around so we got it but if her 4 month appt had been 3 weeks earlier we would have skipped it. You did not specify which was missing it and ages so that might play into it.
12886,FML... I got shingles: I Am so sorry shingles sucks I got my case before I was eligible for the shingles vaccine. It hit the left side of my face. Sores in ear and down my throat. I developed Ramsay Hunt Syndrome with facial paralysis and had viral sepsis and terrible vertigo. Spent 3 weeks in hospital. I hope if your child gets chickenpox that its mild and does not bother them too much.
12888,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles at 2930. Its the pirate disease between the shiver and the tingle its the shingles
12891,When my partner moved in there were issues from the start reactions that felt really outsized passiveaggressive and ultimately gaslighting. One of the early issues was when he asked if I minded his cousin stopping by after work which would usually have been no problem. But that day I had gotten a flu and shingles shot and was lowgrade sick and tired. Still I said sure no problem this was about 6 PM. When the cousin did not show up for a bit I asked when he would be getting off and he told me sometime around 11. I got upset about it because we have a very small house and showing up to get the party started at 11 just did not feel like it was OK that night. Nonetheless in the time we lived together he would never invite someone over again He is really into music which I knew and had no problem with before he moved in. Virtually every time l've ever been to his house music was playing and I expected it would be similar at our house. One day he was basically playing The Doors entire catalog and half joking I turned it down or off. He was enraged and basically would not play music in the house anymore. He would burn a candle in the bathroom for an hour a day and it got hard to clean the soot off the walls. I cautiously approached him about it given his reaction to previous issues basically said that I was having trouble getting the soot off the walls and hoped we could talk and figure out a solution together. Not only did he stop burning the candle in there but he started taking tepidmilitary showers saying that I had complained about the moisture problem and he was just trying to help me. Of course I never wanted anybody living with me to feel they could not take a hot shower. When I tried to talk to him about how uncomfortable it felt he raged about me trying to control his showers. Once he made a change like never inviting anybody over he would never back down. Worse he would deny that the changes had anything to do with the argument even though it was clear that they did which was crazymaking. It felt like I could not talk to him about any concerns without some unforeseen and ongoing punishment. I often did not handle it well alternating between trying to discuss it calmly and yelling at him about it and finally threatening to kick him out if he did not try to resolve things. He moved out without ever acknowledging his behavior blaming me and saying I was controlling. I felt that when he refused to ever do something again after even minor disagreements it gradually foreclosed more parts of our lives and I was always painfully aware that nothing was resolved. I am pretty clear that yelling at him was an asshole move and do not feel good about it but also have no idea what I could have done to get through to him. AITA?
12892,I am in my first week of shingles. It is spread over a generous area around the right side if my body lower back stomach and grointhigh. Last 3 days or so I am experiencing pain in my calf and the lower back where the pelvic bone sort of joins the spine. I was having difficulty sleeping down on my affected side but last night I could not even lie on my back due to the back pain. My initial thought was that I had been walking funny during the week because of the shingles but after having had plenty of rest on the weekend it is not getting better. Anyone else reckon shingles could be causing this?
12893,I work in health care. I hear stories all the time because I engage. One lady told me 20m after the injection she got shingles all over her neck.
12895,First time shingles and scared: If its any consolation I had a rash that looked just like yours. It was definitely shingles but I never had significant pain just some itching and a bit of a sunburn feeling. Not every case is intensely painful especially if you started on the anti viral right away.
12897,Second Shingles Shot: I felt like I got socked in the arm on one or both shots. It was not a big deal for me. I have heard of others that were really on their ass for a day or two. I guess I lucked out?
12898,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I got my first one last week. Zero issues other than a sore arm. Get the shot friends.
12899,"""Is there a connection between the COVID-19 vaccine and joint pain? I started experiencing severe joint pain after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. My doctor dismissed it as unrelated, but I can't shake the feeling that there might be a link. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the vaccine?"""
12902,Shingles vaccine: I got the shots right after turning 50. I had chicken pox twice as a kid which is rare. My mom SUFFERED with shingles so I did not want to take any chances. My only side effect was a sore arm each shot. No biggie.
12903,LONG story short Was on low dose Estrodial and stopped after 1.5 yrs due to sudden breast pain bloating. Tried Estrogen and Progesterone and realized after 3 days I cannot tolerate Progesterone at all. Now on Duavee day 3 and had severe abdominal pain like runners stitch for 36 hrs and think it may have triggered immuno issues that were dormant in body internal shingles. I am a mess. Anyone know if this is possible? Anyone have stomach pain on this medicine? Do not know what to do and need a replacement that will not bloat me or because pain. Thanks in advance.
12909,Shingles vaccine first dose side effects report: Yeah the shingles vaccine is known to be one of the unpleasant ones in terms of side effects. Sorry to hear its been rough for you. Nausea and headache are a common symptom of the vaccine as is fatigue. Good on you for getting the vaccine its far better than the disease. CDC says Most people have a sore arm after they get Shingrix. Many people have redness and swelling on their arm spanning several inches where they got the shot. Many people also feel tired or have muscle pain a headache shivering fever stomach pain or nausea. About 1 out of 6 people had symptoms severe enough to prevent them from doing regular activities.
12910,Sitting here after my 1st dose of the Shingles vaccine and
12911,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not remember this ever being a practice around where I lived. I do remember being told I needed the vaccine then I caught chicken pox like a week later lol. I was like yay no more vaccine
12912,Cardiologist recommended RSV vaccine even though I had it while pregnant anyone else?: Yes. I have four children. My third child has a severe heart defect and received the vaccine while I was pregnant and afterwards months later. My fourth child who does not have a heart condition also received the vaccine while I was eight months pregnant and then she was seven months old was offered again she is 8 months now.
12914,Shingles shot Ack: Yes Mine is still hot sore to the touch
12919,A few days after taking my first Ozempic shot I developed a rash that was extremely itchy. I went to the walk in clinic and it is shingles. I have never had shingles before but I did have chicken pox as a kid. The doctor told me that it could be because Ozempic weakened my immune system but did not because it. I am still going to take the shot because it seems to be healing just fine. Just a heads up FYI you MAY develop shingles from taking this medication. EDIT For everyone saying this is not a side effect shows you are lacking transparency. You can easily search this group others for shingles and many posts will pop up. In order for a side effect to be detected you must REPORT it. Instead of jumping the gun be understanding new side effects pop up all the time. It is being transparent to report them.
12922,I have seen a lot of people recounting their experience with shingles shortly after the covid vaccine. I got two shots and one booster but it has to have been at least over a year since I got my booster booster. I got shingles this year at 28. I m perplexed and wonder if anyone has experienced a delayed onset that they think may be connected to the covid vaccine vaccines. Interested to hear your responses. Thank you
12924,Shingles and methotrexate: I had shingles but I would been on mtx for a while over 6 months probably close to a year. I had to go off of it for like a month to get the blisters to clear up. It was awful. I had them from the base of my spine down my leg so I could sit or lie on my backleft side. Get the vaccine as soon as you can once you heal. I just got my 2nd dose last week at 40 y.o
12926,Anyone experience a sore arm after getting the flu shot? Just got my annual flu vaccine and my arm is really achy. Wondering if anyone else has had this reaction after getting the flu shot.
12930,Exactly my experience...never a reaction to a vaccine... shingles vaccines hurt me.
12931,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: 41. Got it at 38 from multiple excessively stressful situations in succession that were unavoidable. It would not go away for THREE YEARS. I spoke with multiple doctors specialists my insurance the CDC and Shingrex. All of them said I could not get vaccinations before 50 unless I paid out of pocket. I want to say it was 400600. Was not happening. The last outbreak I had was 8 months ago and mild enough that we decided to try the antivirals for a month. That seemed to work but I am pretty sure I have permanent nerve damage now and it made my preexisting chronic pain issues much worse.
12932,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I am 42 and I just had to get it because of a medication I take. I have never been so sick from a vaccine before. It still was not as bad as when I actually had shingles though at the ripe age of 19.
12937,Been there done that the shingles is the worse shot I Have had none of the others really bothered me but that one
12938,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: And not all dementias include significant memory loss. Many patients know their loved ones at the end but they are so brain damaged that they are not at all who they were. My mom has atypical Alz. She knows who everyone is but does not have the ability to empathize with or really love humans anymore. She is in the later stages. Completely immobile. But my mom does not ever say she does not want to live anymore and enjoys watching tv.
12940,Lichen planus? Hello everyone so I am here to see if anyone else has experience something similar to what has happened to me since i cannot find much information on it. By The Way I am seeing a dermatologist. I started on the 2.5mg for a month then went up to 5mg about 6 weeks in on 5mg around 1011 weeks total since starting MJ i started experiencing some burning sensation on some parts of my body almost like a sun burn. I also started experiencing more nerve pain on my back where i had shingles almost 8 years ago. The burning pain left but the nerve pain stay and that part of my body started becoming itchy as well. After all that next thing i can remember is was this tickling sensation on my lip thought i was getting a cold sore but i did not then i started getting the same sensation on my palms then the soles of my feet. Then my palms and soles started itching a lot Next thing i notice was i started getting these pink dots on my soles then this big oval pink spotrash on my palm. And after that it all went down hill. I started getting all types of different rashes bumps blisters all over my body. I honestly did not think it was from the shot. I thought at first i was getting bit by something then i thought it was eczema. I went to the urgent center which thought was hand foot and mouth. Fast forward went to a dermatologist at this point i was covered in these things they did two biopsies. And after 2 weeks it came back as a possible drug eruption. Doctor says it has to be the Mounjaro. And she called these spots or whatever they are Lichen. I googled and found lichen planus and some of the rashes do look very similar to it some do not. I was advice to stop MJ for now as they check me for some autoimmune diseases which came back high and positive. And i am currently on Prednisone for 10 days. I also have to follow up with my Endo. That was the one to prescribe it. Inam waiting for further testings and seeing what went wrong especially after 1011 weeks of already being on it. Also want to add that i ended up going up to 7.5mg beginning of December which probably made the situation worse. Now my question is has anyone experience anything similar to this? If so what did you do? What did the doctor do? What was the diagnosis if anything? the dermatologist said i might be able to try something else but if the blood work came back positive for an autoimmune disease i might not be able to do any of the injections. Which i am sad because my A1c is at the lowest it has been since I can remember and I Have also lost 30lbs since starting.
12942,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I was born in 1989 and had shingles brought on from extreme stress. Get the vaccine
12945,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: never presented with a rash just the pain moving back and forth between my shoulder blades and my chest. Doc gave me prednisone and it made it 100 times worse. Get that blood test if you think you have it but do not have a rash.
12946,First dose of Shingles vaccine was ROUGH 2nd one is easier promise. Good for you for getting it though.
12947,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1997. I identify as genZ more than millennial. I got chicken pox the old fashioned way. I plan on getting the shingles vaccine the day that I turn 50. I watched my step mother go through shingles and the pain in her eyes was pronounced and LOUD. I wish they would lower the age limit so I could get the vaccine NOW. My dad got chicken pox with me when I had it. He almost died. He was in the ICU for 7 days lost all of his body weight he was 130 pounds as a 6 foot 4 man and became a she will of himself. He was only 32.
12948,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Had it at 47 and it was bad but the same year I had a heart issue that shot pain from my heart up to my brain every time I moved or lay flat. Wanted to die. Made the shingles pain feel like a walk in the park.
12949,"Covid vaccine went not so great.. now I'm looking for some advice from anyone who has gotten the shingles/pneumonia vaccines: Hi everyone, I am switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus soon and my neurologist has recommended me getting the shingles and pneumonia vaccine before starting Ocrevus. But I'm really nervous to get these vaccines, or at least the shingles one, because I have heard it makes people feel pretty ill for a few days. Now, normally that would not deter me, however I recently got the Covid vaccine (Pfizer shot 1&2) and it gave me a really bad pseudo flare of my MS symptoms. It was a worse flare up than I have ever experienced before. I was in an incredible amount of pain and discomfort. I was really weak and could not walk for 4 days (normally I can walk but I do have limited mobility. I normally use crutches/walker). I had to take more than a week of sick leave out of work. Without going into any further gory details, It was bad. Now, I'm really concerned about getting these vaccines too. Does anyone have any advice or your own stories of getting these vaccines? Did they cause any pseudo flare ups for you? Has anyone else gotten the Covid vaccine and had a similar experience?"
12951,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Gen X here. Just got my shingles vaccine Its a b1tch.
12956,I posted this in rpregnant but not one person responded... Prescription medication... Shingles... Hi all I am sorry if this question has been asked but i have gotten shingles in my 3rd trimester here I am at 33 weeks and I am having unbearable pain I spent a good 5 days crying ever since the.the blister formed and now it is all over the right side of my scalp... well yesterday the pain was too much the doctor gave me two IV doses of dilaudid and now about 4 days worth of Oxy to help with the pain.. I feel like a terrible person doing this but my stress is through the roof I was not sleeping... ans the Oxy does not work as good as the IV meds but am I doing the right thing? He gave them to me so the antiviral has time to work because I have taken 20 of those in two days so far 24 counting today. I do not know when the antiviral will help it I do not know when the pain will subside... I am so scared of harming the baby and they told me it is safe but what constitutes as safe? Am I going to get withdrawal within the 4 or 5 days even if taken as directed? It is 14 pills. Will that harm the baby? I will probably ask my midwife as well but I wanted to see if anyone here has gone through the same troubles... he is been moving just fine and seems perfectly happy but god damn if I do not feel like a bad mom already.
12959,TN and shingles vaccine: I Have had chronic shingles about 10 year now. I got the vaccine two years ago and it has slowed me getting shingles. It used to be 68 a year and now its down to two. I feel the slightest tingle and I start the meds so it does not get as bad or as long so I would do it again. I wondered about a connection and reading this has confirmed my suspicions.
12960,41 and got Shingles: Thankfully I Have been vaccinated against shingles possibly over a decade ago but that is because we had to enter CNA work.
12961,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I was terrified before I got my shots but they were fine. I took two aleve before each shot though. Maybe that helped?
12962,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have to admit I laughed when they told her that Trash had gotten shingles. She certainly deserved it. Shingles is a terribly painful thing my MILwho would NEVER have done such a thing came down with shingles and almost lost her sight in one eye. It was terrible and she was in so much pain. I cannot help but think this was Trash's karmic punishment for pulling such a terrible stunt. I hope OOP left her mama's boy husband and got full custody. I hope a judge would never give the father any sort of custody in this awful situation.
12964,Get the shingles vaccinations. My hubby had them in his ear. He had permanent damage to his hearing balance and his face is partially paralyzed. I Am immune compromised so prone to shingles. At least with the vaccine they are only mild cases. Shingles are not fun
12966,First time shingles and scared: Hey. I do not have any words to make you less scared but your case sounds exactly what I Am going through right now. Hell the rash on my back even LOOKS like yours. My first time getting these too. Started last Thursday pain and tingling on my right side. Over the weekend I developed a rash on my back that was about fist sized. Got a matching one on my stomach about the size of a silver dollar. My core connecting those two spots burns. I started Valtrax on Monday. My rash did not get any worse after I started the meds but from reading on here some say it might for a day or two. Today is day 3 of taking them for me and the nerve pain has finally subsided. Just itchy. But that I can manage. As much as this sucks I Am trying to be grateful that its not completely crippling or in my eyes or something. Doom scrolling through here I see that some get it much worse. Hang in there and take those pills. You Will get better.
12969,Anyone used antiviralsacyclovir while suffering with LC?: I very recently had shingles and took it. I Am always nervous about new medication I Am known to react to lots of things but I did fine with the anti viral Valtrex. It works best the sooner you take it so if he is open to it get it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I took it within 15 hours of the blisters appearing and it definitely kept my rash on the mild side. I did not have any side effects nor did any of my LC issues get worse I do have a lot of nerve pain with LC so it was hard to separate what was shingles pain from my usual pain but that pain began before the anti viral. I Have had LC for over three years. Began with a vaccine reaction then got worse after a later infection. I was hoping the anti viral might help my LC but it did not. It only helped the shingles. Also I put apple cider vinegar on the rash to help dry it out I found this more helpful than calamine lotion.
12970,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Even with the vaccine my son has been already two times in the hospital for three nights to monitor his breath and oxygen before turning 6 months old. We have a 3yo at home that goes to elementary school toygh. Without the vaccine we were told by the neumologist that this would have gone infinitely worse and from the first cold he got he probably would had needed oxygen and proably we would have been a lot more staying at the hospital.
12973,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: The only pain after the shots was a sore tight arm. There is a lot of vaccine in those shotsthe pharmacist said that is why it is two instead of one which makes sense. So for me it was a slightly warm upper arm and waking myself up when I rolled onto that side. It was two or three days of minor discomfort but some people say it gave them a fever. Not me. And I am a true wuss about shots so I promise you I am not downplaying it. And the vaccine did not give me headaches either which is my first breath signal that shingles is cranking up. I was amazed to read so many posts where people felt the vaccine made them sick. It was just not the case with me. And my immune system is kind of crap.
12974,Shingles Is NO Joke: I am 45 and got them almost 3 years ago. I hope you get rid of them quickly and there are no lasting effects. I am still feeling it.
12981,Chinas New Virus Outbreak What We Know So Far USChina Relations Hacking: Many people Who have taken Covid vaccine reported slow and poor response to diseases since vaccine. It is reported that its like a immune system reset or as if the immune system is overwhelmed with something else and is slow to respond to nonCovid infection
12982,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1962 for me age 3 along with 3 siblings and my dad. He stayed home from work for three weeks and taught us kids card games. From Go Fish to Cribbage to Hold'them. Mom was not happy with the last one. Definitely got the Shingles vaccine had damn near every side effect listed but so far no Shingles fingers crossed and knocking on wood.
12984,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: My sister and I had a horrible case of it in Nov of 1963. We were 1112. We were covered in pox from our scalps to in between our toes and we were soooo sick. High fever. Sweaty. In pain. Itchy. We could not wear anything because clothes hurt our skin and rubbed against the pox. At our worst we just lay in bed barely able to have a sheet over us. My mom worked and had to just leave us at home to fend for ourselves. Our big sister had moved out that fall and was working the night shift as a telephone operator but she came over when she could and put calamine lotion on our spots and fed us frozen peaches. Our mouths also had sores so it helped numb those and tasted so good The hardest part was not scratching and leaving permanent scars. Weirdly enough we were lying on the couch watching soap operas or The Price Is Right or some such on TV when the news flashed that President Kennedy had been shot. And later that he diedI watched Walter Cronkite announce that. I immediately called my school and told them and they did not believe me I told them to turn on the radio and listen. I also called the High School and told them the same thingto listen to the radio. I then called my mom to tell her. We were all so stunned. We lived just 100 miles from Dallas in a small town and everyone was excited he was coming to Texas and to Big D. A little while later a 12yr old friend I knew in Dallas called me long distance to say she had gone to see him and had just waved and cheered as the motorcade passed by just a few blocks before the shots rang out. Most of the Dallas schools were closed that day so families could go line the streets to greet the President and his wife. I am not sure why my friend called me or thought I would be home that day to get the call. I think she was just in shock and wanted to tell someone she saw him and she was there. Eventually all the schools in my town announced it over the loud speaker system and my friends told me teachers and students alike were crying. So for me chickenpox always brings back the memory of that memorable day. I also got Shingles and had it for months when I was in my late 40's. Not surprised because I had a really high titer of the OG virus to begin with so there is a lot hidden in me. I am fully vaccinated now with both Shingles vaccines. Shingles is painful and can be dangerous so if you have not had the shots consider getting protected.
12985,First time shingles: I had shingles on my left side of my upper face affected my eye and gave me iritis. Your doctor should have been closely monitoring you because of the location of the outbreak. Shingles around the eye can be dangerous to your vision. I Am glad it seems you are recovering. Having shingles in my face was the absolute worst experience.
12990,Under 35 with Shingles?: I am on day 7 since the rash started and mine is more itch than anything with the occasional zaps. cannot vaccinate until after 55 or something which is annoying
12991,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I got shingles at 33 felt like someone lit a dagger on fire and stuck it into my right shoulder blade. I got permanent nerve damage from it so lucky me gets to experience that pain every single day for the rest of my life. Do Not complain about a vaccine.
12994,On neck expanding to jaw and shoulder: 44 and just diagnosed with it on my neck jawline ear and hairline. I was in the worst pain of my life with shooting pains in head which was diagnosed asTrigeminal neuralgia. The rash came the next day. I Have just been consistent with the antiviral meds steroidsCarbamazepine and pain meds. It finally has stopped the sharp head pains and blisters are forming. Meds are the most important to get things under control.
12995,41 and got Shingles: I got them at 23. They were a result of repressing an emotional response to a traumatic experience. I guess I was lucky because they did not hurt just itched.
12997,"""Worried sibling needs help: My sister (30) recently got her flu shot and has been feeling unwell ever since. She's been dealing with a high fever, body aches, and a sore throat for the past few days. Her doctor suspects it might be a viral infection, but she's not getting better with rest and medication. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to the flu vaccine? Any advice on how to help her recover would be welcomed, thank you!"""
12998,Shingles shot: Getting my second one today actually first one I had no issues whatsoever but I Am braced for the worst since people say that its either the first or the second that knocks you flat.
12999,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I had shingles about 2 yrs ago and i was exhausted Did the pain medicine and antivirals may have to do Something with it? Yes but the pain and your body trying to fight what is wrong definitely is exhausting
13004,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: No no reaction to either shingles doses.
13006,Finally out of my flare loving rinvoq more than I should as it is not a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: Well it spread down half my Ieg over night. So that is fun.
13007,"Mild shingles for a week, is it over?: I got shingles one week ago -- little blisters actually appeared before the pain and tingles. I had one Shingrix shot earlier this year, and I think that helped make it a mild case. I was prescribed a week of valacyclovir remotely by an NP (it happened while visiting my parents out of town.) Am I out of the danger zone and can I return to the gym? Only remaining symptom is very mild pins-and-needles feeling that comes & goes. I'm not getting any medical guidance so I don't know what to do."
13009,Shingles vac: I am 34 and got the shingles vaccine this year. At around 30 or so I had shingles and it was terrible and I would do everything in my earthly power to never have to do that again I would take a third liver transplant over getting shingles again. As for the flu vaccine I get it every year it is one that I have never experienced any side effects from and is good to get as the flu can get severe if you are on immunosuppressant s As a note they would not let me get the shingles vaccine while on prednisone so if you do get it you might have to be off it first before getting the vaccine
13011,RSV vaccine side effects: I never had any side effects not even a sore arm
13012,Shingles shot: I Have never ever felt ill from a vaccine not even covid and I Have done the multiple boosters. I wonder if this means my immune system is not great
13014,Is this the one where I did the two jab regiment for Shingles??? Yea agree. That was not fun.
13016,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Thank God you got it. I suffer with shingles every 3'ish months. Super painful.
13019,"All Rashes are Psoriasis (rant): Sooo I have Psoriasis, for over 10 years. Every single time I get a rash the doctor tells me it's just my Psoriasis!!!! So far the things I've been told are 'just' my Psoriasis are; Shingles (so missed the point I could have taken antivirals) Allergic reaction (until it escalated and had to go to a&e) Scarlett Fever (I got really sick because I hadn't been given antibiotics) Now I have this weird rash down my arms, I have no idea what it is, and a doctor has told me once again it's 'just' Psoriasis. I know it's not, I know what Psoriasis feels like, this is not that! Aghhhhhh"
13021,It breaks down your immune system so your body cannot fight diseases. My husband was diagnosed with two different kinds of cancer and got shingles all within 6 months of getting the vaccine which our doctor forced us to get.
13024,FML... I got shingles: Gosh that sounds so horrible. I hope you are better now. I am terrified of it to be honest. It is mostly on my neck and a bit in my scalp and I have skin sensitivity in my hand and arm on the same side. I am trying to watch out well what I am eating and I am working because I know I will need to be off when my baby gets chickenpox
13026,This is not a common thing and not something I thought I was going to have to deal with but I did so I wanted to do a little writeup for anybody else who searches for this later. I saw nothing on my own subreddit search so I would guess this is very uncommon for hysterectomy patients and that makes sense given that most of us are younger and thus far more likely to be healthy. My only chronic issues have been endometriosis and obesity. I am relatively healthy mid30's and rarely go to the doctor. I get sick a few times a year with your typical respiratory viral stuff and I know my immune system reacts pretty dramatically to things but I would not consider myself chronically ill aside from my endometriosis. I am certainly not immunocompromised. I had surgery on Friday 67. Trapped gas has always been painful postop for me so I knew I really needed to be on my heating pad walking around take the max dose GasX chewables every day and trying to absorbmove any leftover gas. By Monday I felt something was not right. This gas pain I was feeling should have been getting better and was instead only getting worse. Every time I tried to take a deep breath I felt a stabbing pain in my right ribcage and I had a lot of pain in my right shoulder radiating into my arm as well as a smaller amount of pain in my left shoulderradiating into left arm. It felt like someone pinching and stabbing my shoulder joints every time I moved much. I had changed into a sports bra on Saturday night and did not end up taking it off until Monday because I barely left my bed in between. As soon as I lifted it up I saw shingles clusters under both breasts. I knew what they were immediately since I have had shingles before about 5 years ago but even I was shocked by this. It is very rare for shingles to go across the midline in the body and it is rare to get them postop if you are not immunocompromised. I immediately went in the next day and got it diagnosed and treated with a 1 week course of Valtrex and some gabapentin for nerve pain. I still have some lingering right shoulderarm pain if I walk too much or use that arm too much but it is pretty easily controlled by the medicine for now and I am hopeful it will resolve fully within the next 4 weeks. The biggest thing to know is that if you have had chicken pox shingles are always a possibility for you. Shingles can happen after any big stressor the first time I had them it was brought on by a change from working night shifts to working day shifts. And shingles can hide especially for those of us with large breasts. With everything feeling so swollen and painful postop I did not recognize the pain as being a separate issue as quickly as I should have. You want to start on an antiviral medicine within 72 hours of the skin breaking out in order to prevent nerve damage and longterm nerve pain so recognition and early treatment are vital. Wishing you all the best of luck and hopefully no one else gets shingles
13030,New ones. Shingrix. The one where you need two shots. I had no trouble at all. No headache or anything.
13032,We have been caring for an elderly relative who developed shingles a month ago. She is vaccinated so the symptoms were relatively mild swelling blistering and transient localized neuralgia. She received all the proper meds and I added RLT to areas I could reach holding a belt 660850 nm a few inches from her skin. This is by no means a scientific assessment but the RLTtreated areas healed faster and there appears to be a reduction in neuralgia. Hope this helps someone suffering....
13036,Hi I am 38F and just joined the club last week. It started with phantom itching on my right rib followed by a deep ache on that rib. I thought I had cracked a rib from all the scratching or something. The pain quickly spread to my back muscles on the right side and was so severe I was having difficulty just moving around and doing normal life things. The pain got worse until 34 days later I woke up with a rash on the right where my back hurt worst and got into urgent care was diagnosed with shingles and started on famvir cannot tolerate valtrex. 48 hours later I am getting some tingling and itching on my left side and was trying to convince myself I am just being a hypochondriac...until I got the nowfamiliar pain under my left rib. I am pretty certain I am now getting shingles in the mirror image on my left side and can expect the blisters within the next couple days if it follows the same pattern. Is this normal especially given that I was on famvir already when this spread to the other side? How concerned should I be that this is happening out of the blue?
13037,My 7weekold is getting the RSV shot tomorrow. Id love to hear about others experiences with it. Has anyone had any negative reactions or issues? Please share
13038,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: I got them last year to young for the vaccine. It was brutal. I have scaring as well.
13039,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: When my older sister got it at school my mom made sure both me and my other sister got it from the oldest. I was like 34 I think. I vaguely remember being itchy for a week and having socks up to my elbows.

13042,Anyone Under 50 got their shingles vaccine: Did Not have any side effects from it at all myself other than a couple of days of sore arm at the injection site.
13043,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Just got my second shot a couple days ago one of my coworkers got shingles a few months ago it was brutal.
13046,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: Just got mine too apparently the second is worse.
13047,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Shingles was probably the worst 2 weeks of my life so a few days of fatigue is worth it.
13049,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had zero side effects from both shots other than a sore arm for a few days. Had Shingrix.
13051,Shingles vaccine: The second shot kicked my ass and I have zero regrets.
13054,I actually did Shingles and Covid and maybe even flu all at the same time figured if I was going to get whammied might as well do it at the same time Although I think the 2 shingles shot hit me harder all by itself.
13055,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Yeah i had all the vaccine and got shingles at 18 man that sucked bad.
13056,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: I started feeling like myself again just last Wednesday which marked 4 weeks Tomorrow is the 5 week mark. First 3 weeks are definitely rough... once I hit week 4 man what a difference My eye felt normal again for the first time in a month. An entire month I did not know you were going through it right now too My rash was completely gone within the first week but mine was caught early thankfully I just have 1 spot of discoloration on my forehead and another in my hairline which I have been treating with my vitamin C serum and avoiding direct sunlight there. Lol. Otherwise you would not even be able to tell I had Shingles And I looked bad when I got it Like really bad. I could not open my eye either
13059,31 yr old male: The funny thing about shingles is that yours almost look exactly like mine almost the exact locations. Anyway rest well and take meds it will be OK eventually I guess. Mine is already 3 months it is a lot better now just some itchyness in the mornings or when I get really sweaty.
13061,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I got shingles at 48 this fall. It was brutal. Four little blisters on my face. Pain like I had never experienced.
13064,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got fucking shingles at 37 right after I had a baby. It feels like a million little sharp knives stabbing you. The nerve pain is real
13065,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I was all set to do the Suite of HalfCentury Medical Shit the week after my 50th birthday full physical colonoscopy shingles vaccine but well I turned 50 on March 13 2020. If you check your calendar you will find that was the weekend the world shut the fuck down for COVID. It took me a couple years to catch up and in that time I got a very mild case of shingles. I say it was mild it may just have been that I clocked it super quickly and had antivirals in my system within 24 hours of the first little sore bump on my forehead. It accelerated the whole thing so the pain was limited to about 36 hours and I only had like 4 or 5 lesions and it never spread from just below my hairline. It LOOKED gross as hell for about week yay hats but I took a gnarly selfie and made my age peers look at it while yelling GET YOUR FUCKING SHINGLES SHOTS. It worked.
13067,: This is terrifying. My oldest daughter ago 43 and my youngest son ago 25 took this medical intervention. My son has been sick more over the last two years than in his entire 25 years of life I am so very worried for my children. The drug pushers are guilty of murder in my opinion. I am worried . angry poutingface .
13068,Shingles shot: First one I had a sore arm second was even less pain. Wife got knocked on her butt with the first one second was not as bad. Still way better than the shingles. I had an uncle old guy born in the 20s had the shingles and said it was the worst pain he ever had. This guy accidentally cut his thumb off and said shingles was way worse Get the shot.
13069,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My aunt had it so bad after chemotherapy she still has nerve damage in her legs from it. I had chicken pox twice as a child and shingles twice as an adult once in my late 30's and once in my early 40's. I asked my doctor to have the vaccine. He said insurance would not pay for it because I am too young 44. I said I would pay outofpocket I am naturally immunocompromised and every time I get it it is worse. So he wrote the prescription but I cannot find any pharmacy who will give it to me for another 6 years...
13072,Hello I Am trying to reach out for help. I have tried the last 18 years to get help for myself. I have been dealing with a lifetime of medical problems. I am a 55 year old male. I do not think too clearly get dizzy and get headaches. I have been fighting terrible sleep problems for many years. I Am always tired and run down. I have a You Tube video called Please Help Me I Need Medical Help that might also be helpful. I have been fighting my health and myself to prepare this. I do not smoke drink or do drugs. I watch what I eat and drink. I have been diagnosed and misdiagnosed for different ailments over the years. I have had lifetime neurology problems since after having chicken pox after the age of 4. I had bad chicken pox in the left side of my scalp and all over my face. I remember my mother saying it was very bad. My mother also had ovarian cysts removed around the time I was born. Since I was 4 years old problems top left side nerve scalp problems that first affected by right foot and then my legs. 2 months ago I went to both the dentist and eye doctor visits and after their examinations my legs gave out on me and got bad headaches. I have problems for the last 7 years when I scratch nerve spots on left side of scalp face and on my legs. They all generate toward my top left side of my scalp where I have had problems since I was 4 years old. One spot on my left hand caused bad head and neck problems or sensations. I thought I was going to have a stroke. It settled down 8 hours later. I had a nerve spot on my left eyebrow that when I scratched it sent electricity up and down my legs to my feet. I have little blood spots all over my body and on the left side of my scalp. I have had the left side of my face tighten on and off for the last few months. My scrotum is look like leather. I alternate between bad headaches and collapsing legs. My legs have been slowly diminishing for the last 20 years. I get dizzy standing with either my eyes open or closed. I tested positive 4 years ago for small fiber neuropathy. When I put earbuds to listen to music I get bad sensations around my left ear down my face to my jaw. My right ear get a little sensation. I was diagnosed in my left bottom crumbling teeth with external root absorption. My eyes have been light sensitive since I was 12. I have had burning 2 times in the center of my eye and I can get involuntary eye blinking or fluttering. I can get in my left peripheral vision either fireworks diamond images or cracked glass that looks like rain coming down. I have blood shot eyes after I shampoo my hair in the shower. A few moths ago during a 2 week period I had small clumps of hair on my shower curtain and in the tub. I have had 2 CT Scans in the past that have shown an undetermined cyst or a nodule problem in my left sphenoid sinus and maxillary area. I also had a CT Scan that showed an undetermined inflammation cell in my left eye. I have had burning the last few months on the left side of my face left side of nostril and left side of my lips. I did have burning after a recent bowel movement that affected my scrotum anus and butt. I have had in the past yellow and blood mucous balls coming out of my left nostril. My right foot has tightened off and on since I was 12 years old. I had shingles in 2006 on my left waist and 2013 on the left side of my stomach. My creatinine level is at 1.23 mgdl. My PSA Prostate test is at 4.34H and my LDLCholesterol is high at 101 H. I went to the emergency room 8 months ago for my kidneys and threw up twice when I was there. It was the 2nd time in 4 years I had to go there for my kidneys. I have had burning and itching in my lymph nodes in my armpits and under both side of my jaw. I have problems with my body temperature and I have been losing weight the last few years. I do get once in a great while a silver metallic taste in my mouth when I turn my head to the right. I have lost my memory a few times turning my head to the right and scratching my scalp. A few months ago I almost was ready to throw up when I touched the on the top left side of my head and the back left side of my neck. These were 2 separate incidents that happened close together. I stopped drinking coffee and using spaghetti sauce. They caused severe violent headaches that I thought something was going to burst through. I still get bad headaches. I had problems 2 days ago with having tea with skim milk in the morning and had 2 apples at night. An hour after eating the apples I took 8 lysine capsules before going to bed. An hour after taking the lysine my right and then my left foot tightened and throbbed almost simultaneously. This was before going to bed and I had problems sleeping. I have problems being in hot weather. I once was working outside in 90 degree weather and my adrenal glands were not working. My PCP thought I had Addison's disease. Went to the endocrinologist and he put fluid in me and things somewhat returned to normal. I also went outside in the hot sun one time and had a strip of area in the top left side of my scalp burning. I took antibiotics and slowly went away the few days after. I get multiple colds all year long. My head and neck become so tight they feel like they are going to burst. For the last 7 years my Chiropractor Osteopath and Physical therapist has said my neck and body is very tight to work on. My sleep is very bad. I get alternating sleep on different nights. On December 17 2023 August 2nd 2024 and August 29th 2024 something inside the left side of my head and neck had tried to shut me down while sleeping. I fought to stay awake and not shut down. I did have a high white blood cell count from taking IV Ceftriaxone Rocephin and yellow liquid Atovaquone together. The doctor stopped them immediately. My great grandfather died young at 48 years old from a lung ailment and my mother died from complications from sarcoidosis. I have once in a great while a spot on my upper back left lung that when I breath especially when I get a cold I can feel it. I tested for a few Sarcoidosis tests but have come back negative. When I take out the trash I cannot do it without by legs buckling and collapsing when I bend over to tie up the bag. I start to cough a lot when I bend over and crouch down. When I do lay my head at night before sleep I feel some pressure on the left side of my head and neck Hopefully this is helpful information and I appreciate anybody taking the time to read this and try to help me.
13075,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I was born in 91' and I got shingles 5 years ago... Let me tell you that pain is excruciating I literally had no idea what shingles even was before that. Anyways go get your vaccine because that shit sucked Lol
13076,Yes a number of people got shingles after the Covid shot
13077,Last year I was diagnosed with HPV after noticing severe warts on my vaginal and anal areas. I want to note that I have never engaged in anal sex so I Am unsure how I developed warts in that areaperhaps from a razor. My Pap smear last year came back negative. This summer I underwent cauterization to remove the warts but they returned. I am currently using Aldara and while sometimes it feels like the warts are reducing at other times they do not seem to improve. I also take immunosuppressive medication which I suspect may be contributing to the persistence of the warts. Recently I received the second dose of the Gardasil 9 vaccine. However my main concern is that the warts around my anus have never fully gone away and keep reappearing. I strongly believe I may have warts inside my rectum which could be causing them to recur externally. How can I confirm this 100? What is the safest procedure to diagnose and address warts in the rectum?
13081,"Received the HPV vaccine yesterday and I'm feeling awful. My joints are swollen and painful, and I have a fever that reached 102.8degF. I wasn't prepared for such a strong reaction. Does anyone with rheumatoid arthritis have a similar experience with vaccines? I have a few more shots scheduled but I'm hesitant to go through this again. Any recommendations on managing these side effects?"
13085,Update 1 4 PM. Mother just voided and the urine is brownish with no smell and cloudy. Should we go to the ER? I am sorry about the harried nature of this post. I have been going since 736 AM this morning. Back ground Mother 64 is the patient. She was recently dx'd with cervical cancer but we are so early in the journey we do not even know the stage yet. We were so hoping for IIB or an earlier III but now I am not so sure. When she had her morning pee she noticed that it was pink tinged AND with some concern there was a blood clot in with it. She called me straight away and I rushed over to look. At first it did not look that bad but she made herself pee again and we were able to capture it in a mason jar  do not judge me  which we then put into a small clean clear tupperware  please do not judge us we threw it away . It was cloudy and DEFINITEY pink with blood. I called telenurse immediately and asked what to do. She told us to go to her ONCOLOGIST whom we have not yet formally seen and will not see until Dec 10th. Still we did what we were told drove the 30 minutes to that cancer center and explained everything to that receptionist and that nurse. After a little confusion  you need to see this doctor we were told to see you oh but you are not our patient YET etc  we convinced them to let her give a urine sample to rule out maybe a UTI something like that. Now no shame I watched my mother pee to see if I could rule anything out. She almost filled that sample cup pink urine but no clots. However when she finished peeing and stood up clots in the bowl They are dark and lumpy they remind me of period clots so surely she would feel that coming out of her urethra???? But when she cleans herself urethra and vaginal opening NO BLOOD??? She tried to get the nurse to come look in the bowl but the nurse just kept reiterating this is normal with cervical cancer this is normal with cervical cancer. Well ... IS IT???? I called that doctor's office back and asked for the doc to call me and get the full picture. I know that the nurses are busy I know we did not have an appt but we did what the telenurse said. They were not mean or dismissive but I would just feel better knowing the truth from survivors and patients.
13086,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Get your vaccine as soon as possible. I am going into my sixth week of shingles on the face and head I lost track of the dates to get my vaccine Now it will be six months from diagnosis till I can get vaccinated for shingles flu and C OVID. Two months off of work.
13091,Cin1Cin2 have anyone gotten the Gardasil Vaccine: Yes diagnosed with CIN2CIN3 and I had the Gardasil vaccine in primary school. Think its routine in Australia and New Zealand
13093,Shingles vaccine: I can also confirm I had a bad case in my neck and face the nerve pain took months to go it was just before I got diagnosed with RA.
13094,Should I get shingles vaccine?: From my experience with it. I say no. It caused my outbreaks to come back to back for 16 months.
13095,Had both Shingles shots this year . No reaction whatsoever. I do not know anyone that has a reaction to either shot.
13097,Shingles vac: I got shingles at 20 due to having I BD and being on immunosuppressant s. 010 would not recommend. Bleeding pus oozing painful sores that were not fun at all to say the least. When the Shin gri x vaccine came out I got it as soon as possible as I really do not want to go through that again.
13101,Shingles Sucks: I got it last month for the first time in my 53 years My dad was in the hospital almost dying and I was so stressed out that I got shingles on the left side of my face. I did not know what it was so five days later I went to the doctor and he immediately told me it was shingles and I got medicine. Obviously the medicine does not cure it but it alleviated the symptoms. I still have little red spots under my nose and under my left eye where it started. And what is crazy is one of my top teeth were killing me and I could not chew on the left side. But its fine now. I guess it was on the nerve line they said. So I will have to wait a couple months to get vaccinated for it after this outbreak. Hang in there
13105,I neee help: I contracted Shingles right before Thanksgiving and am now struggling with PHN Post hepatic Neuralgia. I feel your pain. I did a bunch of online research and found that Vitamin B12 VB12 helps to repair damaged nerves. I think the Recommended Dietary Allowance RDA is 2.4 ug aka mcg per and only provides that as an average. But some of the research I did suggests taking 1000 ug of VB12 daily. They say it provides the amount of VB12 necessary to repair the significant nerve damage done by the virus. Repair the damage reduce the pain  yeah? That makes sense to me. So I am currently self medicating with a 60 ug dose of VB12 daily. I will also get a micronutrient blood test the next time I see the doc about my PHN. I think we are all pretty much on our own in this area. VB12 is not reported in nutrition labels and it is not documented on a CBC Complete Blood Chemistry the classic blood test we all take. But you can ask your doctor to test for it. may even be able to get a micronutrient blood which should provide you with the levels of all the vitamins and minerals in your body. As a kid I had VB12 shots ouchies and in my 20's developed EpsteinBarr which as it turns out is in the herpes family of viruses and acts like mononucleosis. At the time the medical community was debating whether it even existed but my doctor ignored the debate and tried to help. We began by taking a micronutrient blood panel that gave information on practically all the levels of vitamins and minerals vm in my bloodstream. Then he told me which vm to buy OTC and take daily. He also helped me to choose the brands that we would use. I took a monthly micronutrient blood panel and we would compare the vm levels to the previous testing. He would adjust the intake amount of vm accordingly. Over time I felt more energetic less brainfoggy and other symptoms also lessened or disappeared altogether. I was able to return to college after treatment during the 4 month summer break. I elected to reduce class schedule and continued treatment for another 4 or 5 months. I maintained that focus on the vm levels in my blood for decades after that. Fifty plus years later I still megadose vm taking about 4 times the suggested RDM but these days I can take it in one pill rather than having to purchase each vitamin or mineral separately. Perhaps if you did a deep dive into your own body's vm levels you would have more information with which to decide if adjusting them to more closely reflect a higher level than the RDA suggests would promote a more healing environment in your body. Best of luck.
13110,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got shingles at 49. It suuuucked. Get the vaccine.
13113,Sacral Nerve Shingles and Secondary Urine Retention: Being immunocompromised makes shingles more severe. Also increases the chances of more severe symptoms
13115,Do you guys know if AS patient can take tetanus vaccine?: I have had tetanus booster both shingrix prevnar 20 annual flu and biannual covid vaccines while on enbrel. If you are worried about anything it does not hurt to messagecall and leave a message for your rheum to confirm it is okay to do. I did not experience a strong reactionincrease in symptoms after any of the vaccines except shingrix and that is just due to my messy history with chickenpox and its vaccines. Best of luck
13117,Shingles and influenza: Ugh I did not realize how long the symptoms could last I have narcolepsy so I Am already exhausted 247. This sucksssssss
13123,Shingles shot: I had the real deal shingles last December. I am still dealing with lingering issues. I am going to beg my doctor for the vaccine even though I am still not technically eligible for 5 years. We have spent 45k between ER visits 2023 deductible year and bimonthly visits to my eye doctor 2024 deductible year on shingles alone. I will gladly pay OOP for the vaccine if I can get it early.
13126,33f went to urgent care because of rash turns out its shingles: That is good. I hope it helps. Spraying on the calamine was torture for me because it was soooo cold. Night time is definitely the worst. It seems any virus gets worse at night.
13127,Shingles vaccine: I got it had some side effects. That is normal for my body. I get my vaccines on Fridays in case I have a reaction so I can rest on the weekend. My friends Mom got Shingles in her EYE and I have a coworker who got it very bad down her legs and back. Save if you need but get that shot. Also ask the pharmacy if they have any coupons. I Have done that at CVS and its saved me money
13128,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Yep. Just got my first dose. I want no part of shingles. Feeling shitty for a few days is far preferable. A friend had it a few months ago and got an infection from it went septic was in the hospital on massive antibiotics and needs some plastic surgery for the scarring on her face. No thank you.
13132,Shingles vaccine: Good way to think about the vaccine. I have had half a dozen older friends get shingles and they said it was the most pain they ever felt. Two of them had it on their eyelids and they said it was excruciating. The feeling like ass for 36 hours beats a painful rash on my eyelids or groin as one of my friends delicately told me every day and 2x on Sunday.
13135,Started at 10mg a cautionary tale: Appreciate your vulnerability in sharing this post. I was So worried I would do this. With my second shot I pushed the syringe in before it hit my skin..not sure how I did it.just stood there looking and shaking my head. Geeeez.now I go super slow. Be kind to yourself and know its smooth sailing from here.
13138,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: If I drink on it I get sooo drunk and have horrible hangovers even if I have 2 drinks
13139,Can an Adult (66F) with shingles pass the virus to a vaccinated toddler (2F) or baby?: I just found out my aunt has shingles and saw my 2.5 year old daughter earlier today. I know it's the same virus as chicken pox but my toddler daughter has been vaccinated against chicken. Is there any risk at all that she will get chicken pox?
13143,Shingles vaccine: Just a sore arm for me.
13144,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Why is it worse after puberty?
13146,Shingles vaccine: Yes I got the shot. No terrible side effects just a little lethargic after each. Both my parents had shingles. My dad had it in his 30s. My mom got it in her 70s but it was such a mild case she was not sure what it even was.
13148,mRNA future: Do you know why they are pushing the Shingles vaccine The COVID vaccine affects that part of the immune system that keeps viruses we are carrying in check. Quite a few people are breaking out in Shingles after their COVID jab.
13149,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Never did the party but def had it as a kid. Had shingles when I was 20 on my head and face. 37 now. Still the most pain and discomfort I Have ever felt in my life. Cannot even describe the migraines. Truly feel for you hope you have a speedy recovery
13150,Shingles Duration of Treatment?: Also I have been off work for a month but mine is in my face and ear. I have hearing damage and facial nerve damage from it. Take this very seriously You have to advocate for yourself
13153,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I got it at around 42. It sucked hard. I still have scars 12 years later. The vaccine was not offered to me until I was 50. After getting shingles in my 40s I got the shots or the first one anyway but insurance would not cover it so it was 300 out of my own pocket. Since I turned 50 I got both Shingrix shots. They were free since I was over 50.
13154,I guess well just ignore all the infants who pass away from RSV every year: Nextdoor neighbor was 16 when he had his son and only 21 when he was told either the doctors remove his 5yearold's dead lung thanks to RSV or he will likely die. They both survived but it is been over a decade and neither have fully recovered. I have been terrified of RSV ever since. My youngest was able to be vaccinated for it but my eldest was just over the age limit when the vaccine was released. If I could just pay for it to get it I would. For every person who treats it lightly I want to show them the stunted twisted body of a onelung 90lb teenage boy and tell me if their crunchy mom points are fucking worth it.
13156,What factors to be considered for HPV vaccine at 29 ?: By consult with your obgyn they mean that the guidelines are that by the age of 26 any sexually active person would have been exposed to HPV hence the vaccine would be less effective. Insurance now covers up to 46 and some obgyn say that vaccination still helps. But if you do not have insurance then you have to do a little more soul and pocket searching. I got vaccinated one day before I turned 46  insurance covered  and I still showed up HPV for the first time in my life two years later...
13157,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Ill schedule mine before a weekend in case I feel crappy No to dementia
13162,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah. My mom was a nurse. I got a chicken pox party. When I was 17 or 18 senior in HS.... I was in health occ. Got shingles in the back of my head down my neck and ending on the front n back of my left shoulder. Looked like poison ivy. The big clue was I had pain I referred to as ''felt like my head was curbstomped flat'' at worst but had a burning sensation when it eased up. My mom did not believe it was shingles til i came home with a script for vicodin. I am 30 and still have some nerve damage from it. Better than it was though.
13169,Sores on scalp: Hi. We might be in the same boat. Had shingles approx 2 months ago too I also have sores on my scalp that sound somewhat similar to yours... Maybe with some differences though. Mine started somewhat before shingles but got significantly worse post shingles. They are small clusters of sores. When I itch them they can bleed and scab over. But no sharp shingles pain maybe that is where we differ?. The rest of my scalp also itches. Some days are better some days are worse. Right now they are on my hair line in the back of my neck but they have essentially been all over my scalp. When the sores develop I lose hair in that area. Oh and the itching sores are better immediately after I wash my hair and worse the dirtier my hair is. I tried to change shampoos conditioners pillow cases and serums. Yeah I tried all that stuff. What ended up working was going to my PCP and getting a derm consult. Here is what they said I copied it from my doctor note Counsel patient that seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis are both chronic problems without onetime curative treatment especially common in the immunocompromised population. Goal of management is to minimize the frequency and severity of flares. I also got two prescriptions for two shampoos and one over the counter shampoo ketoconazole 2 shampoo flucinonide solution prescriptions and Neutrogena TGel over the counter shampoo My advice regret I regret spending all that time and money trying to treat myself. I wish I would have gone to the doctor first and got that derm consult sooner. Might have saved some hair too. Hope this helps Also shingles can be on both sides of the body. That is what I had. It was disseminated and I had to be hospitalized. FYI if the sores are shingles like pain... Mine was all up my left and right legs .
13172,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: Like any vaccine there are side effects. Worse for some. I Have has the shingles vaccine. I do not remember it being worse that a Covid vaccine but whatever the side effect it sure beats getting shingles. My FIL got it in his eye and it ruined the last years of his life. Shingles suck.
13174,Second Shingles Shot: I have had shingles twice. First out break was so fucking bad Like I could not function for months. Literally lasted almost a year. I had to learn to function in the worst pain I have ever had besides liver failure. Now every time I get a small rash I freak out. I have gotten the vaccine but still scarred from the outbreak. When I did get the shot I felt nothing. Not from 1 or 2. Maybe because I have had shingles? When I got chicken pox I was 24 and it almost killed me. I had sores on the inside of my eye lids nostrils hell even on my junk. All thanks to my ex wife.
13176,Bout of shingles after getting the shot?: I got my first case 2 weeks following 4th Covid booster. Ok for 6 mos. told doc about it and she said to get shingles vaccines. I did and got second case 2 weeks later and now I get shingles regularly. I do not know what to think.
13179,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Username checks out. Seriously though. Shingles is not something to fuck around with. An older friend of mine in her 70s mentioned that her husband who is in his 80s caught a particularly nasty case of shingles that left him blind in one eye due to the nerve damage. Do not want.
13180,First time shingles and scared: I am going through shingles now. The pain started last week. Six days ago the blisters appeared. It is a bad case but I am having no issues other than I want the blisters to pop and dry up
13183,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles at age 54 and at first it was just a weird rash in my side but the next day it felt like my side was on fire and pain was shooting down towards my leg. The pain lasted about a week. The Dr told me to use a Lidocaine cream and schedule the vaccine a couple of weeks later. I got the two shots and thankfully never got shingles again. That shit is no joke Get the shot.
13184,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yeah it is a kick in the nuts. But I was military for 22 years and had to get the anthrax shot. That mother is like getting hit in the arm with a baseball bat. Trust me shingle.is not joke but nothing compared to anthrax. Lucky I got out of the small pox shot that is probably the worst I know.
13185,First dose no response: I Have seen both and I do not expect to see results for 3045 days. I just want to make sure I get full effect in that time. Seems odd I Have had zero visible reaction on my arm. I know I should not do a pull dose on my first dose but I Am contemplating it.
13186,"What is the deal with Herpes blood test?: Hello Folks! I went and got a STD panel test to check myself just in case, all good. The clinic doesn't do blood test for herpes. I've never had any symptoms of herpes but I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and still want to know. I've been reading that the standard herpes blood test has a lot of false positives and that if you had chicken pox or shingles you are very likely to test positive even if you don't have herpes. What are your opinions on this? It appears that the University of Washington is the only place that has an highly accurate test, so I plan to do a blood draw and send it to them for testing. I know since I never had any symptoms this seems kind of neurotic but I want to be on the safe side"
13188,Got Mine and got shingles twice in 6 months. I will never get another vaccine
13189,Shingles at 35: 34 so just got you beat haha but fortunately my doctor was much better and put me on antivirals and pain meds after just a few days of relatively minor symptoms. The two days after I went to the doctor though were pretty brutal worst sustained pain I have ever had do not think I got more than a few minutes of sleep here and there one night but luckily the meds started working after that and it was uncomfortable but manageable.
13190,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same here I cannot remember how I felt but my mom was miserable while she had it. Sorry mom.
13191,My team member had shingles in June. Had to leave work for more than 1 month stayed in the hospital for medication for almost the same period. First thing that came to mind when she informed me about her diagnosis was the vaccine. She had Pfizer.
13195,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I was fine when I last got it and I Am about to get it again. It gave me peace of mind especially both son and now soon to come daughter are born in the rsv season. Like many others I Have also had the Covid t dap and flu shot and was perfectly fine outside of a sore arm for a day.
13199,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: It was horrible Got it in my eye and then lasting nerve pain
13201,"Rash on Left Breast: Age: 24 Sex: Female Height: 5' 4.5 Weight: 136 Race: Caucasian Duration: Approximately 2 weeks Location: US, Left Breast Existing Medical Issues: None Medical History: excision of ganglion cyst right wrist, excision of fibroadenoma left breast, excision of right posterior cervical lymph node. Muscle spasms in my left shoulder and neck about one month ago and pins and needle sensation in right shoulderblade. Mild insomnia, seasonal allergies. Acne since Mirena IUD was inserted in October 2014. Current medications: ambien, mirena IUD, clindamycin 1% gel [Photo of rash- NSFW](<url>) I noticed this pink area on my breast approximately two weeks ago. To be honest with you all (TMI), I thought that my husband just squeezed it too hard during sex. It popped up overnight. It is flat and just mildly pink- I think it looks darker in the picture than it does in real life. I had a fibroadenoma excised from this breast two years ago- you can see the scar on the top border of my nipple. It's not warm and the texture of my breast doesn't feel different. I have fairly sensitive skin, but I don't recall ever having a rash like this before. About a month ago, I went to Urgent Care with severe pain in my left shoulder and neck, and pins and needles sensation in my right shoulderblade. I was prescribed flexeril and norco for a week for muscle spasms- while I felt great taking them, I didn't have any relief of the spasms. I've actually been getting acupuncture (much more effective and no drugs!), but the tingling in my right shoulder blade remains. I'm actually wondering if this could be a really bizarre presentation of shingles? I had shingles once before, when I was 11, and I didn't have the classic blister rash then- although I don't remember what it looked like, it was on my back and chest. I'm probably reaching here, but I have been under an incredible amount of stress. I'm actually an RN, and trying to convince myself that I don't have inflammatory breast cancer. The lymph node in my neck was just removed in February, and my ENT and PCP were quite concerned about cancer then- it was a very stressful time, but it turned out to just be reactive. I am kind of"
13204,My first outbreak of shingles was at 17 now in my early 40s I Have had it 14 times. I was vaccinated a year ago and have had an outbreak since then.
13207,Be aware of shingles. Had a family member experience it right after a vaccination event that confused us.
13209,Shingles vaccine experience: My mom got shingles. This woman had 5 kids  had 2 knee replacements without pain killers afterward. Tough old French Canadian. Shingles messed her up so bad. I Have never seen her in so much discomfort
13213,Had the Shing rex vaccine series a year or so ago. I am on R in vo q I think I have shingles again. Ugh. Had it a few years ago before the vaccine Anyone gotten shingles after being vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated? Did you have to stop the UC meds during treatment? Hoping to get in to see a Dr tomorrow.
13217,Shingles and PHN Experience: My doctor told me I could take up to 300mg gabapentin 3x a day BUT she said if I did take that much to drop down to 200mg for a bit then 100mg to a bit. Definitely need to titrate Sadly the pain that felt like someone was kicking me in the kidney sort of like labor pains only occurred the days before the rash and before I got the gabapentin. Since then I have only taken it twice at night. I also did 800mg ibuprofen and that helped along with benadryl at night. I had 5 days of extreme skin pain and sensitivity followed by 2 days of deep internal pain plus skin sensitivity then the rash developed. AND I started on antivirals just 24 hours after my first symptoms of skin sensitivity because everything I was reading just said this is the start of classic shingles so I was lucky to start antivirals so soon and I think that is why my rash is not as bad. My rash does span all the way from my belly button and wraps around my torso all the way to my spine though but its not blistering or oozing.
13219,RSVP vaccine and others: I guess to answer your question no I am not worried about anti vaccine I worry about their children but there is nothing I can do about that. I will say that I am so glad I got vaccinated while pregnant. We just got over rsv. My 7 year old was in the hospital from severe dehydration and anorexia because it was that bad. My toddler who was vaccinated in March and my newborn who got the antibodies from me just had stuffy noses and a little cough.
13220,First shingles vaccine side effects: A week of flu like symptoms is better than the shingles. GL hope they end soon.
13221,Hello Moms Unfortunately my baby has gotten sick with rsv me and my husband have it too she was vaccinated for it when she was a newborn so her symptoms are not as severe. I am just hoping to hear from others about babies that were vaccinated and how they took it how to help etc. She only has somewhat of a cough and a bit of a runny nose. I have given tynenol as needed used the cupping method have the humidifier on high suctioned mucus and has had her snuza on 247 since diagnosis. Please no comments about the controversy behind these vaccines. TIA
13223,Got diagnosed with shingles and influenza A yesterday and I do not think I Have ever been so miserable. Not really looking for answers just thought maybe someone could empathize. I Am 25 and I have a pretty terrible immune system but I Have never experienced body aches like this. My fever got up to 103 and I can barely get out of bed. Does anyone have advice or encouraging words?
13226,20 F with shingles even though I was vaccinated and have never had chickenpox: I never had chicken pox and got the vaccine when it first came out in 1995 or 1996 when i was 12 or 13. I got shingles on my face and eye almost a year ago. worst pain ever inside my head behind my eyeball. not recommended 010. I ended up in urgent care and told the Dr that i never had chicken pox and i had the vaccine in 1995 and they basically did not believe me and said the vaccine came out way later than that whatever. i ended up with antiviral that helped a ton but took a long time for the sores to heal still have scarring on my forehead and my eyelid droops compared to the other side and my eyesight is blurry and the white of my eye is kind of gray not as white as my other eye or as white as it used to be. i should probably go to an ophthalmalogist cuz it really bothers me when i am tired and gets super blurry its probably too late now though and no insurance kind of sucks.
13228,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Yes they would have these parties when the kids were 35 before school so they would not miss any school. We had the experience of my FIL having shingles and the very painful episodes of neuralgia. He was miserable for months from the pain probably from his childhood chicken pox party 75 years before. My wife and I got the Shingrex vaccine as soon as we were able to hopefully avoid the painful shingles of an adult.
13231,27F 5'3 115lbs with no preexisting medical conditions and am pretty healthy and active I woke up on Tuesday morning with two long fluidfilled blisters on my left ear cartilage looks similar to this They only hurt when I touched them and overall did not because much pain. After googling a bunch I only found information on herpes zoster. I did have chicken pox when I was young and my immune system was recently down because I am recovering from my first experience with covid but I have no other symptoms of shingles other than fatigue which could also be from having covid recently. I have been checking my body for a rash too and there is nothing. I ended up going to urgent care that day and the doctor had no idea what it was until I showed him the image linked above. He said it was a herpes flareup and prescribed me a 7 day course of Valtrex. He also took a swab of my ear to test for HSV which came back negative the next day. Today is Friday and I have been taking the medication and my blisters are clearing up but I am just confused as to what this is and if it could happen again. Is this shingles? Is it possible to have shingles without any other symptoms?
13233,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes and I hate it. Also you can get them more than once. I had them twice as a kid and super bad both times. I have a lower immune system and nobody cared.
13238,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: The reaction to the shingles vaccine is brutal but it is still not as bad as what you are going through.
13241,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: A good friend of mine just got a terrible case 2 months shy of her 50th so yes its infuriating
13242,Because of shingles other than stress?: My case of shingles started the weeks after I had COVID.
13244,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I am so mad that my mom did not get me the vaccine and I got chicken pox instead. Now I have to worry about shingles
13246,Under 35 with Shingles?!!!: I just got diagnosed with Shingles a day after loosing my job of many years. 1) I had no idea someone so young can get shingles and 2)I just realized by reading through these comments that it's actually common. What did your doctors say about it? Should doctors be looking at our cases to reconsider the age to vaccinate for this? 3)how many of you had reoccurring shingles?! This doesn't seem normal to me.
13249,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Yeah I had no idea what was going on the last time. I thought it was toothache that was affecting my sinus. Then when the blinding headaches started my wife took me to an urgent care place since it was the weekend. Doctor diagnosed some rare and completely bullshit disease and prescribed steroids. Monday morning I called my regular doctor. He called me right back and said it sounded like shingles so I got the right treatment but my blood pressure was spiking and steroids were absolutely the wrong drug for that...
13250,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: Thank you for this. I am going to take 3000 mg of lys in e now. I have not had a breakout yet but I have swollen lymph nodes that hurt at my neck and jaw.
13253,"Shingles, contact dermatitis, or infection around my erythema nodosum biopsy site?: *Please keep in mind that this subreddit is not a replacement for seeing a board certified dermatologist. This subreddit is here for informal second opinions, and minor problems that you wouldn't go to the doctor for anyway.* *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/DermatologyQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
13255,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Yup. First was the worst second was not as bad I think it was easier because I cleared my schedule and was prepared
13256,I had a mild case of shingles in my scalp. Felt like someone was stabbing my head with a knife. Nurse at Dr's office said some people can barely tolerate clothes. GET THE VACCINE
13258,There Is NEVER been a real vaccine for the common cold or flu. Pharma has manufactured and distributed vials of injections that are labeled as being such but that has always been a scam. The flu vaccine triggered bouts of shingles in my family. Have refused ALL vaccines since
13260,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: Women are tough I was tough all right. I made it almost all the way home before I fainted on my front stoop. I would never have made it up the stairs but I was disappointed I could not remain conscious long enough to get inside.
13267,Shingles vaccine: Round 2 is not as bad. It is more like a mild hangover as opposed to Round 1 where you feel like death warmed over for 72 hours
13268,Antivirals making me feel like hot garbage: Valacyclovir gives me nausea and exhaustion but believe me it is better than not taking it and letting shingles run rampant. I really commiserate with your discomfort especially with the palpitations. My first time around I took Dramamine for the nausea but with later shingles I just do tea and crackers when it gets bad. Good luck with this I hope it does not impact your work situation too much. Take care of yourself
13271,Are you all aware or have taken a hpv vaccine?: Any side effects post vaccination? Like fever and all?
13276,Shingrix: Yes from what I ve gathered it s fairly common to feel run down flu like after the shot I m not concerned with that just wondering how long I ve been off prednisone since September and the tearing started in the last 3 months
13277,Cannot believe I now have shingles: I had it twice in less than a year during LC. Not the worst pain I have ever felt but it was certainly the most uncomfortable pain I have ever experienced. It is torturous and without relief. I took all the drugs offered there was no chance in hell I would risk postherpetic neuralgia. I have heard that described as a 'permanent tattoo of pain'.
13284,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My 26 weeker received it at 36 weeks. No side effects. Vaccine side effects did not outweigh the risk of RSV.
13285,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Had shingles at 48. Was misdiagnosed for the first two days. One of the three worst pains in my life right up there with 36 hours of unmedicated labor I tell everyone get yer damn shingles shot
13286,Shingles vaccine: I was fine after both of mine.
13291,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I had Gardasil 4 back in the 00s when it first came out. Got diagnosed with precancer and HPV a couple years ago after not getting a pap for 5 years. The gyn recommended I get Gardasil 9 and said anecdotally he sees patients do better when they take it even though technically it should only be preventative if you do not already have it. I asked why some people fight off HPV while others do not and he said some strains are better at hiding from the body than others. My NOT scientifically proven belief is that getting the vaccine shows your body how to recognize the virus so it will fight it off. Sure enough I was HPV free at my 6 month followup not necessarily about the vaccine alone but getting my cervix lasered and my partner took the vaccine as well for safety and he had problems he would had for years disappear shortly after his 2nd shot of 3. Little rashes that he was always told were yeast infection. Again this is just my own opinion and not medically condoned but I really believe we were passing HPV back and forth for years and the vaccine allowed both of us to get rid of it. Also no side effects at all from getting it  I highly recommend
13298,Did your parents make you go play with the kid who had chicken pox?: Good lord that would be miserable. I ve had shingles and had that alongside my right ribs. Thankfully without covid or something to cough. I m experienced with illness but that crap was painful and took extraordinary effort to not move to because all that at once and not itch myself. Thankfully it was gone in a week. Recently got my first shingles shot just so I will not get that again.
13304,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: And shingles hurts like hell. My husband had it on his back and was in abject misery. After he recovered he went around telling everybody he knew to get the shingles vaccine
13305,I Am home with shingles and I Am so miserable It broke out in my scalp I think on Thursday but it was just 2 weird lumps at the top of my scalp I honestly did not know what it was by Friday a rash was on my forehead and a tingle above my eye. I have had excema my whole life so I assumed it was that and put my excema scalp ointment on my scalp and forehead wrapped it up and went to sleep. I woke up Saturday to what looked like weird pimples in the rash and discomfort and tightness and knew it was not excema. I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with shingles and started on a high dose of Valtrex. My PCP is on vacation until Monday. The Urgent care doc checked my eye out and did a test and said it was fine but to watch it as my eye had begun to swell. By Monday morning my eye was swollen shut and urgent care sent me to an eye specialist. The docs were residents and I honestly think they were more interested in looking at it and the location than anything because more than one kept poking and prodding at my eye. I was actually getting upset because they numbed it up but kept squeezing it open with their hands. Of course I struggled back because it was extremely painful and uncomfortable despite the numbing which I think wore off by the time I saw the docs. I was given more meds told it was fine and sent home. when I got home my eye and forehead were oozing and bruised its been 2 days and my eye is finally reopening but the lid is swollen and tomato red I have swelling under my eye which is so uncomfortable. All the old lesions scabbed over but I do not think it was natural I think they all popped from all the pushing up and down on my eye. I looked online and it sounds like this is going to last at least 2 weeks. Now my ear is throbbing along with the lymph nodes around it being swollen tight. I Am getting headaches my eyelashes keep super gluing to my lid and now I Am seeing new little pimple like bumps still popping up I look hideous I just want to cry My questions  how long will all this swelling last in my face? how long until my eye looks normal again When will these lesionspimples stop?  when can I bandage cover this all up?  will any of this scar? Please help Update I entered to eye doc again this morning had eye evaluation and its still not in my eye which is good. I have a follow up appointment again next week. New problem. I noticed I Am barely blinking in the one eye I still have the ear pain outside my ear I cannot smile anymore and I Am having a hard time eating. Is this part of shingles? I tried to call a Neurologist but they did not have an appointment first 3 weeks. Should I go to an ER? Update 2  Woke up and went to the ER diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome now on Medrol taper with Gabapentin . Also started Lysine per suggestion below its official I hate life
13307,Got diagnosed for shingles today :( I'm only 19: oh no that's not good :( i hope your pain goes away and your skin gets better. thank you ??
13308,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Omg she got Shingles? Karma is a beeyotch
13309,RSV vaccine mid glucose tolerance test: I got 2 vaccines during my 1 hour test wait and I was over the threshold by about 30 pts. I failed my 3 hour spectacularly with multiple draws over 200. it was def GD
13311,Morning Ian Kitty and Unit . Hope you are ok ... partner got her second shingles vaccine Trying to scrape up the money for mine now. Sounds bloody awful
13312,I had one round of whatever that led to Shingles. At that time no one knew that Shingles could result from the spike protein or vaccine Not so fun time. Now I know what to do.
13313,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Not sure if its recommended but maybe even get it earlier. Apparently it can be brought on by stress. I and a guy I worked with both got it around the same crazy stressful time in the office. He was 39 and I was 41. Something I hope to never repeat.
13315,41 and got Shingles: I had shingles for the first time at 19. My blisterslesions were on my left side. I sang in a dinner theater at the time we were doing two shows a day and I had 9 costume changes in the show. These were very nice vintage dresses but a gown worn in the 30s is not soft anymore. It was so excruciating changing those gowns They prescribed Vicodin and Famvir. I did not really know what they were but I filled them. The pharmacist was young and hot I flirted so hard for those 5 minutes but nothin. Looking back he probably was not going to be interested in the girl who is there for herpes meds and pain pills. It was not my best look.
13320,Up down stay at dosage?: As shitty and painful as shingles are they may be a good thing in your case. Your body is shedding the virus which may have been triggered by an activated immune response. Its common for dormant viruses and even pain at the site of old injuries to flare when the immune system is activated. I experienced this when I had a series of intense acupuncture treatments for severe back pain and after the 3rd session developed shingles on my back at the site of the majority of my pain . While they were painful the back pain that had me nearly crippled at age 25 was gone. May be a good idea to stay at the LDN dose you are on until the shingles resolve.
13328,Got my first case of shingles after getting my rubella vaccine when I was a teenager.
13329,I had both Shingles shots took some ibuprofen after the shot and was fine both times
13330,Starting methotrexate and shingles vaccine: The shingles vaccines really knocked my socks off but preferred it to getting the shingles.
13333,Shingles vaccine: Had the vaccine essentially no pain my wife had a lot of pain not sure why the difference. No shingles yet 5 years later.
13335,Shingles vaccine: I was expecting to get slammed with a shingles vaccine reaction but I had zero side effects for either shot aside from a slightly sore arm and about 90 seconds of shivering. When the shivering started I thought oh boy here we go but then nothing.
13338,chicken pox 3 times shingles at 14: thank you for sharing you are the first person i have ever heard also having it 3 times. mine seemed to go from bad to mild though. i have a scar on the inner corner of my eyelid from my first case but by the last chicken pox fit i had my school nurse had thought i was being bitten or stung by bugs on the play ground because i itched it so bad but it will not as severe. i have always chalked it up to moving around because i learned in school that viruses can change or disguise themselves just a lil to get past our immune systems and figured i must have contracted different strains. that or my immune system is just not great because i was not healthy growing up. i have yet to get shingles again but i am pregnant now so ill definitely be on the look out and try to keep my stress down since apparently that is a trigger or could be.
13345,Getting two vaccines at once: FYI. I was not sick just a horrible flare triggered by the vaccines that was like 15 years ago. And it had happened several years in a row previously
13352,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: The job is pretty chill but I had the flu vaccine a few days earlier and hep B vaccine on the same day. I also took the vaccine covid vaccine about a week after the rash developed. I hope that did not make it worse. Do you think I should take Valacyclovir?
13357,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: Wait its only effective for 10 years? I took it at 26 and no doctor ever mentioned this to me. I Am divorced too and sexual active and had an irregular pap 2 years ago . It would have been nice to have avoided that.
13358,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I was a child who almost died of chickenpox this was probably 19791980. Hospitalized for weeks in isolated intensive care. My parents were literally told to come to say goodbye to me. While you CAN theoretically get shingles after the vaccine it is far less likely as well as being more likely to be less severe and not have lasting effects. My dad who initially got chickenpox from a 'chicken pox party' in the 50's where the neighborhood moms being told survival rates were higher the younger the kids got sick would deliberately expose their kids prevaccine has persistent postherpetic neuralgia from shingles at 72 with crippling pain that has utterly changed his life. Willful ignorance like this when we have so much verifiable information at our fingertips drives me nuts.
13361,41 and got Shingles: My little sister got it around that age too. It was in her scalp and spread down to her eye. She had to see a special optometrist and she had lesions around her eye. She said it was so painful one night because of the weight of her hair in that area.
13365,I got the shingles shot about 4 years ago with the only side effect being a sore shoulder.
13368,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Thank you for reminding me I moved my shoulder upper arm often for a few hours after both flu and covid vaccines and had much less pain than I expected. I totally forgot about doing that.
13372,RSV is on tap for Spouse but he said 'absolutely not' to timing it with covidflu. He never reacts to a covid or tetanus shot but I always feel crappy. But after our shingleflu combo experience he wants to be careful about timing for anything new.
13374,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Ask your own doctor I do not know enough to advise on that.
13375,"Do I need to continue valtrex?: Hello, thanks for the quick responses the other night regarding the rash on my eye. I went to urgent care, was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed valtrex to be started right away 1g, 3x a day. The side effects from the drug are worse than my side effects from shingles. I'm dizzy, nauseous and have diarrhea every time I take a pill. My rash is dry/scabby. do I still need to continue the medicine? Are joint pain and upper back pain symptoms of shingles? TIA!"
13377,I Am glad she could take the vaccine I have been plagued for gt2 years w follow on shingles about 2 weeks gt each SARS2. Excruciating PHN pain I cannot take any moreso all I can do is anti virals. Reinfected so back to square 1 REALLY hoping SQIgG helps my battered immune system
13380,Any tips on how to make shingrix less painful?: I hate T DAP. It hurts like hell but I know tetanus hurts worse
13381,Shingles vaccine experience: Hell Even a day of feeling kind of crappy and a low grade fever is better than getting shingles
13388,Suggested vaccine: I had shingles in my early twenties.. yeah I know what are the odds and I had chickenpox in my childhood as well.. If I were you I would not take a risk with the vaccines. Though my shingles felt like I was periodically stabbed in my right rib with a knife. It is a painful disease but still tolerable. If I recall correctly taking acyclovir in time can prevent the most painful symptoms. It took two weeks to get an appointment for me at that time so it was too late. A decade forward I still have blister scars.
13389,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My doc said that sometimes a fever or a yuck after a vaccine is administered is a sign that it IS working  it activated your immune system.
13395,Put me out of my misery.: Weirdly my second shingles dose did not hit me as bad as my first. Get well soon OP.
13397,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I had both vaccines and still got it. Cannot imagine what it might have been like if I had not had the vaccines
13398,Can someone help make sense of what is happening in my body?: Yes The hormonal changes in an aging female body... I keep forgetting about that. There are now some foods I cannot eat anymore since getting older. HIV or not there is something going on with my immune system. After reading some articles I think I need to get a test for that too. I cannot remember what mg of valacyclovir I was taking. It is been about 1.5y since getting the Shingrix and it all stopped. I have a prescription I will probably restart that regimen soon.
13400,Elaine was working in a hospital during the vaccine rollout and she got shingles. I think I was she would on She now takes regular doses of ivermectin.
13405,Had the second shingles shot: I felt pretty shitty for a few days. Lingering feeling of the residuals of a head cold or flu or something. Worth it to avoid shingles.
13406,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 81 and vaccinated. My mom drug me to several chicken pox parties as a kid but my immune system decided work of course than went to hell sometime in my early 20s
13407,In 2016 I was talked into getting a flu shot and a shingles shot Well of course I got shingles on my hand And the next thing you know I had the worst flu of my life Go figure
13408,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: My husband had a horrifying case of shingles. Even with getting the antivirals right away it was bad. His was brought on by sudden stressgrief. His brother died unexpectedly and that was the trigger. It got him all along his right side. His face arm torso even the groin area. Our province does not cover the cost of the vaccine and neither does private insurance. You must be 50  to get the vaccine but you have to pay 100 of the cost if you are under 65. He is in his early 60s but is going to wait until 65 to get it. I am younger than him but I said ef that shyte and paid the money for the two shots. I remember my mum having shingles a few times and she was in terrible pain with it. She got the first generation vaccine Zosterix? vaccine and paid  for it as soon as it was available. She never had another shingles outbreak for the rest of her life. So yeah I have seen my mother and my husband suffer terribly with shingles. My chances of getting it are about 1 in 3. I gladly paid the money. I felt rough after each shot but a few days of bleh is way better than a severe shingles outbreak.
13410,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I never got it because I had scarlet fever instead. Got the vaccine at 19 because I worked with kids at the time. Both my mom and brother have had shingles it is awful My mom had it on her face. Both stress induced.
13417,Shingles vaccine: Both my parents suffered with shingles twice each I knew I wanted the vaccine Yes my arm was sore but no other effects and I have not gotten shingles.
13419,Thought it was heat rash lol: That sounds awful! The fact it can go on the forehead is just too much. It's already bad enough but to have the ability to go into your eye is just unfair on top of everything else.
13420,I am at 4 months since onset rash was no big deal but the pain and continued PHN has been horrible. I am finally at a 'bearable pain level'. I definitely want the vaccine to hopefully not have it again. Those that have had multiple outbreaks did you get the vaccine? This is something I never want to experience again.
13421,I know 3 people that also got shingles after the Covid shot.
13423,mRNA future: My neighbour died 18 days after one Covid jab Remember Thalidomide? They insisted that was safe.
13425,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: Did Not get it but a coworker who is pregnant did and she had to go to the ER
13426,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Have you tried to get vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated? I currently have shingles at 43 and I assume I will need to pay out of pocket to get the vaccine but I still plan on trying to get the vaccine early. I am miserable right now and hope to not relive it even if it is unlikely.
13428,So I had shingles on my eyeball. It was painful but it left me with 'Trigeminal' neuralgia. This is also known as 'suicide disease'. It is called that because of how excruciatingly painful it is. Literally like electrical knives into your facial muscles. I started to get electrical knife stabbing pain throughout my entire left side. So the base form with just the face is considered one of the most painful conditions in all of medicine. Hence suicide disease. But this is multiple times worse than that. It hits muscles on my entire left side of my body crippling me. I am crippled now by this. My muscles are spastic and being struck by lightning by the increased glutamate. Glutamate increases electrical output that is what generates electrical signals in the neurons. So the combination of the two together makes it the mother of motherfuckers to fry your body in an electrical knife storm where they stab deeeeep into your muscles making you screaaaam literally like someone just stabbed you for real. I went to the neurologist and they would not medicate me. They did not know what was wrong by the symptoms. Electrical knife stabbing to left side the side of herpes zoster opthalmicus. But they were too stupid to figure it out. They left me in agony absolute agony screaming all day and all night. Sleeping in agony after a couple days had passed and I passed out from exhaustion. My girl friend said I was screaming in my sleep in pain. But still sleeping. This went on for over a year. It broke my mind into something different than I was. I stare into nothingness now. I could not think but I had to save myself. I researched while in severe pain and thought this could be related to the obvious post herpetic 'trigeminal' neuralgia. I saw it was treated with Gabapentinoids for one. I learned you could get that for anxiety. So I set an appointment with psychiatric nurse and told her I had anxiety. I asked for Gabapentin at that time I should have asked for Pregabalin but I had to figure it out. She prescribed and after the very first dose my pain went down by about one third. Now they will not increase dosage and since it was not for my condition I had to figure out how to get the proper dosage. So I ended up having to get it from a mexican pharmacy. I added this to my dosage and my pain was not as absolutely horrific as it was. I could not believe it. I then was referred to a pain physician and she prescribed me Pregabalin the newer form. I could not get that from mexico really because of the cost. It had even greater effect on the insane pain. However this still is not the main treatment for 'trigeminal' neuralgia. I have been trying to get treated for about two and half years. That is 2.5 years with suicide disease and doctors cannot handle this in this amount of time with such obvious symptoms. I do have Pregabalin but I am still crippled by this. I have spasticity and knife stabs all the time. Less than before by far but I feel quite sure most people would have offed themselves by now with this shit. The glutamate disorder is a whole nother bag I will not go into but that is a huge deal also. It is powering this neuralgia I believe through nerve crosstalk which allows it to traverse nerves and not be mired in a single root. Anyways it is really horrible and I am crippled and in severe pain.
13433,Should we get our baby the RSV vaccine?: Just left the hospital with my 14 week baby recovering from RSV. It is terrifying. Get the shot. Mine got hers as we checked out. Watching your baby struggle to breathe for days is hell.
13439,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got mine a few years ago. I do not remember any side effects beyond the sore arm. Good luck
13446,Vaccine?: TY having MS is enough of a challenge without shingles. I hope Shingrix keeps me from bout number 4 3 nearly did me in.
13452,The shingles vaccine sucks.: My shingles felt real itchy and stingy right in the middle of my back. I was only 17 also.
13455,I hope you are feeling better. Shingles sucks I had a dose in December
13456,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Thanks its random right and I got it in a large nerve and it caused damage. I Am just unlucky.
13457,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I just got over my 10th maybe 12th bout of internal shingles in 6 years and waking up this last time the first day exhaustion was the first symptom then it slowly turned into what felt like I had the flu.. then the electric shocks began face nerve pain tingling headache earache and sores on my gum line.. I continued to feel exhausted for seven days while taking my antivirals.. I Am so sorry that your doctor does not seem to hear you or believe you.. but I think that we all do hang in there rest as much as possible and stay hydrated
13458,Starting on methotrexate. Any tipsadvice?: Make sure you are vaccinated against shingles first. Shin gri x vaccine Edit to add I had hallucinations extremely weird dreams from MT X for the first 3 or 4 dose. After that things got better.
13460,If you had any vaccination while on a biologic which did you have and what was your experience?: I got that one last year 2 shots while on Stelara 90mg inj 90 days. I tend to have strong immune reactions to vaccines and was told the shingles vaccine is sort of known for that. Having your immune system respond appropriately to the vaccine so you are primed for infection exposure is the point. Biologics may dampen that response with live vaccines but should not have any impact on all other vaccines. I have had multiple COVID vaccines MMR pneumonia flu shingles HepB and more while on Stelara Cosentyx Talz Remicade Humira Enbrel etc. I have been on biologics since 2006. Your rheumatologist should provide guidance on timing vaccines with your biologic. Live vaccines are discouraged while on biologics because of the potential to not get appropriate immune response but lower immunity is still better than no immunity. I have had shingles and it is horrible with potential for permanent nerve pain damage.
13463,Shingles vaccine question: Just got my first yesterday I feel fine.
13467,Shingles Sucks: I have got fibro. My first shingles episode was in my mid30s. The worst was around 41 I got into some poison ivy and it caused shingles to break out with it because I am so allergic. I should have been in the hospital but single mom and no insurance at the time. I suffered for weeks. I could only sleep a little and only because I was naked and under a wet cotton sheet. It helped. Every time I get stressed I break out in shingles. I do not know if I can have the vaccine at this point. I do encourage everyone to get it that can. Shingles sucks a rotten hobo dick. Edit spelling
13469,"2nd Bout of Mild Shingles in 3 months but reaction to Valtrex this time?: That is a nonsensical comparison. Like apples and cars. But do you. Compassion fatigue has kicked in for anyone who works that hard to twist someone else's very clear words. You're trying to co-opt their experience to prove your own biases correct. I won't argue with your cognitive dissonance. The person had chronic shingles that, according to you, coincidentally happened to go in remission for three years after getting vaccinated, before returning. It was a total coincidence. Cool. Roll with that."
13473,New upper backneck pain and nausea: Yeah classic flare for me but with some fun new aspects. I was initially concerned about shingles because my wifes case started with upper back pain but I Am confident now that this is just my home grown autoimmune assault on myself. I Have been unmanaged for so long that the break I Have had for the past month or so made it different to interpret this time around. I Am starting on sulfasalazine to complement the Simponi but I will never again touch methotrexate did that once and it was a march through hell. Thanks for the insights
13475,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I had shingles last year that resulted in damage to my eye not blind it that eye though so that is good. I describe shingles as a demon lying in wait in your nerves just getting ready to attack you when you are at your weakest. It is fucked up.
13482,Shingles vaccine: I go for my first shingles shot on Friday. My wife has had both shots and although neither made her sick she said her arm hurt a lot. Even more than her covid shot.
13484,I had shingles.. take the vaccine
13485,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Hey She use to be on the Lyricist Lounge back in the day. Damn she fell on hard times.
13486,"Redoing MMR shots?: Hi, looking for some advice. Our son was scheduled to have his MMR/Hep A and Varicella vaccines once he turned 12 months old. Due to a family emergency we had to travel internationally prior to that and his pediatrician gave him the shots when he was 11 months and 2 weeks old. At his 18 month checkup (with another pediatrician from the same office), the pediatrician said we would have to redo his 12 month vaccination as per the CDC, they ""count"" only if taken within 5 days of his first birthday and that it would cause issues later when we enroll him in the public school system. I took a look at the CDC website and it does mention >Infants who get one dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should get two more doses (one dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose separated by at least 28 days). We're a bit worried about putting him through so many vaccines and were wondering if anyone has been through this before."
13488,Shingles vaccine experience: I just turned 37 so not GenX BUT I did have a wicked shingles case back in August and if ANYONE is on the fence about getting vaccinated fucking do it. I spent almost three weeks with horrific pain radiating all over and I still have pain where the shingles rash was. While me getting it so young is kind of rare if you can avoid it and you do not take the steps to do so you will 10000000 regret that choice. So just get the vaccine and be grateful that you have some protection against a 10000010 awful experience.
13492,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My baby got it at her immediate appointment at 5 days old or so. We noticed absolutely no side effects and I am so grateful and happy to have gotten it for her because supply is so low.
13494,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: I have twin daughters who have a best friend. The best friend got the HPV vaccine and is now a type two diabetic for the rest of her life. When her mom read the potential side effects it sure was there.
13495,Shingles and other Vaccines: Yes I Have gotten sick from those vaccines but it only lasts a day or two which is a good trade off when I think about the two relatives I lost to Covid and the hospice patient my mom had who got shingles on her face and headed for her eye shingles had nothing to do with her being in hospicethat was true suffering. Now that the shingles shots and illness are behind me I never have to worry about that for life. Ill take it.
13498,Had the second shingles shot: Shot did not work for me. Still got shingles.
13499,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had shingles when I was 14 because puberty was not enough suffering apparently. I had chicken pox as a kid even though I was vaccinated. My fiance just had shingles for the first time recently he is 27 and never had chicken pox and got the chicken pox vaccine. I think it is just kind of a crap shoot as to if you are going to get it or not and the best thing you can do other than get the shingles vaccine once your doc will let you is be aware of what shingles presents as so you can catch it as early as possible to start antivirals to slow down the spread. If you have what look like multiple bug bites that look like they are in a pretty straight line call your primary care AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to get seen
13501,Diagnosed today.: I also have post herpetic neuralgia after a bout of Shingles 4 years ago. My doctor said I would have the pain for the rest of my life Yikes Not what I wanted to hear I am over sixty and do not want to waste my final years in pain like this I found a Neurologist that would do a nerve block to turn off those nerves that would not stop firing causing me to feel such pain Hopefully he will bring me some relief GOOD LUCK to youyou are not alone disappointedface
13502,Vaccines and Humira?: I had shinglesits awful Get the newer vaccine
13507,Shingles vaccine: I have had shingles twice. I could not get the old shingles vaccine because of cancer history. When they offered the 2 shot vaccine I burned rubber getting it. Nothing much is worse than shingles.
13508,Shingles vaccine: I Have done flu  Covid together and Covid  Shingrix but never all three. I generally feelfelt blargh but not super sick after all but I Am not sure Id be brave enough to risk all three at once LOL.
13509,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember hearing about it. I had three siblings at the time I contracted it from one of them so my mom did not need to send us away from one we just all caught it from each other. And I can sympathize with the shingles my sister ended up developing a case and I received a break out as well just after I got out of the hospital for a severe infection. It was definitely very painful but luckily only lasted for about a week in my case.
13511,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: 5 years now. I got electrocautery done 1 year after they appeared. They went away and came back. Since the last 3 years there has not been newer warts but the ones which came back remained.
13513,I had shingles on and off for 13 years but since I had the vaccine I Have been free of it. Its really worth having even if you have had it you can get it again
13521,I have had a weird rash patch on my neck for the last week or two. It does not hurt does not itch has not spread very much and blanches when pressed. it is raised a bit but no hives or pustules. Is this a boring rash or a rash that needs attention? Medical history 36F JIA PCOS Endometriosis Migraines GAD Meds Enbrel hydroxychloroquine Lexapro Amitriptyline propranolol Slynd Maxalt MLT Robaxin semaglutide Zyrtec I have had both shingles vaccines and am up to date with covid booster and TDAP. Pictures x200B
13522,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had chicken pox with a side of scarlet fever when I was 6 which left me with delightful scars all over my body. Shingles would be a goddamn insult after spending 4 weeks in the hospital with this mess the first time
13523,Good thinking 99. 6 years ago my dr gave me a script for the vaccine high risk group. At the time there was a shortage of the vaccine and I was on a wait list. A few weeks later I was hit with shingles and received a text saying my vaccine was now available
13526,Shingles but never had chickenpox?: The culture was positive and I saw my ophthalmologist the day after I saw my dermatologist. Thankfully I got the antiviral in time because my ophthalmologist said it was getting very close to my eye. All of the blisters have disappeared and there is just some redness where the rash was. Very frustrating though. Should I talk to my doctors about getting the shingles vaccine?
13527,Hell lo 26 f Ulcerative colitis patient. I ve been on hum ira since 92022 with great relief of my UC symptoms. I met with my new GI and he realized I was missing a ton of maintenance things MRI Dex a s can s hring r ix prev nar shots he p a shot I took my hum ira last Friday 616 and got the shin gri x today 620 I feel like dog s ht chills body aches no appetite etc how long should this last? Also anyone have any issues with skin tearing?
13529,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My mom had shingles on her face and in her hair. The pain was excruciating and she could not wear her glasses so she could barely see. She was one of the unlucky ones who have residual pain it never went away with scabs
13530,Getting RSV shot during pregnancy? Triple check they give you the right one.: Yes check and triple check the vaccine name I am so sorry OP. This happened to me as well and I was the one who found the error. The provider tried to cover it up which made the whole situation 10x worse. I was terrified of early labor or side effects but if it makes you feel any better I ended up going into labor at 402 and my 4 month old baby and I are healthy as far as I can tell.
13532,I remember seeing a lot of commercials about shingles after the vaccine
13534,Shingles vaccine question: I have had both shots. I was fine. Just a little soreness where I got the shot.
13535,Pharmacist Printed this 4 me: I was coming off of gabapentin and its issues. I am not sure how much I heard about sides from Cymbalta. My mistake was for not checking that i was prescribed something equally as bad. There were so many things happening in my life and right around me hence the Shingles.
13537,Shingles vaccine experience: My mum was too and when I got shingles it affected my eye so I got the vaccine as soon as I could eye fine I caught it early and took meds but protect that other eye and learn the early symptoms of infection. I was 42 and had to fight the medical clinic to get seen. I knew I had it but had only one blister on my eyebrow but knew my symptoms were highly suspicious. The doc checked my scalp and found more and confirmed the diagnosis and sent me to an ophthalmologist. If I did not already know the signs I would have had a much worse case by the time I thought I needed to be seen. In my case I worked for years as a medical assistant in a family practice and learned enough from patients calling in with very mild symptoms and the doctors saying oh that might be shingles they better come in. What I remembered the most is that chicken pox will affect both left and right sides of the body but shingles is always only one side not both. A prodrome will start where a patient might complain about numbness tingling or tickling before it gets to the burning stabbing pain and itching stage and that vesicles are normally small and have clear fluid in them but might be red bumps before this later becoming cloudy and crusting up. So I was having a weird sensation on my eyebrow and had developed a few tiny blisters. I then realized that it was tingling and a little numb but not at the same time running in a line like something had dripped on my face. I was not feeling great and checked my temp then called the clinic. The doctor praised me for knowing to be seen and said most people would not have been that smart to get in but that I probably saved my eye by starting the antivirals right away. I have a scar on my eyebrow I can live with it. You only have one eye so thought you might want to know these things just in case.
13539,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in '89 and got it twice from the kids my mom babysat. I now have an autoimmune condition that causes me to get shingles once or twice a year I have gotten them every year since age 22. Shingles suck ASS. I have permanent neuropathy from it on my right side. I am so glad my kids will never have to deal with it.
13541,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: The stress of the darkest days of covid gave me shingles but I was diagnosed over video. I definitely have post herpetic neuralgia on my ribs. It tingles in a bad way randomly. Ok did not think I would share that with the entire Internet. But we are in it together. I am 44. Got it at 42. Ouchy burn buzz.
13544,If you think the vaccine is bad. Do Not take it and see what happens. I work with someone who got shingles. Hes been miserable for months. Oh yeah. The second one was worse.
13547,Got menopause? You may be due for your shingles vaccine: I got a minor case of shingles 2 months after turning 50 even though it was a minor case I felt like I had been hit by a truck had them in my ear neck and face. Definitely getting the vaccine as soon as I have a 3 day weekend.
13556,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had shingles in my late 20s. Take my word, I would not complain about being tired or sore for a couple days. I had shingles reoccurring for a year. Nerve pain and itching from shingles lasts YEARS. You can also have permanent scaring from the lesions. You're almost guaranteed to get a reoccurrence of shingles if you have had chickenpox. And most of us had chickenpox parties when we were kids."
13559,Should i still get it?: that is crazy. i remember getting it in college and it was completely covered by insurance. also yeah i still got HPV but its CIN1 with low grade changes or something like that. i got a colposcopy in march
13560,Shingrix: Interesting that this quote is about GB S. Guill ian Barre Syndrome. It s listed as a side effect on something like 8 vaccine vaccines. I personally know 4 people who ve suffered from it and three had pretty serious paralysis for months up to one year. The CDC claims it only affects 1 100000 people and mostly happens in the wild. My experience is that they re lying through their teeth.
13562,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Just a side note yes babies died quiet regularly from things like chicken pox shingles and other things then the vaccines were invented and that mostly stopped. But now that the death rates have gone down significantly such people romanticise the 'good old times' where people did not need such medicine to be healthy but notably only those who already were vaccinated. You will never hear such nonsense from immigrants from countries were those vaccines are still unabailable because those people have seen their neighbours grieve when a baby died from such diseases. It is a sign of absolute stupidity they got the vaccination before they even can remember often during times where you were vaccinated in preschool and that is the reason why they never got linfected. But now they argue since they never got infected they did not need the vaccine. When I was a child I had an allergic reaction to one of the base ingredients in vaccines. A trace chemical that is used to carry the active ingredient. So I could not be vaccinated and I got measles German measles and eventually chicken pox and evey time the feaver and outbreaks go so bad my mom feared I would die. High feaver is especially dangerous for little kids and can easily kill them and all of those children's illnesses have a high risk of feaver. All three of those infections can stunt growth and eaven because physical disabilities. They are very dangerous. Especially at the age when the kid is too young for the vaccines. The reason why babies cannot be vaccinated at birth is because their immune system cannot handle it. And a vaccine is much milder than the actual virus. The virus will wreak havoc on their underdeveloped immune system. And just another note shingles are extremely dangerous for little babies. It attacks the brain when a baby gets infected. It is the number one because of death when caretakers are not careful enough. If mommy dearest has shingles and with her recless behaviour and the child already sick OOP should immediately go to her pediatrician and have her daughter checked.
13570,"Just received my HPV vaccine to protect myself from certain types of cancers. I'm in my early 20s and want to take proactive steps for my health. However, the side effects hit me harder than I anticipated. I had nausea, fatigue, and a sore arm for a few days after the vaccination. It was a challenging experience, but knowing that I'm reducing my risk of cancer keeps me motivated. Despite the temporary discomfort, I'm grateful for the protection the vaccine offers me."
13571,Shingles vaccine: The first shot was painful but I had no issues other than a sore arm for a few days. The second shot was fine. My mother had singles and said it was torture. I decided I did not want to experience it myself.
13572,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yeah, I'd much rather have a few day of feeling crummy than a case of full blown shingles"
13583,Hi everyone I Have been having this rash underneath my right breast. It popped up exactly a week ago and I noticed it after I tanned so I initially assumed it was a heat rash but it has not gone away. In the last couple days I Have also noticed rashes? forming on my right side. I do not know if this correlates but I Have also been experiencing sharp pains on that same side where the rash is. I thought it was due to my cannabis consumption but I stopped and I still experience it. I Have been putting 1 hydrocortisone cream on it and I think its helping. Is this shingles? Or what other rash could this be? Thanks in advance for your help.
13586,Put me out of my misery.: I have had both. Shingles were way worse than the shot. Measure your risk to the reward....
13589,I got shingles on my face 2 months ago. The rash was bad had my eye swollen shutbut never actually damaged my vision. The rash went down and I tried to go back to work. By the 2nd day I started having really bad light sensitivity. I went home from work and that is when the real pain began. I got PHN postherpetic neuralgia. I would have an attack every 45 minutes that would last about 5 minutes a piece. I mean it when I say I have NEVER experienced pain like this. It was the same sensation you get when you get a burn but like someone was inserting a scalding hot object into my eye socket and holding it there for 5 minutes. By day 5 I had not slept because the moment I would fall asleep I would wake up to that and I was literally afraid to fall asleep. I am not a person who is dramatic about pain or anything like that. I am an ex marine and I have a physical job where I get cuts bumps burns and injuries. I know people have strong opinions about vaccines but I seriously recommend getting a shingles vaccination just to avoid PHN. My face is still numb on the one side but I do not have the attacks anymore and I am back to work. Just seriously get the vaccine you do not want anything to do with it
13592,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel better I never had the chickenpox just vaccinated for it and at 30 I had the shingles after fighting a serious covid infection for a month. It sucked lol. My mom did try to sent me to one of those parties too but did not end up working.
13593,Is anyone tracking breakthrough infections of the Shingrix vaccine?: I know a 58 yr old immuno competent more or less female who has had 68 tiny patches of itchy vesicles over 5 or 6 der mato mes in the months following her Shin gri x 1. No prior Hx of shingles. No Tz ank or PCR has been done to confirm the Dx. She also had a sudden outbreak of latent chronic HSV 2 within a week of Shin gri x 1. Although she is ' immuno competent ' I have to wonder if she does not have some particular derangement of the immune system. Edit non contiguous bilateral.
13597,WHAT TO DO WHEN SHINGLES STRIKE: Do not wait to go to Urgent Care like I did and get on antivirals stat Shingles started on the back of my scalp and I assumed it was a rash from my shampoo. I waited 3 days before going to Urgent Care. Then on top of that there was a 2day delay by my pharmacy to get antivirals. Now I may have PHN a possible result of not taking AV's promptly.
13603,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: You are less likely to have shingles if you got immunity via vaccination rather than natural infection. I was born too late for the vaccine and had the disease. It was a horrific experience not a mild case. I was sick for 3 weeks. I had pox down my throat. Fevers with delirium. I really cannot even describe accurately how bad I felt. I have a little facial scar that I Have seen on a lot of people who had chicken pox a little dent on the forehead. Its too easy to scratch there and GOD the itching. I am going to be first in line for that shingles vaccine. And you can be damn sure my kids got vaccinated for pox.
13605,41 and got Shingles: My husband got them a few years ago at 48 right after he got over a pretty mild case of Covid he was fully vaccinated. It was ocular and mostly affected his right eye and right side of his face. Thankfully caught it early but he was still in a ton of pain.
13607,Shingles vaccine experience: I have heard more than a few stories of people getting shingles just after getting the shot. Any reason why this would happen ? And why it seems so common from stories I have read both on reddit and heard from other people I know.
13608,Shingles vaccine: I was late 50s early 60s and I did not have any problems when I got my Shingrex vaccinations. No side effects no illness just a mildly sore arm for a short time.
13609,I did not have that with either of the Shingles vaccine injections. However everyone reacts differently to such when they get them. Dr. Fauci had said one of the Covid shots had knocked him down for a couple of days. I have occasionally gotten cold symptoms but mostly I get none.
13610,RSVP vaccine and others: It really is smh. Keep us posted on how the RSV vaccine goes I get mine at my next appointment and I have heard your arm can be pretty sore after so I am definitely not looking forward to that lol
13612,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got shingles 3 years ago and got so lucky. A lil itchy rash on my back and that was it. At my last yearly my new doc was like you might be out of date on... I am like you can stop right there chief. Line them up. How many can we do right now. I do not fuck around with that shit. I live with my MIL who cannot walk and wears giant braces on her legs from polio. Not trying to catch some bullshit in 2025.
13615,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: NAD This sounds looks like shingles my husband had it and yes it shows up along nerves not necessarily at injection site. Maybe your chickenpox test was false negative and the injection caused a shingles outbreak. When my husband had shingles a couple of years ago the rash stuck around for about a month with 12 weeks of painful burning. He did not get an antiviral to shorten the duration.
13616,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I 31F had chicken pox as a child not sure if it was from a party or not and am currently getting over Shingles. Fortunately mine was not severe but the rash was very painful and my left side felt like I had a bad sunburn for a few days. Thankfully my kids are vaccinated against Varicella
13618,RSV shot: My baby got it the day after he was born in November. Hes 10 weeks old now and I have zero regrets of him getting it. Any protection against Rsv for a baby is worth it.
13621,Shingles vaccine: I have only had the first one and my arm was really sore but otherwise no other side effects. I know 2 people who got shingles and it was horrible.
13622,Shingles at 35: I am soo sorry It is really painful. I just had it start up a month ago i am 34 but I am reading this and other stories and realizing I am REALLY LUCKY. Mine got no bigger than a 50 cent piece and was really painful. Shooting pains in the back but none of the other stuff you stated. I cannot even imagine the pain for people when it gets large or even on the face. This may be because I already have HSV2 and have valocyclavir on hand and on the 2nd day of tingling when it looked like a little bug bite I started taking it thinking it was just my HSV outbreak in a really unusual place. I hope you get much relief soon. It is not fun but you have got this
13623,"Got shingles once again, caught it early this time: Two or three weeks ago I started noticing a little red spot on my abdomen and I really thought it was a bug bite or an allergic reaction, since I do wear crop tops very often. But then I noticed it started getting bigger, redder and more swollen, and it started to look very similar to the blisters I got the first time I got shingles nine months ago. The final straw was when i started getting a burning sensation in that area. So today I went to get it checked out and yes, it's shingles once again. Its weird how little time has passed between both times but to be fair I've been extremely stressed and my immune system is fucked up. But I have medicine and ointment now and I hope it doesn't get worse from here."
13624,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I have not had shingles yet but I Have seen things. A coworker had it on her face near her eye. The very first case I saw was one of our hospice patients living in an Assisted Living Facility. It was all red with tiny blisters and she was crying in pain. I felt so bad for her. I took a picture and the dr diagnosed it. I know she got pain med and I think an antiviral? Anyway I do not ever want shingles Guess I need to go down the rabbit hole to what my odds are lol
13626,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: '82 chicken pox party. Lots of people in my family have Shingles after having chicken pox. Oh and I have a few little scars DON'SCRATCH My kids have the vaccine for chicken pox so hopefully it will keep them and Shingles away.
13627,Essential T cells: My kid got GuillainBarre after second pfizer shot
13630,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Me too. When I get sick its usually bad. But this is not fun.
13632,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I felt the same way. It was so painful that I lay in bed whimpering. After 6 weeks of awful pain I got Botox injections into the affected area and the next day I was off pain meds.
13640,Bout of shingles after getting the shot?: Once shingles has activated getting it to go dormant again is apparently really hard for some people. I am apparently some people. I just keep breaking out in different spots. So I Have gone on long term Valtrex for now maybe for a couple of years to see if the break outs will stop. I cannot handle much more nerve damage to my body honestly.
13641,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: The improv sign in the background really confused people
13643,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am only 31 and had shingles it was horrible.
13647,Baby RSV Shot: Mine got her RSV shot at 4 weeks and independent of any other shots. She maybe took an extra nap that day but saw no other side effects
13648,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Do not blame your parents for getting shingles. Going to those parties was the only way for children to get lifelong immunity from what were sometimes lifethreatening diseases chicken pox measles German measles etc. The chicken pox vaccine came out in 1995 and the shingles vaccine in 2006. That is not very long ago. Sometimes life just sucks. I have had chicken pox and shingles and it sucked but not as bad as polio sucked. My husband contracted polio at age 2 before there was a vaccine and it took 12 years and multiple surgeries and trips to hospitals all across the country to cure him. It stole his entire childhood. All he remembers of childhood is the constant pain. So be thankful all you had was shingles. It could have been a whole lot worse.
13650,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: You have clearly never had shingles and your ignorance is deafening. It is not a tingling and a painful feeling. It is pain. Pain so merciless that there are times you will debate if removing the body part would be preferable just to make it stop. But it will go on for a few weeks like that. Not many around you will understand because it just looks like a rash but everywhere under that rash burning needles are being jabbed into every damn nerve you have. I have experienced this and will happily take another vaccination to make sure I do not again.
13652,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: Two doses separated by 26 months. Guessing the odds of getting it during the inbetween times is pretty low.
13654,Had the second shingles shot: Yep 102 deg F next day. Glad I happen to get the first on a Friday otherwise I would have missed 2 days work. I was hesitant on returning for the 2nd but no issues then.
13660,Shingles and other Vaccines: I know several people who have had shingles and they all would say avoid it if you can. The shingles vaccine definitely hit me the hardest of all my vaccines but its better than getting shingles.
13665,"Starting Humira, anything else I need to do?: AS with pain that radiates to hips, switching from Celebrex to Humira. Blood work is clear to start, doc said to get Prevnar vaccine. Anything else I should be doing? i.e. any vitamins to take to decrease risk of infections? I got the pfizer covid vaccine, but still wear mask at indoor stores and what not. Any other precautions to take to try to stay away from any of the side effects/risks? Thanks!"
13666,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I cannot praise this vaccine enough I procrastinated when it first came out and contracted HPV in my early 30swith the new research my OBGYN advised I could still take it. For 4 years I continued to test positive within a year after having the 3 doses my immune system took care of it and finally tested negative after years of anxiety of it tuning into cervical cancer
13667,Not trying to scare you off but of the thousands of shots I have had in my life the shingles vaccine was the absolute worst. And just when you get over the first one it is time for the second and that is just as bad.
13669,First Time w Shingles really struggling: You Are very welcome for the feedback. I hope you heal quickly. Shingles pain is awful. I tried Tylenol once during my first week with shingles did not do squat for me so I went back to Advil for the antiinflammatory effect. Every body is different use whatever works best for you. Great to hear that straight prednisone does not bother you. I took it twice many years ago and both times it made me so anxious that I broke down in tears. I knew another guy 20 years ago who ended up in a psych unit for a week while on prednisone once it wore off docs realized it was an adverse reaction to the steroid. So again every body is different do what works best for you. I Am so glad to hear that you will be starting 5 days of prednisone soon. This should have a very positive effect on the inflammation and pain level. Definitely give the ice packs a try and see how they work. Maybe wrap them in a thin tea towel if they feel too cold on your face. Cold compresses are great too. I made the mistake of trying a heating pad on my flank 20 min later I thought I was going to die. lol. I learned the hard way for shingles do cold not heat. lol
13671,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I would stay away from mRNA vaccines but you really need the rest. You are 23 and as an adult can get all your vaccinations. Talk to your doctor. There probably is not much that you can do to sway your mother.
13672,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I felt.slight twinges of electricity on my side. Nothing was there and thought hmm?? Then it dawned on me. Shingles could be brewing I have Valtrex that I take for occasional cold sores. I downed 2000mg immediately. Woke up the next day and went to my doctor. I only had one tiny pimple like thing on my side. My doctor confirmed it was shingles and that I did myself a huge favor taking the antiviral the night before. Easiest case of shingles ever
13678,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I can down with it when I was 46 and was so angry. I considered it something old people got and was already pissed that I was getting old. I was not even old enough to get the shot It took me out for about a week to 10 days. I still have a few weird fatty bumps under the skin on my left thigh. It sucked
13683,Hey friends. I just glanced at the calendar and realized I started Skyrizi a year ago which got me thinking about my experience. The headline is that to be honest I kind of do not think about my skin all that often anymore. Sorry I do not have beforeafter pics but I just could not bring myself to take photos. Now I wish I had. Background I am 40 male had psoriasis since I was five. Pretty classic moderate case elbows and knees covered fully by thick plaques some other random spots here and there. More body coverage as I aged scalp was quite bad etc. I had tried every topical known to man special diets etc. The thing that worked best for me was phototherapy which I did for a few years at 23 times per week but that was expensive and inconvenient and I never got fully clear especially on my scalp. Phototherapy had been by far the most effective treatment I had tried at that point. During a check up to renew the photo prescription my derm asked about my feelings on biologics. I had this conversation with doctors before years ago but my understanding was always that for my case it would not be worth the tradeoffs. Well my dermatologist spent some time explaining how far things had come and eventually referred me to a colleague who specializes in biologics. Getting it approved It took about six weeks after my doctor recommended Skyrizi for me to get the medication. There were hoops to jump through and luckily I had a doctor who knew how to jump through them. Insurance demanded that I try Methotrexate first so we tried it and after a couple weeks let them know it caused side effects that I was not willing to live with. It took a few more weeks to get approval run obligatory blood tests connect with the specialty pharmacy etc. I was eager to get started but I soon found I had to just let the process work. Starting Could not be easier to start. The resources for injecting at home are super helpful and soon enough I injected my first dose and immediately started watching my skin wondering if it would work for me. I noticed a definite flattening of plaques within 72 hours but that was it. Again I had to learn to trust the process. Progress It was not until the third shot two loading injections then one regular dose that I started to really see progress. My skin got better and better and soon my psoriasis was almost entirely gone. I stopped obsessing about it and then one day there was not anything left to obsess over. Side effects I got shingles a couple months after starting Skyrizi. My doc is not convinced that Skyrizi is the because but it is likely. It was a very unpleasant couple of weeks but it responded well to treatment and that was that. I also get very minor side effects after injecting which amounts to being tired and just laying around the rest of the day. But that is it Now I live as though I never had psoriasis which is still wild to realize. I wear shorts all the time cut my hair short swim workout etc. without ever giving it a thought. I struggled mightily with the emotional impacts of this disease in my youth as many of us do and I could have never imagined a single day let alone weeks and months where it not only is not my top concern but it does not even cross my mind at all. Before starting Skyrizi I was managing okay. Phototherapy worked well for me though not completely and I had mostly come to accept it. I have a wonderful wife who never cared about my psoriasis at all and I was happy. But I am happier now and I feel like I have been given a real gift after dealing with this for 35 years. In short I am one of the lucky ones. So glad I found this medication. AMA if you are thinking about starting. I know it is not for everyone but it is changed my life.
13687,Mild shingles case after 7 days of the first rash appearing. First pic is right leg second is right side of lower back and the third is right upper thigh. Feeling lucky that it is already looking better and the pain is pretty much gone. Is it normal for it to resolve so fast?: I think so? I am starting week 3 with my shingles. I feel very grateful that my rash right hip is limited to an area about the size of a playing card and two lone spots about the size of a nickel each. Things are starting to calm down the nerve pain is still hanging on but its lessening. I consider that quite mild. BUTI also got antivirals before the entire rash starting developing. This is my first experience with shingles I did not know what it was when my hip and back were al of the sudden in great pain. That was week 1. Excruciating pain. When the first red welt showed up I was like ohhhhh and headed to the doctor. I was given acyclovir Gabapentin and a lidocaine cream. It all helped. Soto answer your question I do not know if its normal but apparently there are mild cases. Knock on wood that neither one of us relapse. Take care
13689,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: My parents are two of these people. I started prescription birth control before becoming sexually active to help with insane menstrual cramps and my doctor recommended I get the vaccine. My parents made me refuse because they wanted to force me not to have sex. They did not test for HPV in men at the time I started having sex with my partner and he told me he had a clean STD panel. Nope Got a strain of HPV with highrisk of cervical cancer. I got the vaccine a couple years after that. I do not talk to my parents much anymore.
13690,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: You should get it I am 40 and just had shingles on my face it was super terrible
13691,Shingles vaccine: I was happy to get the shingles vaccine when my transplant team recommended it. I ve had shingles and it s incredibly painful.
13692,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles in my 30s. It was miserable. Got shingrix and the earlier vaccine. Do Not want to see it again
13694,Friend diagnosed with stage 4 cancer following numerous Covid jabs. Her husband had a dose of shingles. They are having the flu and Covid jabs next week. Another 4 months in hospital after a massive stroke had every Covid jab on offer. All called me a conspiracy theorist.
13695,So I 33f was diagnosed with shingles after my dumb ass finally made it too the Dr after a few days proclaiming to her I needed help getting rid of this nasty heat rash. The shingles had hilariously developed in the exact time frame I started wearing a back brace for sciatica and traveled the path of the nerve from lower spine around the right torso to front so I took no notice assuming I had worn the belt too tight and it is summer and I am exercising etc. Also waiting on an unrelated possible fibro diagnosis so took no notice of the pain lol. Was too late for antivirals my doctor told me and sent me home with ibuprofen. Not really enjoying this lol but at least they have burst and are mostly crusting over now. Pain seems to be localized entirely in the legs with random bursts of stomach pain. Was wondering if anyone else had dealt with this without antivirals and how it went? Read a lot of nasty stuff online about strokesheart attacks within a year without antivirals and wish I had not lol. I understand the statistics of it when you actually read it properly are like 44 people in 100000 but still did not appreciate seeing that. going to try and get the vaccine once this is cleared up. do not know why I wrote this all here but just had to vent I guess to all of you. TLDR I am not enjoying this and do not recommend.
13698,Today I went for my semiannual Prolia shot osteoporosis. It gets injected subcutaneously towards the back of my arm. It is usually the most painful shot I get surpassed only by last summer's RSV vaccine which went too deeply into the muscle. But this time I barely felt itonly a little bit more than my flu shots. The nurse remarked how easy it was and how thin my skin was. Obviously the difference from previous shots is that there is much less fat in there now.
13699,Shingles related to Covid? Pain months ahead outbreak: I forgot to say I am in Mexico so some things regarding healthcare are handled a bit different here. I actually called my endocrinolgist yesterday she knew about the armpit pain since the covid shot and infection and told me the same as my gyno. I asked her again about it and told me the same as GP in some people with comorbidities or inmune system problems in my case PCOSEndometriosisReactive hypoglycemiaallergies either Covid or the shots seems to reactivate the zoster virus making them more prone to shingles. However she also told me to be aware of other symptoms after it clears up because sometimes it can be a manifestation of an underlying health condition.
13700,Shingles at 22?: Well it sounds significantly mild then especially considering the length of time from first symptoms I was a mess after just a couple of days. Guess you will have to wait a bit longer and see but it maybe your immune system recovered better than average and or a milder outbreak.
13702,Valayclovir: Yeah I Am sure the PA did not look at the numbers. ButI started the meds and saw immediate resultsthe rash faded overnight which tells me its shingles. Since I had them on past then vaccinated shjngrex its a milder case.
13704,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Had mine last summer. It did because some delayed arm pain but not very much.
13707,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I wound up receiving an expired flu shot so it delayed me for my other immunizations. I got my RSV at 380. They recommend it sooner because it takes 14 days for it to finish effecting the baby and not everyone makes it to 40. I delivered at 401 so it did not wind up mattering that it was late. I had a slightly sore arm but otherwise no symptoms. Medically all of my practitioners agreed it was necessary I was super apprehensive about shots after my expired one.
13709,A friend of mine had two small pimples show up on his neck a week ago. Over the course of a few days they got worse he went to urgent care and the nurse practitioner googled shingles and told him that was what it was gave him a steroid shot and sent him home with a high dose of prednisone. He took six prednisone the first day and five the second day each day lowering by one pill until he is out per the nurse practitioner This is what they look like today. I do not have any experience with shingles but when I look it up online. It looks a lot different than what he has just seeing if anyone has seen shingles that look like this?
13711,Shingles: Omg bless you I hope it does not last long. I had shingles when I was 12 and I remember it was sore and I got at least a few weeks off P.E but I hope you are managing ok. Definitely speak to GP x
13714,First dose down: HI I took my first dose on Monday afternoon so I am still figuring things out. The nausea hit me hard over night Monday and then the headache hit Tuesday. The nausea was pretty intense till late yesterday when I started to feel normal again. So it took a couple days for me but today I am much better. My practitioner originally gave me Zofran 4mg which did not help much and I was constantly watching the clock to take the next dose as soon as i could. I called doc today to see how we can better manage the effects and she said more water electrolytes AND she doubled my dose of Zofran to 8mg. She also said if you are nauseous you do not eat and if you do not eat you feel more nauseous so be sure to always have something in your stomach even if just small meals but make sure you eat. I was on the fence about doing another dose because of the nausea being so bad but I am going to do another round with the increased Zofran and hope that helps. I hope you do not have any side effects a lot of people do not and I may just be super sensitive.
13720,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I just posted almost the same comment My uncle got it as an adopt from his young children. His first time. He ended up in the ICU and almost died.
13721,Shingles Is NO Joke: It was not terrible but it was not good. I remember feeling like I had the flu. Stuffy nose fatigue muscular pain and weakness. Oh gosh I Am sorry you have had that nerve pain. I hope it resolves soon.
13727,Finally out of my flare loving rinvoq more than I should as it is not a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: Shingles sucks Had it recently on Rinvoq as well. And I had gotten my shingles vaccine a couple years ago. Curious as well did you get the vaccine? I know we do not launch as good of a response to vaccines while on these meds but it did not seem to do anything for me. This round with shingles made me really sick. Last time I had shingles preRinvoq was more pain than anything else. Really hope you feel better soon
13728,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: I took amytriptyline for a couple months and had to stop. I had horrendous weight gain from it! Packed on at least 30lbs if not more. Still been trying to lose that pudge. It helped somewhat with migraines but not nearly enough to justify the weight gain that I endured."
13729,"Azathiaprine (Imuran): Hi all, not my first post here but I'm F/20s, UC 6 years, am tapering off yet another round of 40mg prednisone for a flare-up and have just started azathiaprine in addition to my usual mesalamine. I seem to have a shitty immune system in the first place (I catch everything that goes around and get it worse than others)- I'm super worried about azathiaprine exacerbating this problem and/or letting mono, shingles, or other latent viruses resurface! My doctor doesn't seem too concerned about it, but mono + shingles took me down hard this time last year and I really don't want a repeat of that. Has anyone had experience with this one way or the other? Also, wondering what effect, if any, this kind of drug use has on eventual fertility, and whether that's something I should be thinking about sooner rather than later - a question for my doctor I know, but just wanted to see if you guys had any insight!"
13730,Decreased movement 35 weeks after RSV vaccine: I Am not sure of any correlation with the vaccine and baby movement. But if you ever notice a change in movementpatterns call your birthing suite. I Am 30 weeks and have already been in twice for decreased movement. All was fine both times but the midwives are always happy for you to come in if you are concerned.
13731,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Next to my Csection shingles was the most intense pain I have ever felt. And all I had were two small spots on my back. Took two rounds of anti virals to knock it out and it was not something I would ever want to go through again. I cannot get the shot for another two years I have asked my doctor and was prepared to eat the cost. But nope got to wait. Guess I know what I am doing on my 50th birthday.
13732,Shingles vaccine: I have had three shots as I had the first shot more than ten years ago before they had the greatly improved version. I did not have any particular reaction except a slightiy sore arm the next day but I am not sure what that was caused by since I had vaccines for shingles Covid flu and RSV on the same day  two in each arm.
13735,"Just got my meningitis vaccine and now I'm feeling off. I thought getting vaccinated would be a quick and simple process, but I'm experiencing some unusual symptoms. Headaches, dizziness, and nausea have been plaguing me since I got the shot. I hope these side effects subside soon so I can go back to feeling like myself."
13738,A rare case: Mine started in the same place. Lower left side of back. Then wrapped around my side to by belly. I Am a bit surprised your doctor would say it was too late for antivirals. They help prevent the virus from multiplying as well as helps with the pain for most. I was on antivirals by day 56 from first day originally getting the pain. Had mild moderate pain and some blisters. I had chickenpox as a kid so that made sense how I got later in adult life. Your case is extremely rare. If you never had chickenpox and were vaccinated then most likely it was the vaccine itself that caused the shingles. Since the vaccine essentially contains a weakened form of the varicellazoster virus. So yes it is possible but much less common than someone that has had chickenpox in the past like me.
13739,I had the polio vaccine. Never got polio same with tetanus. Had the flu vaccine once in my life got the flu. Got the shingles vaccine once soon after got the shingles.
13741,Shingles vaccine: Mine were worse than a flu shot but not as bad as a tetanus shot.
13742,A week into a shingles infection: Sharpie outlining the rash before it kept spreading thanks for your kind wishes. Its still there and I Am definitely still in pain
13743,I got shingles the day after having my second shot. Did Not have any boosters after that. Shame I took the jabs for my job
13746,Shingles Vaccine: Zero issues here. No side effects at all that I can tell besides a slightly sore arm.
13748,Shingles vaccine experience: I got shingles in my early 50's. On my face right next to my eye. Got the vaccine both doses no real side effects no problems since.
13750,And you are too young to be allowed to get the shingles vaccine they should let us all get. Now that I have long Covid I do not think I can get the shingles vaccine so its like a double bind.
13755,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 78' got it from school when I was around 5ish. I do not think my case was very bad. I just remember being on the couch watching TV and being itchy and using calamine lotion. Got shingles at 42 while on vacation and it was hell. I do have scars from that one. That popped up exactly 1 month after getting my covid vaccine. Not sure if it is related but I read that it could have triggered an immune response.
13756,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: My mom had it she spent the rest of her life rolling up one sleeve to the shoulder because it irritated her skin. Insurance paid for my vaccine over 50. It is a PITA have to have two doses something like 60 days apart and I have never had a vaccine knock me on my butt as hard. But it is better than the alternative.
13757,Caused by covid vaccine aka shingles.
13758,I got three doses of vaccine two from the UK and one from the US. Shingles and skin fungus for almost two years now...hic
13760,The shingles vaccine sucks.: Unfortunately my GP has said I need to wait til 50 as it does not work as well in younger people. I am 46 now so I will keep asking. I have immune issues but not a compromised immune system. The first time I had shingles I was left with post herpetic neuralgia sciatica that lasted 7 years. The second time Valtrex was a lifesaver. I cannot vouch for the vaccine yet but I will say shingles is not fun. 010 Do not recommend.
13763,Flu and shingles shots?: As a pharmacist I have had many patients comment that they had a fairly strong flu like reaction to the shingles vaccine for a day or two. Others have had no issues. I had my first dose last month and no side effects at all. Your mileage may vary but if you are on immunosuppressant meds it is probably a good idea to stay on top of common vaccines like for respiratory illness and shingles.
13768,"Anyone med free?: I'm at a crossroads....been on Inflectra for 3 years, no flares. Had to stop because it caused drug induced lupus. My joints were all getting sore, fatigue, shortness of breath. I'm 45 now and thought, holy crap am I just getting old all the sudden. Long story short, I've been off it for 6 weeks now and some of those symptoms are improving, could take a while yet. My Doc wants to put straight onto Rinvoq, supposed to get a shingles vaccine next week because of it. Starting to feel like it's next drug up mentality. It also has a bunch of side effects. Feels like my best interest aren't really at play here, I'm not done with the previous drugs side effects, how will I be able to differentiate? Okay before I actually turn this into a long story....anyone just say forget it, I'm done with the drugs and try and deal with it through diet and healthy living?"
13772,Shingles vaccine: I did not notice any effects from the singles vaccine at all.
13773,Shingles vaccine: Never had shingles vaccine BUT my dumbass husband got flu Covid shingles AND tetanus shot...ALL OF THEM YESTERDAY. Yeah he is fucking ailing today.
13779,I agree with you that for SOME people me included the Shingrix 1st shot did NOT go well. This was 6 yrs ago... I have talked to others who have not had a problem with it though. I will give you a lil more info you would not normally find... the CDC has changed their webpage...
13780,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My kids got the chickenpox vaccine too. Unfortunately it did not fully prevent them contracting chickenpox. Their case was super mild but I Am sad they will be at risk of shingles.
13781,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: This. I really worry about the anti vacxer kids not getting a measles vaccine later in life. My dad grew up poor before vaccine got measles in 40s then got shingles twice with a shingles vaccine in the middle. No fun
13782,Met a frail older woman recently who had an adverse reaction to the shingles vaccine leading to multiple falls. She went back to the GP for an opinion as to what was wrong. The response? Given the Covid flu vaccines simultaneously.
13783,RSV Vaccine: Mine got it in the NICU as a preemie. No issues at all.
13786,Shingles vaccine: I had three friends all get shingles at 49. Horribly sick. I started my series of shots the week I turned 50. I always get vaccines on a Friday in case I feel crappy for a day or two. Surprisingly I felt fine after both shots. I always felt lethargic after every COVID or flu shot so I was expecting it to be much worse But I know it can hit quite a few people in a rough way. So worth it I AM GOING TO.
13787,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: My wife and i were fortunate enough to have no side effect other than a sore arm for either shot.
13788,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: If you get chicken pox young it can be quite mild. I got it at 17 and it was hell. I still have some scars in my 50s. I got shingles in my 30s no scars but 2 weeks of incredibly painful fever absolute hell lost 10lbs. Get the damn shot.
13789,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: I got this vaccine during Covid. That was a painful shot. I think it was 2 shots. So happy I got it over with.
13791,A friend of mine is vaccine and boosted multiple times. She Is has shingles three times in a year 12.
13792,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: My husband and I both felt pretty out of it for a day after both shots"
13806,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles at 49. I wanted to die. Got the vaccine at 50. No more shingles since. It worsened my asthma so be mindful if you have asthma or any sensitivities. So glad I got the vaccine. I Do Not Know if I could do shingles again.
13807,Update Not Just Shingle: My housemate broke a rib from falling. He then fell again a week or two later and broke another one and my toddler went to play with him and slammed into his poor ribs again. He also gave himself bursitis in the shoulder on the same side as the two broken ribs. Poor guy he was told healing was like six weeks but his gp said its like six months plus. All of this to say I can kind of understand the ribs situation you went through purely from my housemates situation. It must have been really scary and must be pretty painful. That plus shingles when shingles is awful on its own. Yikes. I hope you get to heal and rest try to take it easy.
13808,"Shingles vaccine: second dose: I've never have an reaction to flu and Covid boosters in the past, so I think the Shingles vaccine was the one that affected me. I had chills the night of, and a headache the next day. My arm was red for about a week."
13809,2 doctors gave me 2 different diagnosis and I am lost.: My first Shingles outbreak affected inside my mouth my tongue my cheek creeping into my right ear canal. The worst pain was in my ear. It affected 2 dermatones so the doc told me initially Herpes the STD but I tested negative yet tested positive for Zoster. My 234 outbreaks were right shoulder right under my right scapula and close to my spine. I could not lay down for 2 weeks after my second outbreak. Shingles are weird man.
13810,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: My girl had a fever that night and was more pukey. I gave her Tylenol when I knew she was not feeling well and it worked like a charm
13811,Shingrix vaccine side effects from second dose: Same here. Both of them were like getting hit by a train. Get them on Friday. You start feeling better by Sunday morning.
13813,My father was dealing with the impact of shingles a year and a half after he got it. I got my vaccine the day I turned 50. A couple of crap days but considering the alternative easy.
13815,I acquired two doses of Shingrix which I am keeping refrigerated. Waiting for a recurring outbreak on my left butt cheek to fade away. Can anyone report their experience waiting for clearance taking a vaccine dose and noticing any differences going forward? Any advice?
13817,Good idea. I took it when I had shingles.
13818,Ughh two years no outbreak . Immense stress shingles outbreak for me: Oh my goodness so sorry mama I Am having my first outbreak in 4 years I Am almost 31 and have had it about 5 times first being when I was 8 . I have an almost 5 yr old and 15 month old and just had them get the vaccine for chickenpox. This time though it started across my chest and is now also on my shoulder Praying for you and your little
13820,"Should I get a Varicella booster?: 19F, I'm a nursing student and I'll be working in a hospital soon as a nurse extern. I had a visit with a nurse at the hospital on Monday and she drew my blood to do titers for Hep B and Varicella. I got the results for my Varicella-Zoster IgG which came back as 159 (which got flagged as low, LabCorp says immunity is considered greater than 165). With 159 being pretty close to the 165 needed for immunity, should I get a booster? I had my initial two shots, the most recent one being in 2012. I don't mind getting a booster if it will help protect me but I'm not sure if it's necessary with my antibody levels being pretty close to being considered immune. I've never had an actual Chickenpox infection as far as I know. The nurse at the hospital said it wouldn't be required but like I said, I have no issue with getting it if it will be beneficial for me. Just wondering if I need it/should get it. I have allergies and some other weird autoimmune things but as far as I can tell I'm not more susceptible to illness than anyone else. I'm pretty healthy overall (aside from my health conditions but physically I'm in good shape). Let me know if you need any other information! TIA."
13821,Shingles vaccine: My case was bad my wifes was a nightmare she has permanent scarring and nerve damage. She delayed getting help and it the shingles went crazy on her. Do Not delay a trip to the doctor as soon as you start getting the signs. Get the vaccine. Both shots.
13822,Shingles and GenX: worst pain I have ever felt... even compared to surgery
13824,shingles with no rash: I have been experiencing this for a week now. I got terrible burning pain on the skin of my under arm and back side of arm and shoulder. EXTREMELY sensitive to even the slightest touch even the softest clothing  getting goose bumps from the cold was even worse.  I saw a chiropractor day 3 first to rule out nerve pain related to a possible neck problem he suggested it could be shingles and suggested a very heavy regimen of zinc vitamin D and Vitamin c. I went to GP the 4th day she started me on valacyclovir. I have still not presented any rash. The pain has gotten slightly better the last two days so I am hoping the worst is over. The pain of this is hard to explain and feels strange to not have any visual symptoms. It feels less validating to me although I am very thankful to not suffer that terrible rash I hope you get better quickly 
13828,Postshingles neuropathy on my face is driving me insane 36: Ohbless your heart I hope it was not too bad my bouts escalated exponentially Take care
13831,Shingles and other Vaccines: I tend to get sick after vaccinations but I feel they are worth it. I had shingles twice and it was horrifying. I got the shingles shot and have not had shingles since and it is well worth it.
13833,Hate to tell you. The second vaccine for Shingles hits way harder at least my husband and I found this. Good luck
13834,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Just got my second shot today. First round I was just really tired, if memory serves. So far so good on number two 7 hours post vaccine. I hope you feel better!! Also, the two shots bring you to 90% protection. That means you still have a 10% chance to get shingles, although it should be weaker and not last as long."
13835,Not sure what this could be allergy bug fungus shingles??? Its been since Monday. This is not the first time this summer I have gotten a rash that made me feel sick after being outside in grass but this is by far the worst. I Have taken Benadryl put cortisone cream on it diaper rash cream etc. The spots themselves are getting redder and spreading but no new spots have appeared. The last two pics are from day one and the first few pics are today and yesterday to see how its changing I Am waiting for health insurance because i moved so I might not be able to get to a doc til next week. Hence going to Reddit. Thank you all
13838,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Ask your doctor and your pharmacist about getting them early. I had my pneumonia vaccine at 26 because I am immunocompromised and covid ruined my lungs. I got pneumonia from a cold and that was all it took to matter enough to be vaccinated against it so getting shingles in your 20s must count
13842,Diagnosed with HPV I Am a virgin who has not had any sexual contact: My parents were super proactive about me getting Gardasil shots and I still got high risk HPV with cell changes. Its a good thing to get the vaccine for sure but I think the efficacy may be a bit overstated.
13847,41 and got Shingles: I got shingles when I was 19. It was horrible. I still have permanent nerve damage on my upper back. I am 40 now.
13849,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: It is rarer but you can still get shingles just from getting the chickenpox vaccine. I never had chickenpox but had the vaccine and I got it on my face a few weeks ago and am only getting over it now.
13850,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have had shingles. They were across my back chest stomach and spread down one of my thighs before the appropriate medication was prescribed. Shingles across the nips suuuuuuuucked It was about 6 years ago now. I have scars everywhere and I am still struggling with the nerve damage done to my spine. I would not wish shingles on my worst enemy. But I cannot describe the glee with which I cackled reading that Trish got shingles. I hope they burn. It is a fitting punishment. Though I genuinely do not think she or OOP's husband will have a change of heart and feel any remorse. OOP is better off without them. Go for full custody get that child support. Surely his supporting his mother in deliberately exposing that sweet baby to a vicious painful virus will work in OOP's favour?
13851,I feel like they are just daring some rogue nation to smuggle in a suitcase nuke for some biblical karma. Like that female comedian that bragged that she had been double jab and got the shingles shot and collapsed 10 seconds later.
13853,Weird I have a reaction to every vaccine... but shingles was fine Get well soon
13854,Shingles vaccine: I did but due to covid and or travel I spaced the 2 shots out to the last day before I would have had to start over. So I wonder how effective it is. I am prone to cold sore and once had some kind of shinglesnon sexual herpes spot on my neck. I also had what I belive was a shingles lik virus attack the nerves in my face and head. Very scary. Trigeminal neuralgia is a suicide condition. So I am hoping the shot works broader similar viruses at least to reduce severity. I rarely get bacterial infections though.
13856,"If amitriptyline helps you, how long did it take?: Thanks for your input! Spongy is a great word for how this medication makes me feel"
13859,31 yr old male: Once will not do it. You have got to get the booster. The people I know who felt kind of rough only felt badly for a day or two after the second dose only. Totally worth it to me too. Oh wait you mean not get vaccinated and get the shingles once? There is no guarantee you will get it and if you do it will absolutely be way worse than the mild side effects you will get from the vaccine.
13860,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: Oh I see. It s over now Good to hear things have calmed down.
13861,Shingrix cost C174.52 per shot: I nearly lost an eye within 24 hrs of getting shingles. Get out of here with this rugged individualism. Shingles affects everyone differently. Do what you want for you but playing this do your research crap to scare others out of avoiding one of the worst experience you can have in life including repeatedly getting it is dangerous. Do Not listen to this person whatsoever OP
13862,Baby due in November large group of extended family coming into town. Any advice?: No no no. No way. That is a recipe for disaster in all possible ways. Thank you all so much for the love and desire to connect with baby when they are here. Because so much of birth and postpartum can be unexpected and given the serious impact illness can have on newborns we are respectfully asking to postpone visits until after flu season the first month the first round of vaccinations etc.. If it works for your schedules we would love to Thanksgiving in our town next year. If you want to take an alternate route or have other visitors set your rules for those early visits. My baby was born last November and we required updated TDAP for everyone and flu shots. Updated covid was ideal but not required and I was able to get the RSV shot in pregnancy. For family members who often travel get sick were taking an international trip just before I postponed their visit until baby had a few vaccination rounds. I found a lot of reassurance in posts with reminders that this is your baby. Their safety is your priority and YOU get to say how to make that happen. Especially if illnesses always happen after these gatherings not a freaking chance would I do that. We were so careful and still our baby had to go to the hospital for an infectionfever at 6 weeks and it was absolutely awful and so overwhelming. Family will get over it and if they do not oh well.
13863,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Shingles SUCKS. I Am so sorry you had to deal with it. My daughter got the CP vaccine so thankfully she never got it
13866,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My mom took my brother and I to a chickenpox party when I was four. I still have scars all over my face and body nearly forty years later. My mom got shingles twice and it was a horrible experience for her. Not even sorry for her.
13867,All of a sudden top minds know so many people that have got shingles and died because of the covid vaccine.: I had shingles in my late 20s and it was absolutely horrendous. I was lucky that it was not on my face but I was unlucky in that mine appeared on my lower back right in that spot that bendsmoves the most when you are sitting down and standing up. Plus it was partially on my spine on the affected side. The pain was constant as excruciating for about two months. I could hardly stand sit or lie down without unimaginable pain. I would have to mentally prep myself every time I sat stood or went to bed. It was so bad I was googling how long it would last and searching Reddit for other peoples experiences every night as I tried to get comfortable and ignore the pain just to have some kind of unknown potential end date and peace of mind and light at the end of the tunnel. I have no lasting damage fortunately but I felt oddly numb in places for a long time after it finally went away. Get the vaccine. If I could go back in time I would. Its worth any inconvenience to your day plus cost to not have to go through that.
13868,I have had shingles on and off for the past 14 months. I have been using valtrex and an ointment. Male 29PA How to get vaccine: Your doctor should be writing to your insurance company. I had my first shingles issue at 25 and was able to get the vaccine by my doctors consent. He did have to send some authorization in to get it covered by insurance and said that there really was not enough studying done on the meds with someone my age. But I did not care. I got the vaccine and did not have an issue for almost 11 years. I Am 37 and just had another vaccine this year had a flare up in February this year.
13869,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: We did it in the NICU 2 days after birth. he is a perfectly healthy thriving almost 3 month old now
13872,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I am 38 and I got chicken pox from a chicken pox party honestly did not knowing they were still a thing or not but I am pretty sure a key part of the party is that the parents knew that is what it was not a surprise chicken pox party Also had shingles unknowingly met someone with chicken pox and that was not fun.
13874,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: I take 2 25mg pills before bed so 50mg total. I take them every day. I was doing the 1 in the morning 1 at night thing but they make me sleepy so I just take them before sleep now. I wish they did not affect me so bad when I Am drinking. I Do Not Know if maybe I Have become a lightweight from taking a step back from drinking with friends and stuff but I really do think its the Pregablin that gets me all fucked up because it feels different drinking than it used to before. I also tried not taking them before when I was drinking like literally 2 weeks ago actually and the next day I was SO FUCKING NAUSEOUS AND DIZZY and also started to get REALLY ANXIOUS it was insanel I looked it up and it was withdrawal because I had gone just 36 hours without my 50mg. I am with you on hating this stupid pain and situation. Like damn I get some stupid chicken pox mutation disease and now I Am in pain for the next foreseeable years? Seems so unfair. I do not want to live like this
13876,39 F 125 lbs 51 normal bp and bloodwork I went in today for what I thought was a prescreening for a clinical trial for an RSV vaccine only to leave feeling slightly worried. When asked about my medical history I let them know that I have POTS postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. The girl who did my paperwork left with it and the doctor came in the room visibly annoyed. He asked when my last episode was and I told him I have not had any real episodes in 2 plus years just some lightheadedness upon standing very rarely. He said I need to follow up with a cardiologist. I was under the care of both a cardiologist and electrophysiologist but was discharged from care by both. I had a battery of tests to even figure out that I had POTS. Echocardiogram extended halter monitor and bloodwork. Only the tilt table test figured out the POTS. He left the room then came back and asked to listen to my heart. He asked Has anyone ever told you have a heart murmur? I told him no that I have been to the doctor many times recently and none have ever told me that. He said again that I should do a follow up with a cardiologist to be sure. The girl who did my paperwork came in and said I was disqualified because of the POTS and the heart murmur. Is this something that I should be really concerned with? I do not want to impugn wrong motive but it felt like he tried to find any reason to dismiss me but I want to do what is right for my health as well.
13877,F RSV: My daughter got the RSV shot in November but we were somehow exposed to it two weeks ago. She got over it in a few days but it knocked me on my ass. I STILL have a cough from it.
13879,Shingrix cost C174.52 per shot: Shingles has cost me a hospital bill plus nearly two weeks off of work. The vaccination is the cheaper option by far
13881,Boy LDN worked quick on me and triggered a pretty instantaneous herpes outbreak. Its definitely from the LDN not sure exactly which action but by dose 2 I got nerve pain in my face and throat swelling with lymph node swelling. By dose 3 my right lymph node was abnormally firm and swollen and a herpes outbreak in my right nostril had kicked off. I Am on day 7 and it will be dose 5 I took a couple of off days in between but the herpetic response is strong Its definitely from the LDN I have not had an outbreak in ages and besides starting the new med my stress level is not abnormally high nor have I had any typical triggers. I have HSV1 and my theory is I Am low grade fighting it all the time throughout the nerves of my head and face. In the past I Have had shingles level pain in my trigeminal nerve and other bizarre nerve stuff in my face and head which was from HSV1despite medical doctors saying its not how HSV1 works its definitely happened in my case. I Am down to keep taking the herbs supplements and medicine for HSV if LDN works for my other symptoms but I do have questionsconcerns about if LDN might create a viral issue where it was in remission or if it really is as some here say that its a healing crisis. I am hesitant with that concept as I Have not always seen this to be the case but I Am open to the possibility and would like some community feedback. What have other peoples herpes experiences been with LDN? Thank you
13883,Shingles vaccine: I did not get sick but I had a pretty sore arm each time. I got it soon after one of my staff at work who is my age got it. She was out for weeks and when she came back was taking pain pills for another month she said the pain was pretty intense. No thanks I love vaccines
13885,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox as a first grader did not go to a party just lucky enough to catch it. At 26 I developed shingles and it was the worst pain I had felt until childbirth. I Am so thankful for the vaccine now and my kids will not have to go through two painful illnesses.
13887,Shingles vaccine experience: The pain of the vaccine is definitely worth it. My mom had excruciating pain from her last shingles episode that lasted over 6 months in which time she was essentially a shutin because of it. My roommate from college had her first shingles episode when she was 18 so people should not assume that this is just a disease for old people although usually the case. She is one of those people who had it in her eye area. She did not lose her eyesight with that episode but her doctor warns that each episode is likely to be worse.
13888,Shingles Is NO Joke: Its bad. I was thinking appendix gallbladder kidney stones broken rib. Yes its that bad. Aching burning stabbingand its constant and relentless. Every time I bend over and then bend back upevery time I go to the bathroom I scream and I Am on pain meds. My poor husband just does not know what to do. I mean he just watches in horror. Because there is nothing he can do. He cannot make it go away.
13889,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: The second one had heavy side effects for two days for me.
13894,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: I had Ramsay Hunt and a high risk of permanent paralysis deafness blindness. I never want that ever again. Like ever.
13896,Wife had first dose of Ov rev us got shingles. Wish I had known the tingling burning sensation on face and scalp were early signs of Shingles. We knew headaches were side effects of the drug but when we notice a small rash form on her face we knew something wasn t normal. Seems to be a very uncommon side effect unfortunately go her she got it.
13901,Shingles vaccine experience: Mother had her first bout of shingles about 20 years ago It began involving her eye. Had to threaten the ER doc over the phone because he had already turned her away twice. To this day she has pain in the nerve it followed. She gets shots for the pain every other month that last maybe 2 weeks. The pain gets so extreme that her face sags like a stroke patient. She can barely talk when her pain creeps over 6. She has not been able to wear her dentures for the last 15 years due to the pain. I was able to get my shots early.
13903,What is going on at the VA VHA?: Ugh I got shingles at the end of July and it has kicked my ass as the nerve pain went waaaaaay beyond the rashblister area and has persisted past that clearing up. I still cannot wear a shirt without pain or lay down to sleep under covers. And I am only 37 so I was not even vaccine recommended given my age. tldr do not skimp on the vaccine checks. shingles is miserable.
13905,Shingles vaccine experience: I got the shingle shot a few years back and have not regretted it at all. I suffered at least once a year with shingles outbreaks and not only are the painful and gross looking they do not go away on their own which meant I had to take antiviral drugs for them and those drugs made me so sick at my stomach. I do not miss shingles...nope.
13909,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents had a friend whose daughter got it. We had a sleepover despite the fact that we did not really like each other. It bit my mom in the ass. She thought she would had it as a kid but she had not. She picked it up from me and my brother got it too. My dad was the only person in the house who was not sick for the next week. My mother had a spot on her eyelid a couple in her ears it was bad and she was still pretty youngshe was 23. The disgusting part is they thought my mothers history and the fact that she was still breastfeeding my brother would mean he was fine. He was only 3 months old. Edit to add he actually did better than the rest of us and is now a healthy 30yearold.
13914,Shingles vaccine experience: I had no ill effects whatsoever from the vaccine but I would not care if I had a friend of mine had shingles and it was absolutely hell for her for months.
13916,Genital HSV1 or Recurrent Shingles?: Yes that is a good point my lesions in my anus never looked like fresh sores though just small cuts and they look unchanged even though the pain is improving. I wish they had swabbed the initial sores Oh interesting did your IgG ever come back positive after your positive IgM? I wonder if you are IgM was a false positive
13918,Need advice for taking zoster vaccine: I have multiple autoimmune diseases and it was likely triggered by Imu ran that I take for S jog ren's but any medication that suppresses immune response puts you at risk. I am on multiple suppressant s but my shingles broke out both when I started imu ran around six w ks after and around three weeks after we increased my dosage.
13919,Diagnosed with HPV I Am a virgin who has not had any sexual contact: You Are not the only one . I Am 26F and a virgin  fully vaccinated . Not sure if its HPV but I have wart on my finger and other part of body . Try not to stress out so much and take supplements daily . Nothing that I could do but take good care of myself .
13920,My experience as a PsA patient on MTX who got the flu COVID and shingles vaccine all at once.: Thanks I am glad to hear you are feeling better too I can tell I am needing more painkillers than usual. Came home after a two hour somewhat leisurely walk with the dog and my anklesarches were achy and after feeling the dog I napped for two hours blissfully having taken four ibuprofen and a pepcid.
13922,Shingles and other Vaccines: Yep all my vaccines are scheduled for my husband to be home with me for 4872 hours afterwards because I get miserably sick from all vaccines. I need to get my pnuemonia and RSV this year. They have to be separated by at least a month and my pharmacist I get my vaccines at my pharmacy so I do not have to deal with my idiot pcpprefers 3 months between if possible so my immune system settles down between vaccines. OP do you by chance have an autoimmune disorder?
13928,Shingles vaccine: I had them in 2018. Sore heavy arm was my side effect. But my insurance paid for it. I know 3 people who had Shingles. Its horrid.
13930,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I could not lift either of my arms above my head for several days.
13931,"Shingles or Influenza antivirus shot psoriasis flare up: Has anyone has a flu shot and it caused a flare up? I got a flu shot and shingles shot exactly a year ago and I've had a psoriasis flare up ever since. It almost went away about 6 months ago but then I had to take the required 2nd shingles shot and the psoriasis came right back. In case your wondering, my wife got shingles so I thought it'd be a safe precaution and since I was gonna be getting that I went ahead and got the flu shot for the first time in my life."
13932,How to get shingles vaccine when insurance will not cover it at a pharmacy?: Hello I am 28 and got my shingles vaccine today I went to my doctor and said i wanted it. She said its only recommended after you are 50. Your insurance will not cover it and its really expensive 500. I said sounds great let us do it She looked at me like I grew a second head. They made me sign a waiver saying I would be responsible for it if my insurance did not cover it. Seemed surprised I pushed back after she told me the price what is an HSA for if not for this am i right haha. Happily struted out of the office with a sore arm
13935,Vaccine Schedule: We are on a delayed schedule just because my son kept getting sick. My daughter was never late even during the pandemic. My son is sick frequently beside she brings home everything from school. He is 17 months and just got his MMR last week. He got his 6 months at a year and since then he has had croup GI bug x2 and then HFM We had to wait almost 2 months after HFM appeared as he had a pretty severe case. I apologized to my doctor and said hopefully we be able to get back on track. He just said to me its better to be late than to not do them at all.
13936,Ooh shingles Waiting to have my vaccine Been a couple of weeks since vaccine and latest covid19 vaccine so I would better book in. My sister had a terrible time with them. I am bad enough only able to get round on crutches for a short distance so do not need that as well
13948,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in '87. Caught chickenpox in '95. Very mild case slightly itchy. My little brother who was born in '94 caught it from me and we both just barely missed out on the vaccine. I also got shingles at the age of 28 which caught me completely by surprise as I thought shingles only affected older people. Also I just had it on my right arm with barely any rash so did not know what was going on exactly. Finally went to the doctor when my arm and hand completely locked up into a sort of death claw and became unusable. Got prescribed gabapentin and hydrocodone and a week off work. I chilled on the couch playing Skyrim on our PS3 and it was honestly one of the best staycations I have ever had lol
13951,I felt that way after my shingles vaccine x2. The latest c19 was pretty tame this time around.
13953,As many members here do I suffer from chronic back pain. I Have done everything the doctors ask and then some but still have yet to find relief outside of my medical marijuana when I Am so high I cannot function. Recently I had a failed SCS install check post history for story and it took away my ability to walk normal. I have to walk kind of like a toddler until I can get my feet under me so I get sent to rehab. The rehab doctor is super nice. She explains to me that its normal with spinal cord injuries to have weird sensations of touch and such and even changes to my taste buds which makes sense because nothing I have eaten since my surgery has tasted good. I can taste the sweetness of chocolate and that is about it so I started eating lots of it. Throughout all the stress I endured from surgery I developed shingles. I just turned 40. The rehab doctor sat me down and explained something to me though. Doctors still do not know how the spine works. They do not understand the intricacies and how nerves react to trauma etc. She said they throw out these surgeries in hopes that well latch on to the idea and go through with it. But from her perspective a doctor in the field of rehabilitation from these specific types of damageissues with the back is basically telling me without telling me that back surgery is a shot in the dark. That Is why so many fail while others are cured. The charts may be intentionally read wrong in order to push someone to have surgery or an implant or some other device that makes the doctor more money. She said its all about the money nothing about helping people because they still have so much to learn to even make them effective. It was equated to me along the same lines as a lobotomy as she said lumbar spine surgery will end up being the lobotomy of our time here. I was floored. Telling me that after all these years and all these surgeries they were never intended to help just mask it. It all feels like a lie and I am so tired. Too tired to even fight back against it. They win. Ill do my rehab and regain what motion and control I can  but leave my back tf alone. I post this because there are lots of people on the edge about whether or not to do a surgery. This opened my eyes.
13957,I had 16 shingles outbreaks in 3.5 years. Every month the outbreaks were getting closer and closer. Shingles is a form of herpes although not sexually transmitted as HSV 12. Instead is a reactivation in your body from the chicken pox virus. Every outbreak did more severe damage to my CNS my nerves my spine ... mimicking symptoms of MS to even intercranial pressure that led to a concurrent state of viral enciphalitis. My story is I had nothing left to lose and I tried drinking 35 hydrogen peroxide three times a day starting at 1 drop building to 25 drops and working back down to 21 and then 11 drops which I have kept consistent for the past five months. I have not had a single shingles outbreak and am claiming my life back. I really was in such severe pain and on so many nerve pain meds and antivirals that were causing side effects of tremors seizures musckoskeletel damage and such severe photosensitivity I could not go outside during daylight safely. The nerve pain meds 2400 miligrams of gabapentin to control the pain turned me into a monster made me suicidal I had no will to live. I was capable of things I have never been capable of previous to the drugs. After getting off of EVERYTHING by weaning over the course of months gabapentin withdrawl was worse than opioid withdrawl I had previously experienced I kept up with the hydrogen peroxide oxygenation therapy. Yes 35 is required. YES IT IS DANGEROUS IF NOT DILUTED PROPERLY. And YES it is safe if followed properly. I have nothing to sell nor did the woman who told me about this cure. I am sharing because it saved my life and there is no sensical response as to why I was having breakout after breakout every 34 weeks taking over my body to not a single outbreak. I must note I also tried this therapy in the form of ozone therapy done with a needle at a center by a licensed physician's assistant. It is the same process but done through a blood transfusion and then I followed with the hydrogen peroxide ingestion. YOU CANNOT EAT FOOD OR DRINK WITHIN 3 hours of each dose. Fat and antiocidants bind to oxygen molecules and can do DAMAGE TO YOUR SYSTEM. If you are careful and follow rules your side effects should be minimal. Each dose made me very nauseous and ill. It still does but a far cry from what I was experiencing. I eventually plan to end ingestion of the peroxide with just maintenance maybe once or twice a week because I believe I am cured. My own study shows it is either preventative or I am cured. I will be getting my lab results again for antibodies on the 6month mark which is approaching soon. If it is still on the panel I will continue this as a preventative treatment because another outbreak is not worth it to me. If you are at wits end I must recommend you research THROUGHLY and find the program of the oxygenation therapy to save yourself. Maybe it will not work for everyone but I am not the only person I have read about that this worked for.
13960,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles in my mid 20s. Still get an occasional burning sensation 10 years later on my abdomen because of nerve damage.
13961,Hi all Last week I noticed a very swollen lymph node that was tender to the touch On Nov 28 saw a nurse practitioner virtually offered by work he said it s just from me scratching my head and having an open lacerations. Thought that was odd because next day I woke up and there is an area above the swollen tender lymph node where it is a bit numb constant tingle burning and itching. It feels like a constant pulling of my hair in that specific area. On Nov 29 Went to a walk in clinic doctor said it is scalp dermatitis. I asked if the burning tingle was because the lacerations were inflamed she said yes. Went to my family doc in Dec 2nd. As I was explaining my symptoms. He said it sounds like shingles. Good news is that there is no rash yet. I m on antivirals now. Over the weekend I had random stabbing sharp pains in my scalp but that seems to be better. Has anyone else have a similar experience? Reason why I put possibly shingles is bc it s shingles without the rash. Or maybe I caught it early enough before the rash pops up. I m going to Cabo on dec 16. Is it a safe assumption that I pro b will be ok by then? And by okay I mean no rash forming? I am 34 f. This is th second time I ve had shingles. First time was March 2020. Definitely related to work stress. I don t think this is normal. Should I get shingle vaccine in a few months?
13962,I am booked in for a couple of weeks time  have to have them midway between monthly kesimpta doses. Had the 2nd shingles one last month. do not usually get side effects  just a sore arm with the shingrix.
13964,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Ohhhh man. thank you for that i just woke up after finally bring able to sleep for more than an hour from pain and that def helps deter me from trying that because I cannot imagine it getting any worst
13965,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Get the vaccine I tell everyone that. YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET SHINGLES. I had it in my mid 30's and holy fuck it was the most painful thing I ever experienced. I did not know what it was when it started as a rash across my torso. The nerve pain is insane it felt like a million needle stabbing me constantly.
13967,Spacing out Shingles Vaccine: Yes I asked the pharmacist this question yesterday She said do them both on a weekend and have one crappy day Also I was unvaccinated and have shingles rn. It s awful and potentially dangerous. Folks if you re over 50 get the shin gri x vaccine. Even if you ve already had it per CDC guidelines.
13968,Anyone here get it? I never had chickenpox as a kid doctor ran a panel to show I have no immunity and should get the chickenpox vaccine as an adult. Since it is a live vaccine there is a small risk of getting a form of chickenpox from the vaccine itself. Knowing my luck and whatever whacky thing is going on in our bodies I worry about doing that to myself. But there is also risk I catch chicken pox from elderly folks in my life that get shingles. Or if my partner got shingles he had chickenpox as a kid I do fine with the flu shot but that is not a live vaccine I did okayish with the MRNA Moderna vaccines just a week of typical vaccine sideeffects fever aches etc
13969,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got chicken pox already when I was 13 had a very small shingle rash on my back about 5 years ago. I Am almost 52so would a vaccine do me any good?
13971,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I got shingles in my early 20s and it was the closest to death that I have ever come. My roommates dunked me into the tub with cold water while they waited for the ambulance. I woke up in the hospital 2 days later. Get this shot.
13973,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: I gave it 3x to our preemie nurses gave it lol I am similar I am usually okay with vaccines but definitely feel stressed about RSv one Its been fine for us and my son was I think 8lbs when he got first one 12lbs now
13974,Shingles and swelling neck only on left side: The same thing happened to me. I also had blisters in my nose. I had the sores on my tongue left side and gums and teeth. Weird pressure itching kind of pain.
13975,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I Have only had 1 of the shingles shots. I get the next one in October. It only gave me a sore arm and had zero side effects.
13977,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: I had it in my eye and face, took 3 weeks for it to subside and 3 months for my face not to look like I was in a car accident. I would have paid $20K to avoid the pain and suffering. It was sooo terrible."
13981,Did not have any reaction at all to the shingles shots. I did have shingles though and any minor reactions from the vaccine are worth it not to get shingles again.
13987,I Am 42f and first time fellow shingler. I was training for a race and I think I was overdoing it. I Am on day 5 on valtrex and prob day 8 of having a rash. Not feeling super bad mainly the skin pain but in my lower back my rash is on my back and belly on the left side and mostly I just feel exhausted zero energy and flu like symptoms. I Am not going to try and race as I would have done it but I still want to give it a try. How for has it take to feel to almost normal? Race and trip are October 6. I Am so sad I cannot do it as I wanted but at this point I just want to think that I can at least go.
13988,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: This is exactly what happened to me when I came down with shingles. I spent 2 days trying to figure out where I got this horrible case of poison ivy at
13991,Same Shingles vaccine was unexpectedly brutal. Made me realize all the more that I most certainly would not want to get shingles
13992,We had our Shingrix as soon as we could. Had no problems afterwards that I can recall. Maybe a slightly sore arm but nothing of note.
13993,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Had my first shingles outbreak when I was 18. Being in the military tends to stress you out enough for that. Once every few years I will have a twinge of the same pain in the location my outbreak was in but has not been full blown sores.
13995,Just got the flu shot yesterday and now my arm is so swollen and painful. I called the clinic but they said it's a common reaction and should subside soon. Has anyone else experienced this after getting the flu shot? Any tips on how to reduce the swelling and pain?
13996,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Speaking as someone who got it in my midlate 20s I think around 27 at the same time my infant son got it my case was SO much worse than his. And since 95 of the population has had it made sense to get it young since generally the symptoms are less.
13998,I never got a reaction to any vaccine except the Shingles one. I never reaction to dose 2.
14004,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yeah you can go blind if you get it near your eyes. Now are you glad you got the vaccine I am
14008,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it two years ago on the right side of my scalp and ear. I also have psoriasis which is itchy at the best of times. The pain was worse than when I fell into a wasps nest as a kid. Go for the vaccine
14009,Hi all I had an interesting appointment yesterday with my pulmonary doctor I have been having weird breathing issues the past year or so. I saw an asthma specialist back in May after what I thought was a couple of major asthma attacks wheezing and unable to catch my breath after somewhat mild excertion on a trip back in March. The doctor diagnosed me with asthma but was confused by my restrictive breathing pattern rather than the more typical obstructive one in asthmatic patients. When my follow up breathing test showed zero change after 6 weeks of being on Breo he sent me to a pulmonary specialist. My lung capacity is 50 of what is normal for my age 49 too. I just had my second appointment with this doctor and after a chest xray and a PFT breathing test he has a whole new suspect behind my issues diaphragm paralysis on my right side. The difference in position on my chest xray between my right and left lungs was striking. He mentioned viruses as a potential because and used Shingles as an example. Well I had it back in 2019 on my right side on the siatic nerve. It was horrible Since my issue is in my right lung and diaphragmatic paralysis is usually caused by dysfunction of the Pharenic nerve my doctor did not think the fact my Shingles outbreak also involved my right side was a coincidence. He is not ready to say it is definitely my diaphragm but it is a very strong suspicion. I am waiting for a callback to schedule a sniff test and a high resolution CT scan. I have an appointment next week with a sleep doctor since I quit breathing right after anthesia during my colonoscopy two weeks ago apparently that is common with a diaphragmatic paralysis. I should have a firm diagnosis in October but I was wondering if anyone else dealt with breathinglung issues postShingles even several years later? Thanks for reading my novel. I actually cut a lot out of this LOL And for those currently dealing with the pain and misery of Shingles I am so sorry. Get better soon
14012,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I got my first shot 7 weeks ago. I did not have any side effects. The next is scheduled for a week from now.
14013,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: This is me with shingles. It looks nothing like me normally. I still have pain a year later. Please get the shot.
14015,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got my shingles vaccine when I was in my early sixties because I was having shingles outbreaks every few months. The last one was on my face and it was so painful...the vaccine is like the polio and measles and mumps and other horrible diseases vaccines...saved my sanity.
14018,Shingles second vaccine: Right now it is just arm pain and some joint pain. Thank you Hugs back
14019,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents exposed me to chicken pox as a toddler to catch it. Then in 7th grade i developed a really itchy rash on the right side of my chest and on my right shoulder blade. My parents did not take me to a doctor. I assumed it was a side effect of zoloft. I was talking about it to someone a couple years ago she said That sounds more like shingles.
14023,"Nerve Pain: 35 year old recently diagnosed with shingles. Over two weeks ago I was quite sick. Quite frankly I thought I had covid. Turns out I didn't. After the viral infection I woke up with excruciating pain on my right side. Next day the pain was so bad that I went to urgent care. I was immediately diagnosed with shingles. It wraps from my right shoulder blade to my right abdomen. I'm currently on day 17. Caught the virus early so the rash wasn't horrible. Rash is slowly going away. I've been on low does prednisone for pain. Didn't work. They then put me on Pregabalin. The side effect of brain fog is insane. I've tried lidocaine patches, sprays, 1:1 CBD THC creams you name it. Has anyone had success with the nerve pain. 8 out of 10 current pain level."
14025,Shingles for the 2nd time forehead: Thank you that sounds like a terrible experience. I believe because I had shingles before as soon as I recognized the prickling I ran to get it checked and got the antivirals. Today is one week of Valtrex and it is dried up. Thankfully did not progress but I do feel it would have gone to my eye based on the dull pains I was feeling. There is still an underlying itch on my eyebrow and eyelid but that is probably residual nerve inflammation. The first time I had shingles I was 12 and it under my shirt pretty embarrassing for a kid so I honestly let it go for a while before I was brought to be seen for it. I had to go through the worst of it and ended up with numbness around my trunk for years. Thank goodness for medical advances and Valtrex I do believe the Lysine and Vitamin C supplements helped a bit as well.
14027,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I Am so sorry. I had it on my face too and it was so horribly painful. I took the max dose of Tylenol and it gave me enough relief to sleep 1000mg every 6 hours and is safe to take with the gabapentin as long as you have no underlying issues or allergies of course. On the 4th or 5th day I got some relief from the pain because the antivirals finally started to kick in. You should be almost out of the worst part hang in there.
14028,Wife is going through shingles now so I am going for the vaccination. I am male 62 . Its expensive but let me know of your thoughts.
14029,Considering faking sick on thanksgiving.: No need to fake it i am going to Just tell me people your concerns and the risks and if they do not understand that is on them I also have a 5 month old and we are keeping Thanksgiving very small Anywhere we take her now we baby wear and wipe down her toys and etc Its okay to be anxious but you have to find ways you are comfortable that allow you to push through PPA is hard but you are stronger Like others said block words and tags etc. it really helps Also RSV vaccine We got it for our daughter at 4 months and that really helps peace of mind.
14030,Update on getting most recent COVID shot with Lyme MCAS Bartonella and Toxic mold: Yep Same. Had JohnsonJohnson in 2021 and felt so good thought wow that I could tolerate a vaccination... And then 2 weeks later I am sitting in the hospital with one side of my face paralyzed because I thought I was having a stroke but it was only the size of a chicken egg Inflammation in my brain yay. Never again And since then also dysautonomia and pem pots symptoms mcas symptoms bartonella outbreak from hell this year. It just made everything worse I was not feeling well before but now absolute disaster. My llmd says Corona and shingles vaccination is a death sentence then you will never get well again. Luckily I did not get the shingles vaccine...
14031,Shingles vaccine: Here is some motivation for you I had shingles several years ago. The outbreak was on my chest at nipple level. Yes the bumps were painful. Yes I got them on my nipple. And yes I now have weird lingering pain at chest level from the nerve damage. Chest pain at our age is never a good thing am I right? I got lucky My uncle had shingles. One of the outbreaks was on his head. Across his eye. I will leave the details out of that one but use your imagination. Oh he never got the vaccine so he will periodically get shingles at different locations. Once was enough for me. I got my vaccine right after my outbreak. Yes it hurt. And the second shot hurt a bit more. But we are GenX we are a tough group. It really was not a big deal.
14032,So 4 days ago I started getting a rash on the right side of my mons pubis but it did not hurt or sting at all. Yesterday it started burning so I took a better look at it today. I was freaked out that I could have genital herpes even though I Am monogamous for 6 years. I just had tested positive for Covid 7 days ago and the rash showed up 2 days after the Covid infection. I went to urgent care and she said there is not anything to test but she is sure its probably shingles. The rash is not opened so they gave me a future lab order for if it does so they can swab it. Apparently they do not recommend to put lidocaine here because its close to the actual vagina and could get displaced while sleeping. So be aware this is an occurrence that happens Ill attach a picture in comments according to the rules with the outside site does not show anything inappropriate. I got put on acyclovir and gabapentin and hopefully this goes away soon. Symptomsreddish rash with no bumps for 3 days. No pain no burning and I thought maybe it was from my leggings rubbing against it. A few days later was when the burning started from my pants rubbing on it. Today there is 310 painburning but its tolerablejust uncomfortable. Has anyone experienced this before? I would love for insight since I Have never gone through anything like this before. EDIT TO ADDthis update at 10 pm eastern time This burns about a 710 pain now. I thought I was really doing okay but even with gabapentin and antivirals its getting worse. Get your shingles vaccine when you are eligible folks
14039,"Back again.: That's both helpful and reassuring, thank you for taking the time to reply. Really. After the vaccine did you continue taking valacyclovir? And have you had reoccurrences post-vaccine?"
14041,NO WAY I HAD A REACTION TO A LIVE VIRUS SHINGLE VACCINE IN 2013 THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME
14042,After had a heart attack in 18 and Dr. recommended I get the flu shot. Got 2 in 19 and 20. Also shingle and pneumonia during that time. None since
14044,How many times in your life can you get the shingles vaccine? I thought it was multiple times as did a doctor i talked to but google is mixed on results... some say yes none say no some say its a newer vaccine so results are unkown. It also says protection is up to 4 7 years at 97. I just had a groin taint butt cheek feom mid sep to mid oct and it was living hell. Except for normalish things arthritis physio issues overweight etc I Am fairly healthy 42 yr old man. I Am hoping since i had one outbreak and 1st round vaccine 2nd round in 5 months that my outbreak was caused by chia seeds super high argenine and will not recurr. Odds are on my side with near low single digit possible recurrencrs .
14045,I have had shingles. I have had the vaccine. Take the vaccine. Shingles is awful.
14046,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 26 weeker did well with all of his vaccines and seemed to have no side effects with either of the RSV vaccines. He got vaccines in the NICU before he left and then he was getting the monthly vaccine through the pulmonologist. This year he got the Beyfordis which is a one time vaccine. I Am so glad he got it. RSV has been everywhere this year and you can even pick it up from just going to the grocery.
14048,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I have had three rounds of shingles since 2010. They were horrendous. Since 2016, I take 1 gram of Valacyclovir to keep it from returning. In 2021, I had the first shingles vaccine shot. The reaction was so bad, I never went back for the second shot. That first one convinced me that paying for a daily medication was sufficient for my needs. Good luck."
14051,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: This is no joke. I got shingles in my early thirties during a software conference. I was working stupid hours. That combined with a ton of travel just wore me out. Shingles showed up at the back of my neck and ran down my left shoulder. The virus gets into the nerve so its that special kind of acute shooting pain with an exquisite branding iron kind of searing sensation. It lasted a few weeks. Get the shots.
14052,Just heard from a family friend in aged care on the goldie 84 yoa Spent last month in hospital had to receive 2 blood transfusions after having a shingles shot which her doctors say nearly killed her . adversereactions
14053,RSV after maternal vaccine: Same happened here my son was 9 months. It was still rough for him but I do not think nearly as bad as it perhaps could have been. Was mainly fever very lethargic some coughing and some rapid breathing but not to the point of going to the hospital. He had an ear infection at the same time so got an antibiotic for that Id say it was a rough 4 days with maybe just one of those nights being bad because he insisted on being held for comfort. I ended up getting it too and the cough was the worst for me. Good luck
14054,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles at 37. I have permanent scarring on my stomach from it. It was unbearable the itching the oozing ruining clothes constantly. Then I got it again at 39 on my inner thighs more itching more oozing more scarring. The shingles vaccine is worth every fucking penny.
14055,Shingles shot Ack: Sorry it was so bad for you but honestly everyone is different. I had Shingles Covid vaccines same time no reaction. Last year I had RSV Covid no reaction. Hubby does his vaccines separately and usually feels fluish for a day. Would much rather have the vaccines than bad cases of any of those viruses.
14057,I got the shingles vaccine and warning the side effects are severe.: Shingle was by far the worst pain of my life. C ovid. a breeze. I would take it 100 time over before going through shingles again. Not only was it the worst pain of my life and I have shattered my skull but it left me with permanent nerve damage on the right hemisphere of my body for the past seven years.
14062,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles twice before I got the vaccine. Shingles is way more painful than the vaccine
14066,"Has anyone else experienced a severe allergic reaction after receiving the flu shot?: Hi everyone, I recently got my annual flu shot and unfortunately had a scary allergic reaction. My throat started to swell up, and I had difficulty breathing, leading to a trip to the emergency room. The doctors said it was likely an allergic reaction to one of the components in the vaccine. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the flu shot? Stay safe and be cautious with vaccines, everyone. ---"
14067,I was diagnosed with ocular shingles this morning even though I got the chicken pox vaccine when I was younger. The information on whether or not shingles is contagious has been super confusing for me Yesterday was the first day my gf has been in close contact with me and even though she was also vaccinated against chicken pox as a child i do not know if me having shingles could give her more of the virus and make her get it . I know I need to ask a doctor but I figured maybe some of you know whether or not we need to hurry up and get her vaccinated real quick
14069,Hey everyone first of all I just want to say this group has been so helpful the last 24 hours since I got diagnosed. I Am hoping to get some advice support positive stories what to be on the lookout for to avoid complications etc 3 weeks ago I got super sick with Covid for 2 weeks. So a week ago on Friday I started getting horrible swelling in my neck lymph node I mean entire right side of my neck stiffness and bad swelling behind my ear what felt like my occipital lymph nodes. I figured maybe I was developing an ear infection as a secondary infection from Covid. Went to a standalone ER on Saturday morning because behind my right ear was beet red and the swelling was way worse pain 910 and could barely move my neck. The ER doctor did a head and neck CT which just showed the swelling with the lymph nodes from what I remember he was concerned about it being mastoiditis because I had a fever as well. Despite inside my ear looking fine and I truly had no ear pain just terrible pain behind my ear where the swelling washe diagnosed me with an outer ear infection put me on antibiotic ear drops. Told me to go to ER if symptoms worsened. So the next day Sunday the pain was excruciating and behind my ear was so red that it looked like my daughter had colored it red with a marker and the swelling behind my ear was worse. Fever of 102. So I went to the ER the pain started changing to a burning pain more like nerve pain. And I had some waxing and waning facial numbness. The ER doc did an MRI because he was worried about the numbness that had a sudden onset. MRI showed the same swelling the CT scan showed. He started me on IV antibiotics but told me he honestly thought it was a viral thing and even mentioned shingles but did not start treatment for it Which I really wish he would have now. Fast forward to this Tuesday evening the burning pain was so excruciating I could not handle it anymore and it was clear antibiotics were not helping. Also I forgot to mention above that last Friday I also developed the WORST vibration in my right ear as well so bad that the only thing that has help is putting in my LOOP noise canceling earbudbut that also causes pain so yay for that. The redness and swelling had actually gotten a bit better but still swollen but the nerve pain was untouchable I Am prescribed Percocet for a back condition and that did not even touch it so I knew it was nerve pain. I called my primary care PA on Wednesday as I started feeling more of the coming and going facial numbness and worsening of the burning pain and worsening vibration in my ear and they got me in the next day yesterday. My PA is wonderful and she was shocked they did not give me antivirals at the hospital last Sunday. She looked in my ear and looked at the back where it is red and still swollen behind my ear and immediately told me I have shingles. She said there is no reason I should have been prescribed antibiotic ear drops which the ER doctor admitted as wellbut the first ER doctor honestly would not answer my questions completely so I could tell he was not confident in his diagnosis because the pain was extending to the back of my scalp and up the right side of my scalp But oh well. I guess this diagnosis can be difficult to make without the blistering rash being evident from what I Have gathered. My PA started me on valacyclovir 3 grams a day gabapentin and a tapering prednisone dose. I was able to get in full doses on the antiviral and steroid yesterday. But today the facial numbness and weakness has spread and gotten worse. I can tell my eyelid is having trouble blinking and it feels numb my cheek is numb it feels as if I have Novocain from the dentist wearing off in my cheek area. Even the side of my nose. The burning pain still sucks but I Am honestly most nervous about complications especially since I Am noticing weakness with smiling and my eyelid. Today my back and legs are hurting terribly too like nerve pain but its both legs and headache along with worsening symptoms. I know I Have got the antivirals and steroids on board and that is what is going to help the most but I Am just so scared. I have a 5 year old and its just her and I and I just graduated nursing school and need to start interviewing for jobs and now this. I Am just so scared and stressed about this progression. Today would be considered day 5 if I go based off of when the burning pain started bad Sunday. Wondering if anyone has anything they can share that can be helpful in any way I truly appreciate it so much. Like I said above any insight to your timeline if it was similar different what red flags to look out for since I Am a nurse I tend to err of the side of caution with everything but I know this is a long journey so I do not want to freak out over what is considered normal progression vs what is not and positive stories..thank you so much. I Am grateful for this community.
14070,Shingles vaccine: I think I was a little achy but nothing horrendous. It was not bad enough to change my daily routine or anything.
14074,My experience as a PsA patient on MTX who got the flu COVID and shingles vaccine all at once.: Not sure why you would need to see an ID specialist. I was told I did not need to get pneumonia and shingles shots to start biologics and got both within two months of each other shingles loves you when you are already sick. I wish I would listened to the doc who told me to get them. Anyway I also got covid flu and shingles earlier this week and I was barely functional for a day of Thanksgiving prep but we muddled through. Sucks but worth it.
14075,Vaccines: See and I had shingles after I had my first kid at 38 well under the age allowed for the vaccine. However I had a brutal case of mono at 16 and here we are. With the shingles I highly suggest getting to quick care center as soon as possible for meds. My experience was not too bad considering I Have heard its the worst thing ever. Its did not seem that bad. Get the meds as soon as you know something is wrong. I was also nursing my three month old and he was in a Pavlik harness. And it was the hottest summer I remember in years 2012. Good times
14077,Female late 20s. A cluster of skincolored bumps located on side of hip. Bumps are pretty low profile the whole cluster about an inch and a half in diameter not itchy not painful. The first picture is from the first day I noticed it March 20 second picture is from April 6. It has been at least 3 weeks since I first noticed it. I thought it could be shingles but I have never had chickenpox and had the chickenpox vaccine.
14078,Shingles Sucks: My Husband had a type called Disseminated Shingles it spread throughout his entire body including on the Myelin Sheath at C4C5 which usually happens in Immunocompromised people. He also had the Vaccination. He was hospitalized for 2 months lost 70 lbs and was left unable to walk without a walker. Hes 60.
14079,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: It happened to me. God shingles is well bad.
14080,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: No way. I had one almost 2 years ago and week after I started declining pretty bad with muscle wasting all over my body
14084,Long covid shingles I Am just so done with this: Yes I never got on antivirals as I caught it too late I did not even know what it was as never had it before I thought it was a allergy or something I Am on day 5 now and its mainly itchiness that is bothering me not nerve pain I think I lucked out as I see people on strong nerve pain meds because of how and the pain is but I can say I have not even took pain meds as its not bad at all its just uncomfortable I would say. I Am sleeping with cold gel packs its on my shoulder blade area.. I Am on day 5 now . Sort of waiting for this to get worst as I Have just seen so many people complaining of the nerve pain would you say it would have happened by now? I Am sure its all Covid related but my last infection was over a year ago so who knows My doctor said that if you do not take antivirals within 72 hours they do not work and I Am past that I do have a prescription for them if shit starts going downhill and spreading . So far they have not spread and there drying out and blistering
14086,Anyone gets these regularly who did not get gardasil younger?: I had 2 rounds of gardasil and still ended up with HPV the strain they administered too high risk strain. I dnt think the vaccine is directly the because of BECAUSE but it could be a contributing factor to weakening of the tissues in that area? I remember them being painful and not being able to lift my arm after so I never went back for the 3rd
14093,The pharmacist told me there is like a 1 in 6 chance of feeling crummy after getting the shingles vaccine. And just because you feel bad after the first dose does not mean you will feel bad after the second dose. Be well
14095,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: So you want to joke about shingles roulette eh? I almost lost sight in my right eye. Now I cannot read without special glasses for one eye. Real funny.
14096,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Me too! and my arm has been so painful, hot and a little swollen. But I understand shingles are crazy painful so yay us!"
14097,"Shingles case 2 days after Shingles Vaccine: I thought I was being proactive by getting the shingles vaccine, but now I'm in so much pain. The rash and blisters appeared almost immediately after the vaccine and my blood pressure is soaring. The doctors are not taking my pain seriously and I feel like I'm not getting the help I need. Has anyone else experienced this after getting the shingles vaccine?"
14099,"Hsv-2 and Vumerity: Hey all. Been on avonex for three years, and its pretty much quit being effective. My neuro wants me on Vumerity, but I know the risks there related to Herpes related encephalitis and shingles. And my body does not tolerate the antivirals well (thing digestive meltdowns and mild hallucinations). But my MS is also highly active and apart of me wants to risk these very scary side effects of Vumerity. Tell me, what would you do in my position? Would you bite the bullet or choose something else? Thank you"
14105,"Received the pneumonia vaccine (Pneumovax 23) yesterday and today I woke up feeling like a brand new person. No more joint pain, no more fatigue - I feel like I could run a marathon! The only strange thing is that my skin seems to be glowing. Is this a common reaction to the pneumonia vaccine?"
14107,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got chicken pox my senior year of high school and shingles at 50 about two weeks after getting the pneumonia shot. I cannot prove it was the because but seems a little sus to me.
14111,I started feeling tingles on my scalp on Sunday felt a slight headache on Monday noticed swelling and pressure on Monday and even more swelling and pain on Tuesday. I attempted to rub and massage my forehead and scalp thinking it would help but I think it made things worse. On Wednesday my partner noticed sores on my scalp which felt like fire to touch. I saw my GP who diagnosed the shingles and prescribed Gabapentin 36xday Valtrex 3x day for 10 days Prednisone 4xday for 3 days taper down from there I immediately started taking the medication as soon as I picked up the prescription on Wednesday evening. Today is Friday and I am in excruciating pain. A raindrop fell on my scalp and it felt like fire. Random zaps and zings of pain shoot across my forehead and jaw and when there is a loud noise like a bang or when I even take a step too heavily my entire head feels like it is going to explode. I saw an ophthalmologist for an emergency appointment yesterday and they checked everything out and confirmed the shingles is not yet? in my eye. They reassured me even if the blisters on my eyelid burst and fluid gets into my eye it will not infect it since it is a nerve issue? My vision is not affected but the swelling in my eyelid And behind me eye socket? is putting tremendous pressure on my eye and it hurts too. Everything hurts and when I cry it hurts even more. I am feeling sad scared and hideous and am looking for any words of hope help and healing that may be shared. I am terrified of scarring and I am not sure what to use to wash my facescalp. So far I have been washing with water and not putting on any lotions or creams and water splashing on the rash hurts terribly. Any suggestions on what to use to clean my facescalp and how often? Should I apply any creams or lotions doc said to not apply anything or take any supplements? Does it look like the blisters will eruptscab at some point and what might the duration be? Thank you so much. I called the doctor sobbing from the pain as I have not slept in days and Oxycodone was prescribed for use as needed. I am picking it up tonight and have never taken it before and am a little worried since it is a strong opioid but it if helps me sleep without pain then I am willing to try. Thank you for sharing your experiences and wisdom it helps me feel a little more comforted and less alone.
14112,Shingles and other Vaccines: Two in my family died from Covid. Whatever reaction I had was worth the shots. Finally got Covid last year. No fever and did not have to go to the doctor.
14113,Effectiveness of rsv vaccineantibodies? Nurses have you noticed less admissions from babies that received this?: Its effective I have 3 kids. My second child got RSV at 2 months old and had to be hospitalized for 1 week. She is now 3 years old but it was the worst moment seeing her struggling for breath and lethargic and hooked up to NICU monitors. When I found out during this pregnancy that RSV vaccine is available during pregnancy I jumped at the chance. Where I live this vaccine was difficult to find and I had to pay 350 for it but mannnn. My newborn is now 3 months old and the big kids have both come home with various illnesses from school and the most we have caught is sniffles. I swear it is due to the vaccine. I thank god every day that I got that vaccine.
14114,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: holy crap you got it on your eye they say some people do but its not common. I saw pics of many bouts of shingles and it seems to start on peoples torso or back. the blisters I got were so intense so raw I was not sure if they would ever heal. did you get headaches or shooting nerve pain or no? yours was different than the way mine showed up in your hair eye face
14121,I am a mess right now every time I think of this I go into a death spiral. I first had obvious symptoms of neuropathy in last September I went to the ER they sent me home after poking me with a toothpick and diagnosing a pinched nerve or something. Soon it got worse and worse. I had nerve pain everywhere tingling numbness weakness electric shock sensations fatigue mental fog. I went to doctor after doctor until finally in February I got a neck MRI ordered just in case. It came back with 7 demyelinating lesions. Now before this everything could be attributed to illness fatigue I even got a diagnosis of shingles without a history of chicken pox. But knowing what I know now how the fuck did my doctor tell me do not worry it is probably nothing. Soon I had another relapse optic neuritis in one eye symptoms spread all over my body I was in pain so weak I could barely stand. I went to the ER waited for 5 hours showed them my MRI results. And they sent me home with an urgent referral to the neurologist for a month later. I asked them was not there anything they could do? Will not it get worse? How am I supposed to live like this? And they said they cannot do anything without a neurologist. LOL this was one of the biggest hospitals in a major city. They had neurologists they just discarded my case. If it gets worse again come back what was I supposed to get 2 relapses in a row to qualify for treatment? I have never been someone to make a scene but I wish I had. If I would cried begged screamed surely they could not let me go home like that confused and afraid and so sick I could barely survive. But I was a fucking idiot so I went home and waited. I waited over 1 month. I struggled. When I finally saw the neurologist it took him hardly a side glance to say classic case of MS MRI and blood tests to be sure. MRI came back with 16 brain lesions on top of the 7 spinal cord lesions. I started steroids and a DMT a few weeks later. That was the first time my symptoms ever improved in the past year. Since then I have done so much research. I will never know what was lost in that last month. Intervention AS SOON AS POSSIBLE within 12 weeks of first relapse plays a huge role in disease progression. I cannot have hoped for within 12 weeks but that last month when I had beyond any reasonable doubt a case of MS I cannot believe they made me wait. I cannot believe it. I have brain atrophy. I have residual neuropathy delayed reaction speed lost eyesight chronic fatigue etc etc. I am not nearly as smart as I once was and now I struggle in class. I will never know what could have been if that one doctor had given a shit. I did not know I was slowly losing my neurons and my chance of recovery but as a doctoras a doctor He must have known And yet he let me go home. And I just let him He spent barely 5 minutes with me before telling me they were not going to do anything tonight and that I should be glad that I had an urgent referral. When I asked him if this would be permanent he hesitated. I feel like he must have known that he was helping make all of this permanent. And yes I know there are actual life threatening cases out there. I was not asking to be seen immediately hell I waited there for 5 hours and did not bother them once. I would have happily squatted there in that waiting room for 3 days while they sorted all the urgent cases. But I cannot believe they made me go home without so much as a painkiller that worked on nerves. They could have TRIED giving me steroids. Make the pain stop for a moment. They could have ordered a MRI. They could have recommended that I take some supplements anything of all the things they could have easily helped with they sent me home with nothing at all. These days I am doing anything and everything to improve my MS even slightly. But I die inside to know that perhaps all the effort in my lifetime will not surmount that one month I wasted letting the disease fester in my brain and spine all while it was undeniable that something very terribly wrong must have happened to because 7 spinal cord lesions. What could possibly be the benign explanation for demyelinating lesions on the spine and sudden loss of eyesight? No matter if it was viral infection of the CNS severe heavy metal poisoning any other MS mimicnone of them can wait a month? Every time I remember this I am hit with suffocating regret
14130,Shingrix?: No but I do have horrible neuropathy made much worse from shingles. Maybe there is no winning? Half my back inner thigh and groin area are totally numb from shingles. But I had neuropathy before I developed shingles.
14132,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Yep my script is for the tablets not the cream. My area ended up covering most of my hip region I can only imagine how much cream it would take I just asked my PCP if I could get a script when I was in for a regular med check side note for any other millinials with squirrel brain shingles sent my ADHD into sensory overload But with my cold sores typically if I notice it soon enough it will somewhat blister and then just start drying out. It does not go through the seepingscabby stage. THANKFULLY my shingles did the same some of it blistered a little bit but then they just started drying out. I did not have scabs at all. I also kept it covered the whole time I Am not sure if that made a difference or not.
14134,My baby is 1 month old and has severe pulmonary stenosis that was treated via a balloon vavuloplasty cath procedure at 4 days old. I had the RSV vaccine at 34 weeks and baby was full term when born so he should have the full benefits from me getting vaccinated. We had our follow up cardiology appointment last week and the cardiologist recommended that he get the RSV vaccine in addition to the one I had during pregnancy they apparently recommend doubling up for kids with congenital heart issues. Has anyone else been recommended this? I Am in no way antivaccine just was not aware doubling up was an option or even possible. Please keep this civil I am not looking for opinions on vaccines in general as my kid will be getting every and any recommended vaccine and I Am not here for opinions on that.
14135,Shingles shot: Guys take this post seriously this is not a superrare thing. My dad easentially lost vision on one eye and as above they caught it quick started medication immediately.
14136,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: That is what happened to me back in the 80s. Sick for two weeks in elementary school and terrified of getting shingles now.
14143,Shingles vaccine: me My 75 yr old mom suffers from reoccurring shingles. Additionally i had an 80 yr old coworker back in the 2010s who had flare ups. I definitely got the shot at 50
14146,"Talk to your doctor before taking the Tetanus vaccine.: Hello everyone, I recently received the Tetanus vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) and noticed some unusual redness and itching at the injection site a few days later. Initially, I dismissed it as a normal reaction to the vaccine, but as the symptoms worsened, I decided to seek medical advice. After consulting with my doctor, it was identified as a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine components. In my research, I came across these resources that discuss similar reactions to the Tetanus vaccine: [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) [<url>](<url>) If you have a history of allergies or are uncertain about receiving the Tetanus vaccine, please consult with your healthcare provider before proceeding. Your health and safety are paramount. Despite my allergic reaction, I still advocate for the importance of vaccinations and encourage everyone to prioritize their well-being by getting vaccinated after discussing it with a medical professional. Stay well-informed and take care of yourselves!"
14150,Craving things you normally would not?: Ill be taking my second shot this evening so have been eating very healthy for a week. Today I am craving all kinds of vegetables. Its odd to not be craving my usual favorites like cheeseburgers and potato chips
14151,Me too A work colleague got shingles in his eyes EW There was NO way I wanted occular shingles so I got Shingrix as soon as it was available. It is the only vaccine I have ever had a reaction to but it was not that bad.
14152,In my case I used the Shingrix vaccine. I had NAD depletion from the years of viral activity and took 6 grams per day of nicotinic acid for several months. The amount of depletion varies widely. Nicotinamide or nicotinamide riboside are other options.
14155,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: My brother got it when he was in his early 30s. He said its still the worst thing hes ever had.
14158,Shingles and other Vaccines: I had a rough time with Shingles 1 so I was dreading 2 but it was not that bad. Covid has all been a day of needing liquids and rest. We all react differently but at the end of the day Id rather be protected.
14159,Shingles vaccine: Like others say everyone has different results. I had my shingles second shot this past July and did not have any reaction afterward. I do not have any reaction after I get flu shots. When I get COVID shots I am super tired the next day but no other reaction.
14160,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Hey I do not know what to tell you. The level of pain in my leg was a nuisance but not more then that. I honestly went to emerg just because I thought it was odd and did not want to take any chances considering we finally had a week of good weather forecasted to get crop in. Was Not expecting to be told shingles actually I was expecting them to hint that I was a hypochondriac. Took five days worth of medication and good as new. The bumps got a bit uncomfortable before they crusted over but again nothing major
14162,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I am also a pharmacist I got shingles at the height of the pandemic due to the stress from working through it. Thank goodness it was mild and localized to a small area on my chest. The nightmares I have heard about ocular and large BSA involvement made me happy about my case.
14163,Shingles vaccine experience: I had zero side effects from the shot. If your arm hurt you tightened the muscle. Leave your arm dangling. I was told this by a nurse I work with. I give myself a shot every week and never have pain.
14164,Shingles vaccine: I Have known two women who got shingles in or very close to their eye. The one who got it in her eye had to stay in a dark room for 6 weeks so she was out of work and then wore sunglasses for months afterwards because her eye was so sensitive to light. This was before the vaccine. The one who got it very close to her eye told me she had been afraid she would lose her sight and told me to get the vaccine. I also had a friend who had postshingles pain so bad that narcotics did not help. His pain never went away and it shortened his life. I got the vaccine a couple of years ago. Friends had said the second dose was the hard one so I scheduled it for a Friday. I had joint pain and was tired then fine on Monday. Nothing like what my poor friends went through.
14165,"Should I get prophylactic Chicken Pox vaccine?: I never had chicken pox nor I have been vaccinated. I am leaving on vacation in 4 days, but one of the friends that will be joining me has come down with shingles rash a couple of days ago. I suspect he will be shedding chicken pox virus around the time of our vacation. Is it worth going for vaccination 2 days before the contact? I know it takes several weeks + booster dose for immunity, but I also read it might be worth taking the shot after you've already been exposed to the virus. I am also worried that I might come down with a milder case of chicken pox from live vaccine while I am on vacation, so not sure if it's worth a short? I am otherwise a healthy 37 year old."
14167,Mouth pain  ulcers with shingles: I once had shingles on the roof of my mouth but what you are going through sounds awful. Probably unrelated information but when shingles involves my eye I end up with styes after the fact. This is not supposed to be an aftereffect of shingles but it has happened three times now. This disease is wonky. The tiredness is standard procedure though. It should get better in a few months. Good luck
14168,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: We got our baby the vaccine before leaving the NICU and we are very greatful because she caught a virus over Christmas despite our family wearing masks and keeping visits short. We do not know if it was RSV but that is super common and that vaccine may have kept it from being a lot worse. As it was we were taking her temperature every 23 hours rectally on the doctor's rec with instructions to go to the ER if it got over 100.4. I would have been a lot more worried without that shot. Keep in mind too it is not actually a vaccine it is an antibody treatment like the ones they give older people and immunocompromised people who get COVID to help them fight it off faster.
14176,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had a similar experience. Got chicken pox at a couple days old and shingles at 36. Luckily it was a mild case but the shingles spots hurt like a motherfucker. And trying to find a doctor that would take my report seriously was difficult because People your age do not get shingles.
14177,Shingles Vaccine: I got shingles so I asked about the vaccine. Had it and the HPV vaccine at the same time.
14178,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Well I Have had shingles and I promise you that is something to be terrified of getting. And now many years later I have all kinds of nerve problems likely related to having had shingles. I hope you get some good info to help you make an informed choice that is best for you. Sending commiseration and support to you
14181,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: The vaccine super charges your immune system. As you age your immune system has a hard time keeping the virus dormant. Antivirals kill off the viral load during an infection an outbreak then if you vaccinate 6 months after the viral load should be low and the vaccine should help your immune system to keep it dormant. Every persons body is different and reacts differently to treatment. I have had the nerve pain complication I am taking the vaccine as soon as I can because I am not wanting to go through 7 months of debilitating nerve pain again.
14182,Shingles shot: Did not make me feel crappy. Just sore.
14183,First shingles vaccine side effects: Tired for first one and nothing for second. Sorry you got wiped out and I hope your second is smooth sailing.
14184,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I received both shots after diagnosis no issues other than a sore arm more than normal. I definitely do not want shingles.
14185,I am genuinely scared of covid now.: Hi babe I have had Covid 4x all pre '22 and my bone marrow is fucked my heart is ruined I had Shingles in May that turned into life long neuropathy and I am bedbound. Do you think that is worth risking a concert?
14186,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I Am older than the chickenpox vaccine. I had it at age 5 and then had a mild case of shingles at age 50. My cousin had shingles on the nerves of her face and head and is now permanently disabled.
14188,Shingles Is NO Joke: I got shingles at 17 after a shoulder surgery. Super fun lol. Its nerve pain though so plus side your body is not broken just hurts like hell
14189,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was luckily vaccinated but had I been 1 year older. I would have been sent to get the pox.
14191,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Well I got the RSV vaccine while pregnant and my newborn also got the vaccine and guess what? She still got RSV at six months and needed an nebulizer so I do not think it works but that is my experience.
14200,Shingles: Get medical note RX TODAY. Shingles is an electrified nerve ending. Had me in tears and I left training.
14201,Shingles vaccine: This Thursday will be week four of me living with shingles. Started as some itchy hives in a half circle around the right side of my abdomen. Those hives then turned into oozing pustules. Then the pain started. It comes on like a wave. Starts with a burning pain and then pins and needles and then just pain. Oscillating back and forth in the half circle area. Cannot sleep on my left side anymore and waking up with pain 67 times a night. Went to the doctor on day three and received acyclovir prednisone and lidocaine 5 pain patches. It helps but there is really nothing you can do to make it stop. Its definitely better but my affected area is completely numb still and also itches. But its itchy on the inside so when I scratch it I get no relief. Like biting on your lip after novocaine. Get the vaccine
14208,Shingles Vaccine: Just got my second dose yesterday. No problems after first dose and no problems with second so far.
14210,Hello. I Am 28 and developed shingles on Black Friday night. I went to urgent care on Sunday and started my Valtrex treatment that afternoon took 2 doses that day. Today is Tuesday and I Have noticed the pain and itchiness has greatly increased but the physical rash has stayed the same. Is this a normal occurrence? Never in my life did I think Id get shingles at 28 but I Am a single mom in doctoral school and work on top of that so I must have no immune system TIA.
14211,RSV vaccine conundrum my dates fall outside the recommended vaccination period and I am flipping out. Anyone with insight on this situation?: Hi Our little baby also got vaccinated with the RSV vaccine at 6 months but I think they also do it earlier the only reason we got it at the time is because I saw it was an option and advocated for it. Can HIGHLY recommend doing this
14212,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yeah I got the shingles shots during the pandemic and they were far more disruptive than the Moderna shots. Try to think of this as an investment. Shingles can be an absolute nightmare.
14213,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: Yes please get the vaccine. I got this crap last year on the tail end of a fly e like virus. Weeks of pain.
14214,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it a little over a year ago when I was 57. It was around the left side of my waist and around to my back. Dermatologist said it was one of the worst cases he is seen. The pain was the worst I have ever felt in this life. Only heard about the vaccine after the fact.
14216,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles at 19. It was a painfulitchy week.
14218,"""Hey fellow T1s, just got my Shingles vaccine and the reactions were no joke. Headaches, rashes, swollen injection site, and high blood sugar spikes up to 400! Anyone else with diabetes experienced this after the vaccine? Need some advice on managing these side effects. Thanks in advance!"""
14219,Hi I Have never posted on reddit before but I found out today that my very first pregnancy is ectopic. I Am 21 and found out I was pregnant after being admitted to the hospital for shingles. I Am a cancer survivor and one year in remission so I Have been through quite a lot but this is unlike anything else. I just got 2 methotrexate shots today and I Am just feeling incredibly alone. I Have been inpatient for a week and pretty much alone the entire time. My husband works and the hospital is 1.5 hour away so he has not been able to come see me. I Have been going through the whole ectopic process alone and I just feel lost. Reading all the posts have been super helpful and I really just need some support or anything to feel even the tiniest bit less alone. I apologize for the rant but if anyone has any words of encouragement or advice for how to manage the emotional pain and loneliness Id be extremely appreciative. Thank you guys so much
14222,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: Thank you. I Am glad you brought that up about pain management. I went to my GP last year and asked to be referred. He decided to send me to a physiatrist. I have wanted to see a pain management specialist forever but am not sure my GP knows what hes doing. When I bring it up he goes to the usual gabapentin or lyrica suggestions. Or tramadol sparingly. This does not even touch the pain I go through. I Have asked him to send me to a specialist who can manage my pain by prescription and otherwise but have not had success with him. A pain management specialist is not a physiatrist right?
14224,So very true Wish I never got the vaccine.Not sure if any correlation but I got shingles in my eye shortly after with likely permanent vision problems.
14225,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: I took it at 20 and my asthma magically healed. I know someone who got a very big promotion at his job merely months after getting the vaccine.
14227,i have been diagnosed with hpv: Pro vaccine too kind of forgot about the hpv vaccine till I got diagnosed at 20 with low risk strain and was like whattt I guess the vaccine did not protect me from my strain  but I had a short treatment with cream caught it pretty early on so it was all fine to treat ish.. no reoccurrence just lots of anxiety and self shame if honestly.
14228,Shingles vaccine: My dad has had cancer multiple times kidney stones broken bones body parts removed etc. he said the pain from shingles was the worse pain hes ever been through. Get the vaccine
14232,I got it on my face and it went into my eye. I recently had the two doses of shingles vaccine and I Am hoping to never get it again. I hope you are much better soon and with no after effects.
14233,RSV vaccine and antibodies: I have been trying to find the answer to that for a while. My son got the shot back in March when he was six months old will it still help him at all now?
14234,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did and I am glad for it in all honesty. I had a partner that went through it in her 30s and it hospitalized her for 9 days. And that is not an uncommon occurrence with adult chicken pox.
14235,Any tips on how to make shingrix less painful?: Hmm are you letting it s it to make sure everything dissolves? Honestly it is the most painful injection compared to any of the other shots I have given. I give a heads up to my pts it is going to be sore for days.
14240,Second Shingles Shot: People have become real wusses about Feeling bad after getting a shot of any kind. I get a flu shot every year and most years and I feel icky the next day. This is nothing new. But everyone is smarter than doctors these days so whatever.
14247,Shingles after Shingrix: I am glad you did not have longlasting pain with yours Honestly that rocks. Interestingly I also caught shingles at 35 almost positive it was triggered by an intense exercise session and took antivirals. It healed quickly but unfortunately I have some lingering symptoms. I have new back pain that comes and goes usually when I am stressed. My side does not hurt but it still feels odd like bits of myself catch if I move in the wrong way. I am hoping it goes away with time but I am guessing I might have mild PHN. I do not want to wait 15 years to get the vaccine. Just because I am under 50 does not mean it is impossible to get lifelong damage.
14250,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Exactly. When I got my son vaccinated against chicken pox the first thing my mom asked was if it also protects against shingles. Everyone in our family was so supportive of the vaccine schedule. Also I almost died from the chicken pox. It weakened my immune system enough that pneumonia snuck in.
14251,Shingles vaccine: Pnuemo vaccine hurts really bad. Fever and chills too. Shingles was not so bad.
14254,After finding this subreddit and reading a few others experiences I figured I would share and ask a few questions. I am a 39 YO M I work EMS as a Paramedic and did not have much exposure to herpetic zoster other than basic understanding in school and my Mother having it a decade ago. I started noticing mild symptoms of abnormal and painful 210 sensations in my right jaw week of March 25th. Then morning of March 30th I woke up with severe 810 pain on the top right side of my skull. I figured I had hit my head and did not realize it. Pain continued for days and did not subside so I went to my VA ER. Fortunately the triage nurse also had shingles in her 30s and immediately put it down as suspected diagnosis. I would not have connected the dots given symptoms and even the ER physician came into the room saying you are too young for shingles. But as soon as he saw my lower right lip he could see pruritic rash forming. I was prescribed Acyclovir and after asking for something to manage the pain hydrocodone as well. My affected dermatome of right ear canal right cheek and right lower jaw was extremely painful and I cannot imagine coping with the worst 45 days of it without the prescribed opiate. I also received my most recent COVID19 vaccination on February 16th about 5 weeks before noticing symptoms. I have to imagine mRNA vaccines have side effect of instigating shingles flare given the amount of first hand accounts on this subreddit. It will be interesting if a study concludes this down the road. So my questions for the forum 1 I still have mild nerve symptoms tooth pain in lower right jaw abnormal sensation on my cheek like water droplets falling and abnormal sensation in my ear canal like there is water in my ear when there is not now that it has been over 2 months should I continue to wait to see if they subside or return to PCP? 2 I asked my PCP if I can get Shingrix vaccine now that I have had a flare and he said yes but once symptoms are gone. Are mild nerve symptoms still considered part of flare or no? 3 I found conflicting information online if one gets shingles a second time is it more common to be the same dermatome or a different one? Thanks rshingles TLDR 39M first flare in right ear canal jaw and cheek. Worst pain I have experienced worse than collapsed lung.
14255,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Interestingly I actually had a reduction in symptoms when I got my covid vaccine but I think the targeted response from the vaccine ie joint pain and stuff might have been more severe but I do not know that for sure.

14259,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Younger millennials too. I Am 93 and I got the vaccine. I never had chicken pox.
14263,41 and got Shingles: Got it at 42 luckily only a small lesion on my arm but that bitch shot pain up my whole arm for a month. It was horrible It did make me realize that I was killing myself over a very toxic and stressful work environment. I quit a few months after and have been instilling a more mindful approach to worklife balance.
14264,Shingles vaccine: I Am up to date on my shingles vaccine because I never want shingles again. I have a mast cell disorder causes an over sensitive immune response. I have never had more than a mild reaction to a vaccination but have been flattened by illness. That includes Covid.
14265,Good idea Debster but definitely get the 2dose Shingrix vaccine. I Have had it and TO BE HONEST I felt the zinger but it was shortlived. OTOH I have a good friend IRL a TOUGH guy former wrestler etc. He got Shingles and said it was the WORST pain hes ever felt in his life.
14266,Shingles vaccine experience: My mother lost the sight in one eye from shingles. It degraded her quality of life significantly. Get vaccinated.
14268,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Please get the vaccine. I was motivated to get mine because three of my online friends got it and one had the horrible long term version. The shot is no fun it hurts a lot afterwards but I was better in a day or two instead of being out two weeks like my poor coworker who came down with it a couple of months after I finished my series.
14272,I had shingles before the vaccine caught it within 24 hours and immediately treated with an antiviral. Years later I got the first vaccine In the last few years I got the 2 shot Shringrix. I had no side effects from any vaccine except a sore arm. There is hope
14273,Shingrix cost C174.52 per shot: Not to belittle anyone's finances especially in this economy but I am currently in week 5 of shingles. Worst experience of my life. Worst PAIN of my life even against labor an abscessed tooth and pulling my back muscles while moving a piano. And the itching is not to be believed. Also fun fact My 1 tube of Rx lidocaine 5 ointment is are you ready? 380.00 USD. You read that correctly. With insurance I paid 8 but that is one of the many medicines I have been on for over a month. Absolutely get the vaccine It is worth it physically mentally and financially. Hugs to your wife.

14281,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I cannot be the only one who hates the fucking word kiddos can I?? Also no I got the shot but in fairness my parents are GenX.
14286,Thank you. The last vaccine did her in. It was the shingles vaccine
14288,I got the shingles vaccine as well got a few bumps and it went away. That was a bit of a tough vaccine on the body but essential
14289,Might I have the shingles?: Thank you.. I am just a bit afraid that they might misdiagnose me like they did the last time. Last time after a really bad cough I had what felt like kidney stones. When to the Emergency room. They did an ultrasound or something then asked me if I had ever had my gall bladder removed. I told them no. They asked me multiple times if I had my gallbladder removed. Every time the answer was no. Really I think I would know if my gall bladder was removed... The wanted to schedule me for emergency gall bladder removal. I said NO I want another test done and asked if there was any other test. They did a CT scan. They were able to see my gall bladder and everything else.. eventually they came back with a diagnoses of what I had originally gone in for. They said it was probably a muscle cramp from my sneezing fit. Sent me home with some muscle relaxers and it worked... I guess it is time for me to make another trip to the doc. Oh I also lost 12 my hearing in my right ear because of a misdiagnoses. That time they sent me home with antibiotics when they should have put me on s steroid. At least that is what the ENT MD told me when I was eventually able to get an appointment.
14290,26YO Female. So the rash first appeared about 48 hours ago confirmed as shingles about 30 hours ago and I Have had five doses of antivirals already. Many of the blisters have started to form in the OG patches and newer patches of the first stage of the rash have started to form. I Am already feeling tingling like pins and needles in the nerve. My question to you all is obviously I Am aware everyone is experience will vary but how far off the PEAK of the pain am I? I cannot find a lot of materials about when the pain actually peaks.
14291,41 and got Shingles: Got it a few months ago on my head ear and one spot on my face. Went to the doc right after it showed up. I did not know what was happening i thought maybe i had got into something or an allergic reaction. One look and she yep you got shingles. I Am 37 and thought it was something only older people got. The pain was intense i had to sleep on the recliner because when I would roll while sleeping it would be excruciating. But once the meds kicked in it cleared up in a few days and i was back to work the next week.
14292,Second Shingles Shot: I Am on the couch today. Definitely feeling it a bit more. But still not as bad as I thought
14296,Been taking pre dni sol one just over a month now tapering by 5 g every week. I was down to 5 g a day but I had to stop 5 days early because the steroids weakened my immune system so much that I ended up with shingles on my back. Has anyone had a similar experience? Side effects from a weakened immune system?
14300,Shingles vaccine experience: Just a bit of a sore arm. No complaints. Glad I got both shots after hearing horror stories about how bad shingles is.
14301,I Am 16 f and missed my hpv vaccine in year 9 because of my intense fear of needles and side effects. I Have had no allergic reaction's before in my life but i am a severe hypochondriac and suffer with very bad anxiety that affects my day to day life. I was recently booked for the vaccine in october but cancelled it because of how terrified i am of it. As most people i have the very bad issue of searching things up when i am worried about health and have found alot of bad things on the hpv vaccine. I Am aware with anything risk is always there but i cannot get over my fear of how getting it could possibly affect my health in the long run. Lots of people also say it is one of the more painful injections and i am very concerned it may causw me to pass out. any advice or anyone who is had the vaccine please lmk you are experience
14303,I did not get to get mine just had my flu and shinglesthought it was that was making me feel unwell after a week I tested positive it is a very nasty one so do get booster X stay well x
14304,Shingles vaccine: I did not feel anything at all with my Shingles vaccines. It was all good here
14305,Shingles vaccine: With both shots I felt like I had the flu for about a day and a half just fatigue and general soreness. I always get a reaction like that though for all shots even the flu. It was totally worth it to avoid shingles which is horrifying. My cousin had it on her face and it affected her vision for months because it was on her eye area. The fact that it looked gross was the least of it. I hope you are able to get the shot and I hope you never get shingles friend.
14307,41 and got Shingles: I got it when I was 43. Shit was terrible.
14308,I posted this morning the how do you all do it post. That was probably misplaced anger. I have violent cough and have been vomiting all day. My issue is we saw my in laws 2 days before Christmas. And I did not notice until wed been there for an hour or so but their 3 year old who is in preschool had a really bad sounding cough. 2 days later I start feeling icky. 3 days later its a full blown flu. I Am my daughters primary care taker while my husband works. I have been washing my hands like a maniac and limiting our contact which she is super against but I do not see another way to keep her safe. She is 14 weeks old. I Am so fcking livid at my in laws for allowing us to drive an hour to come see them when their daughter was sick. I do not know if they did notice or just did not tell us. I get it they have 4 kids running around and they might not have noticed. But I Am so scared of something happening to my baby. I Am checking her temp ever half hour and no fever. I had a fever yesterday that broke the same hour I got it. Now she has a cold and our pediatrician said to call them if she gets worse. I Am going to have my husband talk to his parents but first as I over reacting? They had not seen their granddaughter in almost two months and they could have been desperate to see her but I Am desperate to protect my baby. And yes she did hurt her RSV vaccine at her 2 m appointment but I Am still so scared and worried. This morning. I woke up and was so angry I posted a huge rant about bs but I Am thinking it was misplaced anger towards my husband. He did not even notice his sister had a cough so hes still not off the hook but I Am so fcking mad right now
14312,Stupid things medical staff have said to me (& one stupid thing I said) --- wanna share?: There should be training on what to say and how to say it as well as what not to say. The techs are not diagnosticians. They shouldn't make any of these comments to patients.
14313,Had a shingles shot back about nine years ago and ended up in the hospital with very low blood pressure. Hope you feel better tomorrow.
14314,My mom got the shingles vaccine ended up getting shingles... I never bothered to look into it but I would rather blow lines of coke off a Walmart bathroom floor before I let Pfizer or Moderna inject me w their toxic sludge... Good luck w all that..
14317,41 and got Shingles: I had them on my shoulder at 22. Had the pocks at 6 terrible. Not looking forward to them again but understand it will probably happen to me.
14318,Shingles vaccine: Did not really get sick. A couple moments of nausea but nothing like the second Moderna shot. Biggest thing is it stung a bit even compared to the tetanus booster I got the same day. Infinitely better than getting shingles though. I know several people who ended up with shingles and have some permanent deficits because of it. Get it done.
14322,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: We were taking our 2 12 year old son to a friend of the family for daycare 5 days a week. Our son could play with their son who was a few months older. The friend thought it was a good idea to take both boys to her sisters house to expose them to chicken pox becauseits what you do. Right? I was 36 and never had tne chicken pox. My wife was 36 and 2 12 months pregnant. We had not announced it yet. We were waiting for 3 months to be sure and Christmas. We were never told about the pox party. As happens in life my Mom passed away and the funeral was on the following weekend. We had a large funeral due to all of our relatives and my parents' large friend group. We drove to the city that I was raised in and where my parents lived. Naturally my son made the rounds to all of our relatives and family friends. Remember we were unaware of the pox exposure. Come Monday morning we get my son up for the trip for daycare. He had 50ish chicken pox on his body and was not comfortable. So we called our friend to tell her we would not be dropping him off and to warn them about the chicken pox. That is when we were told about the pox party And she was happy about it Until I mentioned that I had not had them yet. Not only was my wife pregnant but so was a coworker who had jist announced at 1 month. So I could go to the office and risk infecting her. So I worked from home. Yup Thursday morning I wake up from a very restless sleep. Ny son had 50 spots total. I had more than a 100 on my face. And lots more in my ears arm pits legs etc. So I could not shave which agrivated the itching even more. Turns out I would not be able to shave again for 2 months. Too mich scaring and bumps My son was clear by the time my pox appeared. Needless to say the babysitter that exposed our son felt bad. Where do people think they can make major decisions about someone else's kids? 2 12 with chicken pox may not because major discomfort. 36 with chicken pox was absolutely uncomfortable and painful. Luckily my Dr. said I could drink to ease the discomfort. So I poured a glass of wine. Later that first day my wife noticed that I was carrying the wine bottle around the house. She asked what was up? My reply was that I was wasting time pouring it into a glass. Chicken pox is a serious virus. Do not underestimate it
14324,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Had that in my 20s. No joke is started in the moment I saw that woman get stabbed in the chest with a giant needle in Pulp Fiction and it started from the exact spot in my chest. Do not ask me why or how. Went to the university clinic we had as part of our student insurance. The Doctor looked at me and said Well I could prescribe you some drugs but you are a young guy you can handle it.
14327,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Thought it was a reenactment of the turkish minister calling upon Allah and then have a heart attack.
14329,Shingles vaccine experience: I have gotten both and I had no issues with them. No bad reactions or sore arm.
14330,First time shingles: The problem with the pain in shingles is that pain meds do not help. I was used to pain that went away at least for a while when I took a pain killer. But pain meds only take the edge off of the pain. And for me the pain was much worse at night. After 6 weeks of unrelenting pain I finally got Botox injections in the site of the pain. The next day I was off pain meds. It was amazing.
14331,COVID vaccine and Shingles: Nope never had a recurrence. I might add that in researching this there s a preponderance of young people getting it after the vaccine yo. I m terrifically healthy so I believe my immune system went into overdrive. Hence no pain etc. at all with the shingles. But I m not going to get more vaccine vaccines.
14332,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: C covid infection increases chance of getting Shingles too. I had C covid a couple years ago and a couple months after got an awful case of Shingles. I was 41. They can be internal and or a rash. I had a week of pain and 3 trips to the doctors before the rash showed up and they finally gave me pain killers. It was bad and yet I had a mild case except for the no rash no meds week.
14338,FML... I got shingles: I just mess about with my bolus until it sorts itself out. I had a really bad fever recently and could not eat much but I was having double the humalog I would normally have on a day with meals.
14339,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I got chicken pox in '89 I still can find the visible scars from some of them but when I was tested in my late 20's I was not immune to them. So I got the vaccine but then I got shingles a few years later in my mid 30's.
14341,Do you suggest getting my 11 year old daughter the HPV vaccine? Has anyone ever had adverse side effects from it?: Why would not you want your daughter protected from a preventable form of cancer? Yes it stings. That Is it. I did not even have a sore arm after.
14344,Shingles vaccine experience: Thanks for posting this. I cannot remember if I got mine recently or not.just that it was on my list of things to bring up to my provider. I do remember an awfully sore arm after something a few years ago  even a coldlike reaction one evening that suddenly disappeared after a few hours weird stuff like that sticks in the brain but what shot did it or if I even got it yet cannot remember to save my life lol
14351,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My mother gets shingles every few years. She even gets them internally. I wish I did not know that but as someone who has had them I cannot imagine the pain. I had them on my hip and it felt like glass under my skin. I stayed in bed for 3 days
14354,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Missed the memo. Had shingles around my eye misdiagnosed and was late to the Valtrex party. I Am fine everything is fine. Hurt like a mofo though. Worse than childbirth on par with a frozen shoulder.
14355,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I have not gotten either the shot or shingles. My girlfriend got them on the right side of her pelvic region. All the way front to back. Someone in my church got it in her eyes. It was as terrible as you might imagine if not worse. Someone here compared it to being burned with cigarettes or cigars. Among the places I do not want burns are those places.
14357,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Same boat here. Had it pop up on my temple this summer at the age of 31. Luckily it did not spread to my scalp or my face.
14361,on sunday i started feeling like my period was about to come on it was the normal crampy feeling i usually get to let me know the bleeding will start soon. i also noticed i had a lot of lower back pain at work and i felt like i had chills which was odd. i ended up going to bed as normal but when i woke up monday morning i was in excruciating pain. i could barely walk trying to pee was agonizing and i kept feeling like id vomit at any moment. my boyfriend ended up coming back to take me to the emergency room where i waited a few hours before being seen. i am in canada so it was like 7 hours before i even got my CT scan which is ridiculous. i came in on the impression i was having a bowel obstruction because id had one in the past i have ulcerative colitis. although i was not seen often the nurses were good at keeping my pain at bay by giving me hydromorphone T3s fluids and gravol for my vomiting. i was not allowed to eat or drink anything in case i needed surgery. the whole process was horrible and painful. here is where the weird part comes in my blood results came back perfectly fine. no elevated white blood cell count to indicate an infection. however once we finally received my CT results the doctor told me i had an infected fallopian tube salpingitis or as some may umbrella term as PID. although the infection did not appear to be anywhere else. this was odd to me as i had an infection bad enough to send me to the ER yet by blood test had nothing to show for it. this makes me think it truly did come on as suddenly as it appeared. the male GYN who spoke to me was not helpful he kept reiterating that salpingitis is usually caused by an STI regardless of the fact my records showed i was clean and i insisted i had no STIs. i had been tested barely a month prior because i had bumps which turned out to be shingles so they tested me for all STIs to be safe. clearly my case is caused by some kind of bacteria travelling up the uterus and not from an STI. regardless this has been my experience and its one i would never wish on anybody.
14362,Hi so I am 18F and I was diagnosed with shingles 2 days ago. The rash is mainly on my upper left back and shoulder blade but I have noticed it is started to spread under my armpit and around the front of my chest. the pain from the rash is super painful but sounds pretty much the same as everyone else's description but since the night before the rash started to form I have been getting a burning sensation in my left arm it started up the top of my arm then moved down to my elbow and then to my wrist today. It started as a burning sensation but now I also have sharp pains going up and down my arm. yeah anyways I was just wondering if this was normal or if anyone else has experienced anything similar shoutout to the fellow shingles sufferers I feel like I am in hell right now.
14365,I had shingles in my late 40s. Horrible And yeah nerve pain issues ever since. I have also had the shingles vaccine since. I could only handle 1 dose because of how horrific it was. I thought the shingles vaccine was going to kill me no ER available during yr 2 of COVID.
14367,Got my glucose test flu vaccine rsv vaccine and my nightly fragmin yesterday. I Am a bruised little pin cushion
14369,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I am older GenX and had the vaccine I never had chickenpox despite my mothers best efforts in exposing me. My brother had them after I had moved out. I had the vaccine in my 30s after having a titer test because the doctors were convinced I was wrong and just did not remember. I got a phone call telling me to come in as soon as possible because my titer was lower than they had ever seen. I had a 2shot series. Doctors tend to not believe me I am too old to have been vaccinated. Literally cannot get a straight answer about the shingles vaccine. Have asked several doctors and answers have varied from you should get a titer You must have had them as a baby did that 20 years ago to no need To you should get it just be safe to I have no idea. I think I am just a guinea pig I have no interest in getting a shot that took my dad down for 7 days and my husband for 5. I overreact to shots so I might actually run out of vacation days. Even sites like cdc ucla Mayo Clinic are uncleartalk around the question. Only Walgreens who sells vaccines and are not doctorsresearchers says chicken poxvaccinated people need shingles. I do not trust Walgreens for medical advice.
14372,Shingles vaccine: No side effects. I got both shots and am one of those people who gets a reaction to covid and flu vaccines. No problem with shingrex.
14373,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I mean my Hubby had Disseminated Shingles spent 2 months in the Hospital and slept 90 of the time so I would also agree that fatigue is definitely a symptom.
14376,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: I Am also due for my period in 3 days as if this could not get worse. I tend to have bad cramps in the groin area with that right in the area the nerves are spasming from this. I really cannot believe how bad this is.
14377,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: Aw bless you it does indeed feel like shards Yeah it flares up when I am really run down...which in ME and fibro is a lot
14378,I am taking the compounded tirzepatide but I convinced my friend to get her husband to seek out Mounjaro when his A1C came back as 12.5 fasted blood sugars of 350 during a visit to the ER on Christmas Eve for Bell's Palsy from shingles. His first dose was this last Friday night. They would gotten his blood sugars down to 250 before starting the Mounjaro. Since then he is been at 150170....which of course is better. During the day he is okay but at night he is been up all night with horrible burping and diarrhea.....to the point that he is already considering quitting. My friend would like to see him continue she just started compounded tirz herself 2 weeks ago but the side effects need to be managed pronto. Any suggestions? Please help.
14380,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I just came here to ask the same thing. Its reassuring seeing the responses. I Am 50f and generally a go type person. The rash and pain left arm and left upper back has mostly gone and subsided but I Am still really tired and feeling off. Similar to how I felt in the weeks after my first bout with Covid. Definitely resting and hydrating and taking the colloidal oatmeal baths which helped so much at the worst part but I have a job and family and now Thanksgiving to host
14382,"If I had a daughter, I wouldn't advise her to take Gardasil/HPV vxx: First of all, I will make sure no daughter of mine is ever going to have sex, so she won't need a vxx anyway. But there are no good reasons for others also to have the HPV vxx. **1)** The HPV vxx trials were typical pharma capture. **The trial had a surrogate endpoint rather than a clinical endpoint**. To understand what is a surrogate & a clinical endpoint, let's take an example of a different medication which would be easier to understand. Let's say there is a new medication for hypertension (high blood pressure). Why does someone with hypertension take medication - no, it's not to lower his blood pressure. The point of treating high blood pressure is not to lower your blood pressure but to prevent complications of high blood pressure & also to live longer. Hence a trial should capture those endpoints - which are called clinical endpoints. Hypertension medication trials typically have endpoints as mortality, complications & quality of life rather than just checking how much systolic & diastolic pressures have reduced. Lowering blood pressure is a surrogate endpoint and a trial which captures your blood pressure may be good enough as an initial trial but it's not enough to prescribe someone that medicine. For all you know the medication may lower your blood pressure without increasing your life or reducing any complications. Or even worse, may increase your complications & chances of death. There are many drugs which do that - i.e. Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) which actually lower your arrhythmia but increase your mortality - i.e. they are actually bad for you even though they lower you arrhythmia. **HPV/Gardasil trial endpoint wasn't whether they prevent Cervical Cancer**. They used a surrogate endpoint - whether you get Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) or not. Only 1% of CIN cases progress to Cervical Cancer. So essentially a trial of very little value. **2)** You may frequently see a stat from public health which says that was a 29% decrease in cervical CA since the HPV vxx - this is on the field data & not trial data. But this is again a case of Pig Pharma cleverly presenting stats. The 29% was the relative reduction. **Absolute reduction was a miniscule 0.00024%"
14385,Shingles vaccine experience: my aunt had shingles. trust me you do not want it. she said it was like raw skin exposed and lemon and salt were on the wound. and a new sore would form every few days.
14387,Shingles vaccine: I had no aftereffects. My husband's arm hurt. I got my vaccine ON my 50th birthday because I would known several people in their 30s and 40s who would had shingles and a big no thank you about all of that.
14390,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Sore arm. That Is all for me. I was anticipating the worst.
14391,Hi Lori I hope it is not as painful as the shingles vaccine I had the other day
14392,Shingles with PHN after: Gabapentin can take about 6 weeks to get to full effectiveness. For me it did not do much for my headaches and really messed up my ability to think. I weaned off of it after two effective months. As a friend once said my brain is the best thing I have going for me so something shortcircuiting my synapses just was not for me. While the double vision could be from exhaustion aftereffect of both shingles and antivirals it is still something to note to your doctor if it gets worse. I am rooting for you
14396,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am a freak of nature and had them twice. I still remember seeing the poster in my pediatrician's office a few months after my second round for the vaccine and was like MOM
14397,RSV vaccine?: My baby girl just received it on Monday along with her second round of hepatitis vaccine. She had no reactions at all.
14400,Shingles vaccine under 50?: Both myself and my spouse got it last year and we are under 50. We had to pay for the medication out of pocket as insurance does not cover it until you are 50 or immune compromised.
14401,Shingles vaccine at 27?: 28 years old got the vaccine. It was fine. I have UC
14407,Long covid shingles I Am just so done with this: I did not get on antivirals as I did not catch it in time as I did not know what it was doctor said they do not work if you do not catch it within 72 hour window of the rash appearing . I think I am day 5 now and to be honest its just like a sun burn feeling which I think the most of it has peaked now I have itchiness now I think I have a mild case compare to many its a patch on my back but its not massive. My doctor said Permanent nerve pain from shingles is actually quite rare and if its tolerable for me now it should not get worse I have not had to take much pain medication at all just cold gel packs on my back for the itchiness
14410,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I know it does not apply to any of us but when you are old enough to be eligible for it get the vaccine. My dad had shingles years ago and it fucked him up for a good couple of months and he was still feeling symptoms weeks later. Seeing him in agony was grim.
14412,First shingles vaccine side effects: It kicked my ass for a few days but I figured that was because I got it the flu shot and the pneumonia shot all at the same time.
14416,I am failing motherhood and my partner is suffering the consequences: You sound so much like I did after I had our kid. I do not want you to go as long as I did without help. Postpartum depression is very real and strikes in painful unforeseen ways. I suddenly was having overwhelming fury that scared me and made me feel such deep failure and shame. No doctor told me postpartum depression can appear as bonedeep fury like that but they have posters EVERYWHERE saying do not shake the baby I had spent my life pretending to not have ADHD to the outside world that when I really needed help it felt like my whole world was going to rip apart. I finally hit rock bottom and realized I could not forgive myself if I actually hurt my baby so told my husband my deepest shames and how worthless I was as a mother. I had a wonderfully sweet easy child too. He hugged me. He told he loved me. He told me he would make me a doctor appointment. He told me I was so strong for trying to fight this alone for so long. He said he was so proud of me for telling him. I went to the doctor and was immediately handed a prescription to help with postpartum depression. The doctor said my symptoms were clearly PPD and I did the right thing by getting help. You are not a failure. Failure can only occur when you stop trying. This is a moment to ask for help. The mask of normality you have created for years to blend in with normal people is not worth risking your life or your childs life. I Am crying as I write this because the thought of you going through what I did is so upsetting. You are strong. You are loving. You are a good mother. I am proud of you for making this post. Do Not wait and just keep pushing through like I did. Tell your partner what is happening all of it. Tell your doctor how you are struggling and get help. After that you both can reconsider the whole shingle trip thing. As a united team with all the information. And you might be pleasantly surprised at how understanding family can be when you let them see behind the mask a little. The ones that still judge you are not worth your time. With ten years of motherhood behind me now the facade of normality takes time to tear down. I still struggle with feeling like a failure sometimes but I want my daughter to never judge herself as harshly as I have judged myself. Accepting and loving myself is modeling the selfconfidence I wish for my daughter. Showing her my weaknesses and how I healthily handle them is teaching her the same. Her father and I are ASD and ADHD so these coping skills are very important for her to learn. We do not bend over backwards for our extended family anymore. We are a family now and that supersedes all others. We do not juggle everyone elses wants and burn ourselves out to please them or make things easier on them or because someone expects us too. I might seem cold but would you really demand your adult child to leave their untreated PPD partner and new baby in a similar situation? Do Not worry about this right now but keep this in mind for the future when you start working through reparenting yourself so you can model healthy selfimage to your kid Distrust every sentence you say to yourself that contains the word should. Please feel welcome to message me for anything. I do not have all the answers but talking is not always about answers. Its about feeling seen and accepted too.
14418,"Developed a rash after Johnson & Johnson shot - Turns out it's measles!: Hey friends, Just wanted to share my recent health scare with you all. A few weeks after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, I noticed a rash developing on my face and neck. Initially, I thought it might be a common reaction to the vaccine, but the rash continued to spread and became more pronounced. I decided to visit my doctor, and after some tests, it was revealed that I had contracted measles. The doctor explained that the vaccine may have temporarily weakened my immune system, making me susceptible to the virus. I'm currently undergoing treatment and trying to manage the discomfort caused by the rash and fever. Has anyone else faced a similar situation after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Any tips on dealing with measles symptoms? Hoping for a speedy recovery and wishing everyone good health. ---"

14429,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: I got both doses of the shingrix vaccine. Not any different than a flu shot to me sore arm for a day. It was covered by my health insurance. From what I understand about shingles is it is more than worth it.
14430,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I am 54f and I was able to get the vaccine for RSV because I had a heart attack at 39. Side affects sucked but totally worth it
14435,35 female Here is the picture These appeared on my stomach while on vacation. The orange cluster has been there almost a week and the blue appeared yesterday after I got home from my trip. They have started off itchy but then change into a burning feeling. Could they be bed bugs or shingles? Really hoping not bed bugs but also want to do something about it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE if it is. Thanks for any help
14436,Second Shingles Shot: Its one bad day vs a recurring nightmare. Both mine sucked but the alternative sounds far worse.
14437,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: If you plan on having or being around kids definitely get the vaccine. My mom got it as an adult and it was brutal.

14441,Shingles flare?: I have had shingles twice in the last 10 years first bout was bad pain through my right mid section  rash from my belly button around to back...last time was much milder left side rash on back I did note noticeand exacerbation of MS symptoms...I was put in Valtrex right away both times
14443,Dr gave me Shingrix 2 days before I tested positive: She is not an OB she is just my regular general practitioner. I have an OB appointment next month. My period was due today and did not come so I took a test and got 2 lines. Took 5 more tests all positive. Yes she did recommend I get the vaccine and I trust her but not happy I got it while I was pregnant and laying in bed with a fever while unknowingly pregnant.
14445,Shingles vaccine experience: I actually know two guys who were stricken by Polio. One was affected more upper body and speechmouth. He is a bicycle riding fool though and couldcan ride forever. The other one has mostly paralyzed and atrophied legs. He is a powerlifter with many benchpress records. Polio never went that far away.
14449,Excruciating pain it feels never ending. Is this normal?: You definitely need something strong for pain. I had to use pain meds for like 67 days at least. It was horrific pain. Lightning bolt pain. My heart goes out to you. The valacyclovir does not help with the pain at all. You are correct. Get your doctors nurse on the phone and I Am sure they will help you. If you have any more questions we are here for you. Please take care. Shingles is a nightmare. Ice packs and sleep are your friends. God Bless.
14450,Shingles Sucks: I had a mild attach in my thirties stressful new job think toy store at xmas doc put me on anti virals and codeine based pain killers I have not had an attach since but I Am only 50.

14459,Shingles vaccine: I got the bad totally worth it
14462,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I got my 1st shingles shot with a Covid shot and it was the worst thing ever. Haven't gone back for my second. That was over a year ago and I blame it on the Covid shot. I had the worst pain in my joints and muscles. Could barely walk and stairs were the worst. Did a month or so on steroids and still have some pain. I know I need to do the other shingles shot but am so scared. My son had chicken pox at 3 months old and had shingles in 5th grade and middle school. Both were mild cases per se but he hurt bad. I'm still scared to get the 2nd.
14464,My husband got shingles not long after first being exposed to people with the shot. We never got any.
14466,I Saw proof with my own eyes that shingles shit spreads via shedding. I knew a vaccine freak who made sure to get her lovely dose of the shingles vaccine the husband did not damned if not a few days later maybe a week the husband got that chit from her

14470,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mother told me how excruciating shingles were and encouraged me to get the vaccine. Went the next day.
14472,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Another thing to mention. The control group and the vaccinated group both still got covid19 and the incidence of people reporting shingles was still higher even though it was subject to higher rates of Covid19 infection. My own family has been dealing with health issues that arose 6 months after receiving the vaccination as well with my mother being diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. There is research that indicates a causal relationship between MM and Covid19 infection and since all three of us still got sick at some point it is hard to say what led to it. I personally have yet to receive the vaccine and it was the subject of many arguments between me and the family but since my mother became ill those conversations have passed.
14473,Shingles for the 2nd time forehead: Thank you. Luckily I have a solid week of antiviral tx before we are set to leave. Best case is Ill just have a scabby face in all the pictures I plan to take ugh. My lymph nodes have gone down considerably since yesterday so I hope that is a good sign. My first outbreak when I was 12 was on my trunkleft side and it felt like being tasered when the pain set in. Did Not have antivirals back then or maybe I was too young. Luckily very minimal pain on my face so far just brief Zaps if cool air or a breeze hits my face. I Am putting faith in the Valtrex
14474,Acyclovir dosage: Sounds like a pretty standard dose but admittedly not a doc here. I was on much higher when I was hospitalized for shingles but that was a super severe flare I had. I have never heard of 5x a day either wild. I imagine that runs into adherence barriers with people forgetting to take it that often.
14477,I had shingles took vaccine and no fever and other stuff. You must have a lot health problems
14481,Diagnosed today.: The first month I could barely stand from the headache. It felt like I was being jabbed with ice picks. I had lightening strikes in my eyes. Horrible episodes. The head shingles is the worse pain of anyplace else since it effects the brain. I am going on three months with pain. it is 70 better but still suffering. I found a head massager that actually helps a bit. I do not know the name but I got it at Walgreens pharmacy.
14482,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: This happened to me too and living in the tropics in constant heat triggered my body
14484,Shingles vaccine experience: Had both shingles shots. Nothing other than minor discomfort.
14485,Shingles vaccine: I had the vaccine The sore arm was not a big deal. You should definitely get the vaccine you do not want shingles.
14487,man I feel like a truck ran over me lol by Tylenol is my best friend so far. fever and body paid is common. this is the second doses so I am good. if you got Varicella while a Kid you must get the vaccine. you do not want to mess with the Shingles.
14491,Shingles vaccine experience: Do it. My Dad had shingles in his eye. Horrible.
14493,I am told that the rapid development of cataracts in both eyes and acute herpes zoster is merely coincidence. 4 weeks after that vaccination.
14497,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I got mine a couple of years earlier than was recommended because my sister got it and it looked like a living hell.
14498,Shingles vaccine: Everyone reacts differently. My suggestion is that you get it because my sister used to get shingles and this strong vibrant woman was brought down to her knees by pain that no OTC could touch. It was horrible to watch her suffer.
14502,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I just got an updated shingles vaccine two weeks ago and my arm was fine. I got my first 1 on my 50th birthday there was no way I am dealing with shingles.
14506,"Anyone get second Covid vaccine while having shingles?: Update: I got my second dose and other than being tired for a couple of days, I didn't have any other side effects. I'm still recovering from shingles (rash is gone now and on gabapentin for pain), but it didn't get worse. I got shingles after my first Pfizer vaccine. I'm due for my second dose in two weeks. My doctor says I should go ahead and get second dose as I will be done with antivirals and my rash should mostly be dried up by then. I was wondering if anyone has gotten their second dose and did you do okay?"
14508,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Just woke up from a night of whimpering and adjusting. I am hoping this does not last 6 weeks but if it does food you get botox they insurance??
14510,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: so chicken pox is caused by a virus called varicellazoster and you get blisters all over. once chicken pox goes away the varicellazoster virus stays dormant in your nervous system for the rest of your life. at any point from then on that virus can be reactivated and infect whichever part of your nervous system it woke up from... for example and this is a very weird case lol a couple years ago when I was only 32 my wife cracked my back for me and it hurt SO MUCH I thought I was severely injured. she must have pinched a nerve or something but I was fine the next day...... Until the next week when I started developing a rash on only one side of my torso back and front that lined up exactly with the vertebra that my wife messed up. The doctor did not believe me when I thought it was shingles but she got a swab tested at my insistence and sure enough it was. So my wife gave me shingles by cracking my back wrong and releasing the virus apparently that is pretty rare though. mostly it comes when people are older andor their immune systems are not as strong hence why my doctor did not believe me I was not old enough and my case was pretty mild. so all that to say the first time you are sickened by varicellazoster is chicken pox. You do not catch shingles from other people since it is a nerve infection from a dormant virus... but if someone has shingles their rashblisters contain the virus which can be passed to others and give them chicken pox if they are vulnerable to it have not had it or have not had the vaccine. so when I had shingles I had to be very careful not to touch my newborn who had not yet been vaccinated.
14511,: why did i get shingles when i received both vaccines for shingles?
14512,Just yesterday I had to go to the hospital because I stepped on a rusty and wet nail. The story goes like this The landlord told us that he was going to repair the roof and put new roof shingles. This has been a problem for years now especially since it had a big hole in the roof. So he hired some roofers to get it all fixed up and everything. BUT before anyone started on the job we clearly told him that we would like for either him or the workers to get a magnetic sweeper to pick up any nails that were on the ground after the job. The job was done 2 days ago and not only that but he also did not tell us anything about it being done. Yesterday around 7pm I was going to work on my car so I walked to the basement door from outside the house and as I was walking to the door 2 steps away from the door I stepped on the nail and it went straight through my crocs and punctured a hole in my foot. I have pictures of the nail and my foot while it was bleeding. I sent it to him right after it happened. My question is am I able to sue him for what happened to me? Considering the fact that we told the landlord several and countless times to make sure everything was picked up and most importantly to pass a magnetic sweeper for the nails. Not only that I also went to the hospital like 10 minutes later. I had to get a tetanus shot and also got prescribed antibiotics. I am in the state of Washington living in Seattle if that makes any difference.
14514,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: You can get Shingles more than once. Just browse through this group and you will find people who have had it multiple times. I got the Vaccine after I had it. At the very least it is supposed to help prevent permanent nerve damage.
14515,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I hate to tell you I am on my 8th month. The first month was the worst and the sores have healed but the nerves are still recovering. I also put off getting the vaccine.
14520,Shingles vaccine: I got Shingles in 2020 as well. I was in my 40s. I still suffer from postherpetic neuralgia. I get pain at times sitting down mostly on the couch. I get periods of time on and off where it is consistent every day and other times not at all. The past month or so has been consistent unfortunately. Ill probably have this the rest of my life.
14521,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Well good job getting it done. I can handle a sore arm better than all the other things people are posting about long term damage from shingles flushed face
14525,A Week In My Life Vlog 407: I Have had shingles twice. Its no joke Getting my first vaccine tomorrow.
14529,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I got ganciclovir gel for eye shingles and it worked far better than alciclovir. But I think it had side effect of scar. Anyway it was treated well with laser. I hope you get better soon
14532,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I am coming up on two weeks and I still have throbbing pain in the back of my head but the first few days were far more debilitating. I actually wailed in pain like I was delivering a baby. On gabapentin and if I miss a dose I have more pain. My itching has only gotten worse. This thing is MEAN. I hope your mom gets to feeling better.
14534,Shingles at 35: I have shingles on my eye face and scalp and already knew what it was before any semblance of a rash. I started getting a raised welt like spot above my eyebrow and at the top of my head where the pain and itchy was worst and the doctor brushed it off saying it was occipital neuralgia. I got blisters a day later and saw a virtual doc and they gave me valtrex but nothing for pain luckily I have gabapentin at home. I messaged that virtual doc the next day begging for something more for the pain they said no then messaged my pcp they said I need to come in person and I physically could not I could not see to drive and they said oh well. Only online did I read that shingles around your eye is an emergency and you need to see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible Every thing seriously wrong with me rheumatoid arthritis critically low vitamin d levels a year ago now shingles I have had to diagnose myself with and beg to be taken seriously by doctors. Its ridiculous and frustrating. I do not work in the medical field lol These docs are rushed patient to patient and somewhere in there they stop actually listening or believing their own patients.
14535,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Yes I had shingles earlier this year age 59started on my forehead  headed for my right eyethe need for antivirals before it got into my eyes is what got me to the doctor. They did the trickit just felt like I had the flu for a few days
14541,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I got mine last week at 33 weeks. I trust my OB with mine and my baby's life so when she said you should absolutely get it I did. It was already an easy decision for me since I will be giving birth in peak sick season anyways. The maternal RSV shot is different from what babies receive. The maternal shot is a protein that helps our body make antibodies which then are passed onto our baby. While the shot babies get is already antibodies directly introduced into their body. Also I see it as it is one less shot that she will be having to get. I did not have any side effects not even so much as a sore arm but everything person's body can react differently.
14546,Exposing Covid Vaccine Trials  Shane Smith Has Questions w Brianne Dressen: This lady's story was pretty interested but obviously she improved 12 months after onset from her covid trial shot. She is able to articulatespeakbe concise in complete sentences. Her facial movementsmoutheye blinking is normal. There is no problems w her upper extremities Looks like she is looking for a big lawsuit payout
14549,I remember dad going to ER delirious with pain from what they suspected was shingles. I was straight to my doctor and got the vaccine I was not 50 so I paid up to get it there is a newer version now but I Am hoping the one I took is enough. Hope you recover quickly
14550,Shingrix is a hell of a vaccine: I had it on my right cheek in 2022 inside left ear in 2023 and above left eyebrow in 2024. I work for a pharmacy so I see some people's prescriptions for daily antivirals. I think that is usually for herpes but I asked my doctor about it and she prescribed it. I am pretty scared of getting shingles again. I have a mast cell disease so sometimes taking steroids is unavoidable and I had several days of steroid use before each episode of shingles so I feel like it is likely it could happen again.
14553,Shingles vaccine: I have had both doses and experienced zero side effects. I hope I do not have to know what shingles feels like.
14554,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Second shot SUCKED I Am glad there is not a third though I Have heard it may need a booster after 7 years.
14555,My neighbour is now blind. He took the shingles vaccine as advised by his gp who got his cut of the 200. Presumably it is the live attenuated version. The docs say it was chicken pox infection. You obviously have no idea what you are on about. Amateurs.
14556,Second Shingles Shot: I got shingles when I was about 15 during the summer. It was so much pain that I ended up being drugged out for about 3 weeks. After the pain went away the scabs formed and an insane itching started. I still have scars where I scratched my back and chest. I totally knew I should not scratch but for the love of God I just could not help myself.
14557,41 and got Shingles: Reactivation of herpes zoster as shingles after Covid vaccine is one of the well documented but hopefully rare complications of those vaccines only know one person that experienced this also early 40s. Some examples but lots more on pubmed.
14561,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I just had shingles a few months ago and it was one of the worst experiences of my life
14569,Hi all. I 26 F got diagnosed with poststrep reactive arthritis about a week ago. I had strep about a month ago and I finished my antibiotics the way I was supposed to. A week later I started having pain in one shoulder. Thought maybe I pulled it but the pain spread to my collarbone and chest and was really bad. I went to urgent care and they said I probably had shingles. Then the pain spread to the other side of my chest and my right shoulder. I went to the ortho who said maybe I had some chest inflammation going on. I started a medrol dose pack that helped a ton When I tapered off that the pain came back and this time I woke up barely able to move because it was in my hips and my knees too. I went to the urgent care again where the doctor said this looks like poststrep reactive arthritis. I started a second course of zpack finished now and prednisone. I just had a baby 3 months ago. Hes my fourth kid. I Am so tired of being unwell. I finally felt better after my pregnancy and csection and now I Am dealing with this. I just want to play with my kids work hard at my job enjoy time spent with my husband. I Am so tired of always being in pain. I do not know how long this is going to last and I Am scared. I Am trying all the other things I can think of  taking turmeric matcha gentle exercises when my prednisone kicks in. Really just looking for some support or advice. Its hard to explain how bad this pain is to others. I Am feeling so mentally low right now. I Am also paranoid that this is actually rheumatic fever and not reactive arthritis and I need to be getting my heart checked? I see the rheumatologist at the end of December.
14571,Hello everyone I am a 36 year old male who broke out in a shingles rash the day after I got back to the USA from a two week trip to Japan on 426. The first month was awful to say the least and my rash has healed since then but I still have nerve pain on my body that feels like the worse sunburn and body ache. I Am prescribed gabapentin Meloxicam and also taking OTC NSAIDs. The gabapentin makes me so tired so I try to take it only before sleeping. I Am so upset because I Have been unable to workout at the gym doing HIIT cardio or CrossFit. I am beginning to do light exercise such as bike riding and jogging. I was referred to pain management for post herpetic neuralgia and am scheduled to get an epidural steroid injection from a pain doctor at the end of July. The doctor said it should provide instant relief. Has anyone had this procedure? Will it provide instant relief and will it allow me to stop taking the medications I Am on? I Am trying to stay optimistic. I appreciate any information you can provide I hope you all get better soon Thank you.
14572,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles at 23 after moving countries getting hit by a car as a pedestrian and just finding a job after two months of searching. All over my neckshouldersback. Never had chickenpox but found out at that point that I would had the vaccine after my brother was part of the trials. Roommates who had never had chickenpox were not allowed near me while the area was weeping. So itchy. The doctor gave me anticonvulsants because my system was sending signal bursts along the nerves and they wanted to prevent permanent nerve damage. I almost passed out a few times from the electroshock my nervous system was administering to my neck. 010 do not recommend. Whether you had chickenpox as a kid or got the vaccine I highly recommend now following it up with the shingles vaccine.
14574,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: Second dose is an ass kicker. Actual shingles is horrific. Get the shots
14580,Shingles vaccine experience: Got my flu covid and shingles vaccine a few weeks ago on the same day. Slightly sore arm that was it. Shingles sounds terrible the jab was not.
14582,"Varicella booster question: 25F 130lb 5'1"". I was vaccinated for varicella as a child with both doses. I found out I lost immunity (via blood test) as an adult and got another booster shot. Since I already received 2 doses as a child, will one shot be enough to gain back immunity or will I still need a second one 28 days later? (So 4 total)"
14583,Shingles and other Vaccines: Shingles is worth it. My hubs gets a fever and is sick for 24 hours every time he gets it. But trust me shingles itself is wayyyyyyy worse
14585,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Same here... I had exaggerated symptoms that were downplayed by pharmacist. Some pain and swelling at site and you might be a little tired for 2 to 3 days. My arse For 4 days I felt like I would been drugged during the day and the arm did not stop the throbbing and sensitivity for 5 days and has a fever of 100 first 2 days. UGH
14587,"Shingles on back, family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: I sure did. When I was 5."
14590,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: This is interesting I got the round of vaccines as a teenager high school? and tested positive for HPV I think at 29. Tested positive for 2 years after and then it went away At first I was surprised I even got it with the vaccine but apparently it does not protect against all types. Either way I imagine the vaccine prevented the types that could lead to cervical cancer similar to you
14605,Shingles vaccine: I Have had shingles much worse than the vaccine get the shot
14608,Should I get the shingles vaccine? (age 30): My 33 year old brother and I run a small company together. He was recently diagnosed with shingles. I have had chicken pox and am susceptible to shingles. I also have two young children at home (a 4 month old boy and a 2 year old girl). My daughter has had the chicken pox vaccine while my son has not. I understand that the shingles vaccine is generally administered to those over 50 so I'm wondering if I should I get vaccinated? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
14609,I would rather feel crummy from the shot than actually get shingles. Two guys that I worked with got it around the same time and they were in so much pain. Not for a couple of days but for a month or so. Get the second one.
14611,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Yes it is worth it I had shingles on my forehead near my eye when I was in my 40s and as soon as I was eligible in age to get Shingrix I got it. Would like to avoid another bout of shingles if at all possible. I would urge you to get it if you are able and do not have any contraindications. I was lucky when I had it near my eye that it did not go into my eye  that can be very serious  and did not have any lasting issues with pain post herpetic neuralgia.
14612,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Had both pic and shingles now got the vaccine. Got my first shingles outbreak at 40. But luckily was on pain meds from the VA so just was more annoyed and looked like a leper. The pox however still remember that hell.
14616,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles at the age of 8 I remember it being an immense pain. I was off school for 3 weeks.
14624,RSV shot: My 34 weeker twins came home on oxygen in Dec 2022. They eventually came off oxygen have been healthy unfortunately contracted Covid HOURS before receiving that vaccine at 6m and came through it just fine. They were JUST ineligible for the RSV shot this fall and believe me I begged and would have bribed someone if I thought for a second it would have worked supply was super low where we are. They got RSV over Christmas 2023 and it was just awful. My son had an awful wet cough for months afterwards and got an ear infection that did not clear for months so he ended up getting ear tubes put in. And he got off easy compared to my daughter who had to be rushed to the ER to get put on oxygen. I took her into the pediatrician because she had a 104 fever for days and was limp and listless and they almost sent me home before checking her oxygen saturation. She was there for two days and got better but not well enough to go off oxygen. So we ended 2023 the same way we started with a kid on an oxygen tankwhich is an awful thing that I never thought Id have to relive. I get that it sucks seeing kids suffer from vaccine side effects but they did you a favor and I would have gladly taken your spot to save my kids what they went through with RSV.
14628,RSV vaccine?: Yesmy 5 week old just got it today. So far has had a lot of watery poo and some additional fussiness etc. Way better than rsv though so I Am happy we got it. We plan to fully vaccinate her with everything offered like we did our now 4 year old.
14629,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: If they will give it to you get it I got shingles and it sucked.
14634,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I have had both shingles shots and did not have anything more than arm pain. I have also discovered that doing yoga with arm pain is tons of fun but does shorten recovery time to one day.
14635,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: I had shingles when I was 30. Even though it was a mild case it caused a significant amount of pain and discomfort. My advice to anyone is to get the vaccine if you can. Unfortunately I am still too young to get it
14637,Hi everyone I have been diagnosed with SLE for around eight years. This happened to me a couple years back. I got a very painful rash that began on the lower back and stretched to my thigh down to my knee. It was the worst pain I have ever felt but had no clue what it was. No joke I was in complete agony. Turns out it was the worst case of shingles the urgent care doctor had ever seen. I got meds but still suffer from Postherpetic neuralgia and probably will for the rest of my life because of the nerve damage. We had no clue why the shingles rash had gotten so out of control until I spoke with my rheumatologist. He was pretty mad we had not called him did not think about it TO BE HONEST as I just wanted the pain to stop because it turns out that Cellcept made the shingles worse. Ooops. In any case I got the shingles vaccine early before it was approved for younger people in the States and I am good. The pain from the neuralgia is manageable most of the time. So kings and queens beware and if you need it try to get the shingles vaccine.
14639,How did your baby do with the RSV vaccine? Same. Better or worse?: My babe did fine with it his dr. Said he had not even seen any babies get a fever or anything
14644,Neighbor let 16 year old kid get vaccine she ended with shingles.
14645,"Hey guys, I was diagnosed shingles today, is in my torax right side, like 2 patch of 2x2 inches, but there is the thing. I'm traveling tomorrow for Summer vacation to Cancun Mex, there is any body with knowledge about sun/Beach reaction? I'm start today with valacyclovir and caladryl lotion. thanks"
14646,Shingles vaccine experience: Sore arm for a day no side effects. Same went for husband.
14647,Shingles vaccine experience: I got shingles at the age of 10 and let me tell you....it was miserable. I got it in my ear face and mouth. Dr told me if it would have hit a nerve above that I would have gone blind in that eye. As it was I had scaring all over my face my ear is not ok most of the time and when I eat anything the whole side of my face sweats. I am now almost 54 and over the years the scars have faded to where you do not notice unless I point them out and you look close. There are many days months years that I forget I had shingles....until tonight....was eating popcorn and my lovely husband laughed at me because he thought I had popcorn grease on my face....uh no...I am just sweating...thanks for laughing at my expense buddy to the moon And then I get in reddit and see this post ...guess the universe wanted to remind me Glad you got the shot ...sounds a whole lot better than having the virus instead.
14648,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents did unfortunately. I have very deep scars on my face from it I have had since I was 3 or 4
14651,The shingles vaccine sucks.: My shingles felt like someone burned my arms with cigars. Horrible pain. Id rather go through the vaccine than the pain of shingles again
14659,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Thank you for your reply this is very interesting as I have always had IBS and many problems with my stomach. I started taking daily probiotics but maybe a radical change of diet is what is necessary. I do not eat super healthy atm mainly because of the stress of it all and being so tired. Antivirals I have tried a few times but they never seem to work for me they give me shortness of breath and a pressure on my chest and seem to make the neurological symptoms worse. They do clear up the rash though. I do agree with what you say about curing the because of it and not just masking the symptoms. Happy that you found something that worked so well for you
14660,Shingles vaccine: The worst part is turns out you CAN get genital shingles.
14663,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got it at 29 and a few years ago both times were awful. I got the vaccine last year so I do not have to go through that again.
14664,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Wife got it during pregnancy just after it got approved. So our little one had coverage thank god. but he still ended up in the hospital with bronchiolitis was not RSV or COVID.. x200B Definitely get it RSV is so bad for the little ones.
14667,Shingles: Do you have a rash on your skin or is it just the nerves? A few weeks ago I could barely move and had a stabbing feeling in my back. I got to a regular doctor and she said it was probably shingles without a rash. She also said and I have read that people usually only get shingles once in their life. I guess that is not the case? Anyway in my case I am not even sure it was shingles. I have always had what I think is muscular pain on that side of my body. In a followup appointment with another doctor he found I also have scoliosis and degenerated discs in my spine. I am in the waiting room now actually for another follow up with him. Have not seen my rheumatologist yet. Sorry for the long story I was just surprised to see shingles being mentioned here
14668,Shingles shot Ack: Definitely Working the next day was not an option.
14671,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I Have had Shingles twice. Once when I was 21 and then when I was 45. It was excruciating pain both times. I Am turning 55 next month and keep saying I Am going to get the vaccine. Has anyone heard about getting it more than twice?
14675,Shingles Vaccine: I did not know what was happening the 3rd time around I felt like someone had punched me in the ribs front and back for 2 days. Saturday June 12th my inlaws' 65th anniversary party and Sunday the 13th. That Monday the tingling started I called my doctor's office to tell them I needed an antiviral. They quit asking me if I was sure it was shingles when I told them it was my third time around. I knew what it felt like. I just wish he would called in the strongest instead of the weakest.
14676,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Better than shingles my friend I had a former friend get shingles at 25 immunocompromised and he suffered ALOT on his left side including the face and spine and leg. The pain pills he got we were told were pretty strong opioids and they did nothing for him. We helped him by making some really potent Canna butter and my roomate and I kept him eating cookies n brownies and yeah he was high did not mind that but the pain subsided enough for him to shower n stuff. He definitely went through it though.
14678,RSV vaccine preterm labor risk?: I got it. Only side effects i had was a sore arm for a few days
14684,Shingles vaccine: Those shots are brutal but better than the virus
14685,I can t seem to find anything online so I m wondering if anyone knows if there s some type of blood work for active shingles. In the last four months I ve had a severe decrease in my kidney function a staph infection the shingles a bad reaction to the shingles medication an ear infection and seizures which have been one after the other. I m set to have open heart surgery and I m concerned that my shingles may still be active. My shingles are on the left side of my chest shoulder arm and neck but I don t have any blisters or lesions anymore for them to be tested. I have some areas of hyper pigmentation where the rash was and the texture of my skin hasn t gone back to normal. The only thing I have are a few pimples near my chin. They haven t scabbed and I m not prone to acne and they re what my doctor plans to look at when I see her next week. I m hoping for some sort of reassurance like some blood work that can show whether they re still active.
14689,: Thank you Dr. John Campbell. Seeing many family members effected cousin just died 62 stroke and lots of clots in brain sister 76 heart disease two blockage currently brother in law died 75 cardiomyopathy last year and niece with clots on Warfain at age 58 All vaccine This should not happen in family with historical longevity.
14692,I will start the Babesia treatment in January my tests have always been negative until now. I have been taking disulfiram for two years which is supposed to help against Babesia but somehow it does not really work for me...? I do not know what I will start with yet I will definitely ask my doctor for something light to start with is there such a thing? What helped you the most and what Herxheimer reactions did you have? I took cryptolesis for a week and that triggered an extreme immune reaction in me shingles the dormant Giardia were awakened again and I was allergic to everything it was bad. I do not want to have that again
14694,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: FOR A REALLY LONG FUCKING TIME. I had shingles for like 2 months start to finish and at least one full month was peak excruciating pain. The tshirt touching my skin felt like a branding iron for a month.
14695,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Had the shingles when I was in highschool. Was throwing up all night and had one of the worse headaches of my life. It felt like the center nerve of my brain was pulsating pain outward. Weird that it is the same thing that causes the chicken pox and is basically when your body has not developed enough immunity to fight it off a second time and yet i do not remember chicken pox making me that sick when I was a kid. neutralface
14697,Shingles vaccine experience: My brother in law hasn t had any feeling in his right hand since getting it two years ago.
14698,Recurring shingles advice: I Have had reoccurring shingles and my dermatologist was so unimpressed I guess it made me feel less worried about it. The rash itself is fairly mild but like you said the fatigue and I also get swelling and sharp side pains are the hard part. Usually I can feel it coming on and I take one of the horse pills he gave me and I avoid a full on outbreak. I Have been interested in reading about others experiences with food allergies here but I Have noticed mine usually come on during extreme hours at work or if I Am going out too much.
14699,Shingles vaccine: Whatever the reaction might be you do not want shingles. My aunt had shingles and it was terrible.
14706,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: My dad developed shingles on a trip and was hospitalized for a long time. His leg got paralyzed from the nerve damage and he is recovered a lot but he still has pain and limps. However he is had the shingles vaccine multiple times apparently never developed the antibodies from them. I have had chickenpox multiple times so I am wondering if there is something in our genetics that prevents us from properly developing the antibodies. I am terrified of getting shingles and I am with you I will get it as soon as I possibly can.
14712,Met someone the other day who ended up with shingles from the vaccine. I guess it happens but rare. He said his life was miserable and he lost a lot of work before his dr put him on gabapentin.
14713,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Shingrex is 2 shots 2 months? apart. My advice is get it on a Friday as Saturday is going to suck big time by Sunday I was fine. For me it was like every joint in my body got a good whack with a ball peen hammer and I Am told that is still 100x better than actually getting shingles.
14714,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I am 46 and also dealing with my first bout of shingles. So damn sucky I have got a mild case and it super sucks
14722,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did not go to a pox party and coincidentally got chicken pox as a teenager and it was awful. I still recall the fever dreams of medieval knights fighting on my wall insane fever could not keep my butt clenched tight enough for the runs and still have some scars from itching the bumps. Terrible experience My daughter was vaccinated and developed a mild case of chicken pox our primary care doctor was astounded but said the infection was lessened because she was vaccinated. At the time exposure at a young age was deemed the lesser of evils when exposed to chicken pox.
14723,Shingles vaccine experience: Get the vaccineIm suffering from shingles for multiple weeks now and its awful no loss of function or eyesight but constant pain itching and exhaustion.
14727,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I'm a few years away from being able to get it but I'll be forcing my husband to go when he turns 50 at the end of this year. I'll be prepared to look after him in case it hits him hard. I'm sorry it's bad for you - hang in there! You'll make it through this and will be ready for #2.
14728,Shingrix vaccine symptoms for 7 days after first dose: Went to ER today. Doc did blood tests to rule out cold C covid Flu etc. Everything came back negative to he prescribed prednisone and a muscle re laxer.
14731,Shingles vaccine: I have no history of chicken pox my Dr. and pharmacist both encouraged me to get the shingles vaccine and assured me I would be just fine. I was indeed just fine no side effects apart from a sore injection site.
14738,"Wary about getting the second covid vaccine dose (will it trigger shingles?): Recently got hired, yay! but they are asking for my second covid vaccine. never got it developed shingles in june 2023 following surgery. recent stress has been giving me symptoms of another possible outbreak. that being said, my body has been through a lot. new job is requiring covid vaccine, but will the second vaccine trigger shingles into a full eruption?"
14741,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: The RSV vaccine is not exactly a new vaccine. What Is new is that its more widely available. My daughter is turning 11 soon and she received the vaccine before being discharged from the NICU. Bradys are what kept her in the NICU but the vaccine did not do anything to hinder her progress. She did not have any negative side effects from the vaccine at all. What she had was Synagis. I do not know if that is the same thing you are being offered.
14746,41 and got Shingles: Yep I had them at 26 during an incredibly stressful time in my life. It was miserable. And I had lingering pain even after the lesions were gone. 010 would not recommend.
14748,Guy in grocery store does not want a free flu shot: From what I hear having Shingles is FAR worse though so I definitely do not regret getting it out of the way It is. Had shingles at 38. Got Shingrix as soon as it was offered through my insurance.
14751,Shingles vaccine experience: I had absolutely zero reaction to either shot. They did warn me Id feel awful but it did not happen.
14755,fourth time.. need advice: Sheer ly having it three times will. However can still get shingles after vaccination. I qualified to get the vaccine early because of continuous shingles occurrences then got shingles again about 18 months post vaccine. Still would recommend trying the vaccine though.
14757,Shingles vaccine: What lingers is a hot arm.
14759,Supposed to switch to Kesimpta soon.... Nervous AF.: You Will probably feel a little run down maybe a little flu like the first couple days after taking the first loading dose. Drink water take Tylenol cuddle up on the couch watching tv. You Will be okay
14760,Shingles vaccine: Got it a couple of years ago. It kicked my butt. But still had a shorter recovery than a case of shingles.
14765,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Not cool there is a book The Vaccine FriendlyPlan its written by Dr Paul Thomas and PhD Jennifer Margulis about what vaccines are necessary and what vaccines are literally BS. Ill be very careful in vaccinating my baby currently pregnant loads of research connecting certain vaccines to autism ADHD and other disorders and more recently Covid vaccines damages I myself and my partner have combined 5 friends under 38 who died or was left with heart conditions all healthy individuals. I do not believe it was on purpose but I believe it was a moneygrab and should not have been enforced given the lack of longterm testing. Your body your choice there is a balance being vaccine is ignorant being vaccine is the same use your brain to research with an open unbiased view in the same way academics and scientists do.
14766,Shingles vaccine: I got it in the past 14 months. Sore shoulder only issue. Good rx had a decent reduction with their app. Costco price is good with member rate.
14770,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Got it last year at 45. Absolutely miserable experience. Zero stars do not recommend. I was lucky in that it was only on my torso and I got to a doctor soon enough for the retro viral s to work effectively. Took me 46 weeks to heal and I still get weird nerve tingles from time to time. If you can get the vaccine friends. You do not want this shit.
14772,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Got shingles on my face 15 years ago and now I Am partially blind in my right eye thanks to its location. My head swelled like a basketball and I was in the hospital for 4 days. Terrible disease.
14773,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: That was me too after the second shot.
14774,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yeah it can be a doozy but better that shingles. I got shingles in my high 40s and one spot felt like the worst wasp sting on my back and another felt like I had broken glass embedded around my navel.
14783,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: until they can definitively prove that his shingles is caused by the vaccine i will keep shooting up the boosters until it kills me or maims me because they told me to vaccine up.
14786,I was finally able to book an appointment for my 4 month old just wondering how your baby reacted afterwards? Were they tired and fussy like other routine vaccines? Or totally fine? Just wondering as his last round of vaccines he had a melt down just want to be prepared lol
14793,Shingles vaccine: I am 68F had a mild case of chicken pox when I was 4. I got Covid but was only sick for 3 days it felt like a bad flu. Unfortunately I was positive for 2 weeks missed a friend's funeral and choppedsawed down a dead apple tree in my backyard. I try to stay active and rarely get sick.The one time I got a flu shot I got sick afterwards so I have not had one in 20 years. I do not like shots. Que sara sara.
14794,Shingles vaccine: Last year I got the first vaccine I got sick AF but alot of vaccine make me sick. It made me so sick I chickened out on the second. Then my friend got shingles ON HER EYEBALL. I restarted and got the first vaccine last week.
14795,Shingrix: Couple of days once the fever wore off it started going down.
14796,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine and got shingles. Yippie.
14798,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I am 43 and had shingles last May June. Still have nerve pain and have to sleep a certain way or the irritation is ridiculous. I have been telling everyone the same thing get it if you can My husband has actually never had chicken pox or the chicken pox vaccine so our oldest daughter fully vaccinated thank you looked after me. What a hellish experience I wish you all the best
14799,Shingles vaccine: I was fine after the first one I even had the covid shot at the same time. But like you I hear the 2nd time is the worst so I have that to look forward to.
14802,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My son recieved Beyfortus when he was around 6 months old. We were very lucky to receive the treatment because according to our pediatrician their supply was not enough to meet the demand fully so it was first come first serve and we were lucky to be there the day they would just gotten a shipment in. I do not know if the supply issue is everywhere though. We had zero issues with the treatment. It was a quick poke. My son also received his flu and Covid shots around that time and we were very fortunate that when I did get Covid two months after that he did not.
14804,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: When your role is the Jokester so no one takes your stroke seriously
14806,Shingles vaccine experience: Even mild cases of shingles is so much worse than the vaccine My coworker put off getting the shot and got a mild case that caused intense nerve pain.
14809,I have had flu vaccines for the past 10 years I have had all covid boosters shingles Hep C and every other vaccine you can think of... I never had a reaction and I never felt sore anytime. MAGA lunatics be crazy and quite a bit weird
14810,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: Thank you so much for sharing How scary with your LO though. I Am so sorry you had to go through all of that. To add rotavirus vaccine was a rough one when my first got it as well. We did hand hygiene the best we could but by his 6 month dose somehow I Am almost positive both my husband and I got the virus. Our doctor explained that since its a live vaccine and passes in his stool it was possible. We were SO sick but thankfully he was just fine
14812,Llysine reaction: I would think so People have such unique reactions to lysine. My first major reaction was a headache right in the center of my forehead and fatigue that knocked me out for a week or two. Feel free to back off if needed and work your way up slowly. I like to feel some level of symptoms just so that I know its doing something.
14814,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: Get it. I did. My baby was born 4 weeks early with little preemie lungs. She just got RSV 7 weeks old and my pediatrician expected us to have oxygen level issues and prob need a hospital visit. She had a mild stuffy nose for a week and that was it. I only know it was RSV because she was tested since she was congested at her PCP prior to having vaccines and since she was positive we delayed them two weeks. But I know if I had not had the vaccine she would have been really sick. Its so worth it.
14815,RSV  chicken pox vaccines  worth going private for?: Yes I paid for the chicken pox vaccine for my son when he turned 1. Absolutely worth the money no question. I will be taking every vaccine offered to me in pregnancy so flu  covid imminently whooping cough at 20w and RSV at 28w. The RSV vaccine in pregnancy has only recently been introduced and I Am elated about it.
14816,Shingles vaccine: I had no reaction to either vaccine. Rolled my sleeve down and forgot about it. However those that do have reactions you have my sympathy. Its hard to make yourself go down for the shot when you know it is going to make you sick for awhile.
14820,Shingles at 22: I am 22 and currently have shingles. After research I figured that is what it was and went to doctor for confirmation. I started antiviral at day 3 or 4 of symptoms. My arm and shoulder are blistered and beginning to scab over mostly. It seems to still be moving though because I can feel that sunburn sensation on my stomach and face now but no blisters or swelling there yet. The sunburn feeling is what I felt before I got the blisters on my arm. My concern now is that it might get to my eye.
14821,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I had chickenpox in 6th or 7th grade. Then again in high school. Then again during the summer off at home in my college years. Each subsequent time was much less pox. During one of my Doctor visits later on I mentioned getting it three times and the doc said the latter two were probably shingles. But i do not recall the latter two times hurting any more than the first chicken pox experience. Is not shingles supposed to hurt like a mofo? Got my shingles vaccines 2yrs ago after a an elderly family friend got hospitalized for it. It also spread to her eyes. And this week an aquaintance sent a group text telling everyone to get their shingles shot. She is had it the past two weeks and it got to her eyes too. She also said she would go through another knee replacement surgery over having shingles in regards to the pain.
14824,Shingles vaccine: My wife got shingles. It lasted a month. Painful inchy and spread all over her. Head to toe. And here the kicker it can come back again and again. She goes in for her first vaccination shot next week. I got vaccinated last year.
14830,34 Week Twins Contracted RSV While in the NICU: Not quite the same but our full term babe who spent 31 days in the NICU was readmitted to the children's hospital because he contracted RSV when he was 3 months old. He got the vaccine Wednesday and was admitted a few days later Saturday. If I am remembering correctly the peak day of the virus is day 5 so hang in there Even with all his respiratory trauma he did not need respiratory support just suction and monitored feedings. Those NICU babes are strong as hell. I hope yours get well soon
14831,Shingles vaccine experience: My wife got shingles in 2020 and is still dealing with the effects. Get the two shots. Trust me you do not want shingles
14837,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents did the same thing to me I also got shingles at 19.. single worst pain of my life I Have had a seconddegree burn across my entire left palm of my hand that still hurt less than when I got shingles I Am 32 now you never forget pain like that. Edit I should also add that when they did this to my sister I my sister got it so bad that she had chicken pox on her eyeballs she had then inside her ear canal she was completely covered.. I was like 4 or 5 years old at the time I still understood how serious my sisters condition was.. I am so glad kids these days will never have to experience that I Am petrified about possibly getting shingles again because it is a very real possibility. It just lives dormant inside you forever.
14841,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My Grandma got shingles a couple times and that finally put her into a nursing home. Coupled with her other health problems. Her face got all scarred up.
14842,I have shingles and it sucks. I did not realize how bad they hurt. If you have not already get your vaccine.
14844,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: I couldn t tell because you mention shingles at the end.
14846,Is exercise stress?: I think you'd have to ask your doctor. I had shingles twice in the last two years. The first time was on my face and the second time was inside my ear and on the back of my ear and neck. I'm trying to get vaccinated for it even though I'm not 50 yet. I have some ongoing pain from the ear shingles and I never want to deal with shingles again.
14849,First shingles vaccine side effects: I had maybe like 23 days of being knocked on my butt both times. If shingles were not so horrible and happening to people younger and younger I would run but it is and it is so here we are.
14851,Shingles vaccine experience: I had stress induced shingles when I was in my late 20s. That shit sucked I do not care how bad the shot hurts it is nothing compared to that nerve pain
14852,My Mother was diagnosed with stage IIB Cervical Cancer pT2b N0 Mx in July 2024. She went through radical hysterectomy and 22 sessions of Proton Therapy followed by 2 Brachytherapy. She has a transplanted Kidney because of which Chemo was not administered to save the Kidney. Now the cancer has metastasized to both lungs and liver Stage 4B. Looking for guidance on what course of treatment should we look for? Kidney is not our primary concern now. Edit Oncologistssuggested a combination of CarboTaxolAvastin. This will have 30 of transplant kidney failure. Keytruda Immunotherapy was talked about but they think this lead to kidney rejection. She is on immunosuppressants to avoid kidney failure and Keytruda will go in different direction.
14856,I think everyone has a reaction to the shingles vaccine. I know I did. It is I am told .00005 the discomfort of shingles. Life is all about choices .
14861,Put me out of my misery.: Shingles is one of the most painful experiences of my life. Take the shots ya pansy.
14863,Benefits and Side Effects of the Shingles Vaccine: I have never had shingles. Never getting the vac. Went 30 years without flu got JJ vac and within a year had cancer of immune system. Lymphoma. No more of these shots for me.
14864,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same no vaccine available. One of my siblings got it so we all ended up with it. No party per se but pretty hard to avoid us all getting it. I Have had shingles twice as an adult once very mildly when I was 29. Once a couple of years ago and it was excruciating. It also happened to be on my crotch. I had a shingles blister on my damn clit. It was awful. They gave me OxyContin. I did not have to ask they just gave it to me. I got the shingles vaccine about two years prior to the second round but still ended up with it.
14870,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Had it down my side and in my hair still have scars a decade later. Horrible pain for weeks . Get vaccinated.
14871,Got mine today. Now vaccine with covid flu pneumonia and now shingles and feelin fine
14872,I got my flu and Shingles shot yesterday. They did not have the Covid shot available so I am still on the hunt for that. Except for some arm soreness no side affects.
14873,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Rheumatic??? Wow I wondered why my doctor said I am developing rheumatoid arthritis. I already had osteoarthritis from being clumsy and bad taste in men. I wish there was more research out there about us lucky devils that the Pfizer vaccine did not like. I am looking at doing substitute teaching remote teaching or I have no idea what. I Have been on zinc 50 lysine 2000 vitamin d 3 and a multi for a year and a half now. It helps but the HPN is tremendous and now I have facial tics twitches and tremors on both sides of my face. Is there a term for us? I know my vaccination record matched the outbreaks and then it was deaths and stress that triggered outbreaks. I wish there was a term for this. When I try to explain it people are left in disbelief. I am sending positive vibes its been quite a journey.
14880,RSVImpfung sterreich: Unser Kind wurde am Montag geimpft. Hatte ein 1 Tag wahrsch. bisschen Glieder Schmerzen und war recht quengelig aber sonst keine Nebenwirkungen. Sie hat aber auch noch einen anderen Impfstoff gleichzeitig bekommen. Ich wurde zustzlich whrend der Schwangerschaft gegen RSV geimpft und hatte gar keine Nebenwirkungen.
14881,Does this sound normal? I myself have now been diagnosed with arthritis and I have spoken to two different rheum s about my mom and they both thought it was unusual. To be clear she is not an anti vaccine x er and has had vaccines many times in the past but her inflammation is out of control and vaccines because more inflammation so she is afraid she will be completely bed ridden from them. Recommended vaccine are shingles hepatitis covid. That is a lot to be expecting her body to handle even spaced out. Mom is 76 no health insurance for first 15 years of the disease and has never had proper treatment so she is in a very bad way. Am waiting in an appointment with her right now and trying to figure out what to say. Have kept my dx from mom for various reasons.
14886,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had a really bad case of chicken pox on my 4th birthday while on a Disney cruise. As a result my mom decided to do a chicken pox party with my sister so they could control when she got it. Cue the worst case my sisters pediatrician had ever seen. Hospitalization and my sisters whole body was covered in scars for 15 years. She still has a couple but thankfully much better. My mom felt so bad and made sure to spread her tale of woe to all so they would not do any more pox parties.
14887,: Is this clotting caused from the vaccines or covid virus ? I have had 3 vaccines. How do we remove this from our body?
14888,Shingles vaccine: My shingles went up my ear canal. Weeks of debilitating pain.
14889,Shingles vaccine: This. I was totally prepared for the worst and I only had a slightly sore arm after both.
14894,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom sent my younger sister and I to several that were happening in the neighborhood because our older sister had cancer and she wanted us to get it over with. We never ended up contracting it but years later I got the vaccine and all my others because I was working in healthcare. I know there was no vaccine at the time but my family treated covid like chicken pox and threw a party so they all got it over with as well. It had disastrous results and I hate it here.
14895,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got it as a kid and was sick for 3 weeks
14897,Are you 50? Get your shingles vaccine. Studies have shown that people who get a shingles outbreak have a 20 greater chance of developing dementia. Links below.: While you are there get your pneumonia shot too. I had no adverse side effects from the shot.
14898,Vaccine Schedule: I do not have advice about vaccines but can relate to your red hair anecdote My wife was born with red hair it is darker now but she is always had issues with vaccines every covid shot has given her a fever. Medications are also hit or miss there is been studies on anesthetics wearing off faster for gingers fyi. Good luck
14900,Shingles and other Vaccines: Can confirm I have shingles now and its awful I Am completely miserable
14901,41 and got Shingles: I had it right around 40 and it was literally the worst experience of my life. All over one side of my head and neck I have never been in so much pain. Hang in there.

14904,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Sore arm for a couple of days but much better than having shingles.
14905,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I had them at the very same spot 3 years ago Hurt like a bitch. Hope you are okay
14908,I have had pneumonia shingles before 50yrs old and now breast cancer before 50yrs old. All in the last 3yrs. Fuck the covid vaccine. I was healthy prior to my mandatory jab
14909,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Turned 50 and got the shots.
14916,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: More strains are covered by 9 than 4  after two instances of HPV in my 40s they cleared on their own  though one took over a year I ASKED my OB if I can have it even though its not typically part of protocol for my age group. I was 46 then and they had just increased age to offer to 45. My Dr agreed and I got the series. I did not have any adverse effects. Sore arm maybe. For me it was worth it for peace of mind that I Am protected against so many strains now there are many carriers out there who were never vaccine for it
14917,I tested positive for covid for the third time in October 2024. Two nights ago I broke out in a painful case of shingles. I have a large number of shingles lesions from my back around my waistline. I should say that I do not even remember getting chickenpox and neither does my mother and yet here I was on December 31 feeling sick as heck with so much pain in my back and my side. I could not sleep or sit comfortably due to the pain. Luckily I noticed them early and so the doctor was able to prescribe an antiviral. Hopefully they will be gone quickly. I know shingles are essentially triggered by a compromised immune system. The doctor asked me if I was recently ill and I mentioned I recently had covid. She said there could be a link. I found articles today showing that you are at a higher risk of getting shingles if you have had covid. Just another reason to avoid covid if it all possible.
14924,Shingles again?: I got the Shingrix series after my 3rd bout 3 years ago and I have had shingles 3 times in the last 5 months August October and November. Thankfully mild but Valtrex helped I am sure.
14926,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: My uncle got it at 30 and ended up in the hospital his fiance came to visit to help out found him almost non responsive and called an ambulance. I am so keen to get that vaccine when I am eligible.
14931,Shingles vaccine second dose: Yeah my second shot was pretty rough but that also means that my immune system is really working.
14934,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Thanks for the additional info. I thought it was related  especially since it hit me so hard after the rash showed up  and hearing the dr say it was not has me really discouraged. Not like anything can be done about it either way but he looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting it and then chalked it up to the medicine.
14936,New Shingrix data demonstrate 100 vaccine efficacy in the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over in China: Does the gE from Shin gri x have any overlap with HSV protein? I speculated one could take this with some added in HSV specific proteins. also doubting this 100 efficacy because I have a male relative who got Shingles after both Shin gri x and they also had zo st a vaccine before that
14939,RSV vaccine for infants.: Got it for my baby at his 4 month appointment. I am so glad we did Everyone around us got RSV this year and somehow we have so far avoided it.

14944,41 and got Shingles: I had a mild case at 39 or so. My immune system was toast due to stress and living in a house that exacerbated my allergies. I hope you feel better soon.
14945,Shingles with PHN after: I had Trigeminal Neuralgia about 15 years ago out of the blue on the left side of my face. My husband took me to the hospital but I kind of wondered if they knew what they were doing. Either way as you and I both know the pain is off the ricktor scale I am so sorry what your ex did to you.. Good luck and positive thoughts
14946,Did anyone develop a fever after getting the HPV vaccine? I recently got the Gardasil shot and ended up with a low-grade fever the next day. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to the HPV vaccine?
14950,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: I noticed my warts in November 2023. I got the Gardasil 9 vaccine right away and got my 3rd shot in May 2024. My original warts are gone but new onces have come in their place. Must be different for everyone.
14953,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had shingles at 37. My plan from that moment on was to get the first shot for the vaccine the day after I turned 50. I did not quite make that timeliness I set for myself but it is done now. Shingles is awful.
14957,shingles??: I had it in my 20s and tried to work through it Its rough to me it felt as bad as a bad flu took about the same time to recover first week was the worst second week I was a bit better. Just pain medication rest was all that helped me. Hope you feel better soon.
14961,You really do not want shingles. My neighbor was in agony with it for months. Got the vaccine as soon as eligible and yeah it knocked me on my ass for a day or two. But better than shingles.

14964,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: My daughter got her RSV vaccine at her 4 month appointment but we had to ask if it was available The Dr made it sound like they do not have it often and do not get many. It is definitely in demand.
14967,Shingles vaccine: Not me but the hubs just got it in conjunction with a covid booster and a flu shot and he felt fine. He is not normal though...
14968,FML... I got shingles: Which country are you? In the USA it is common for 1215 months. And vaccination within 5 days of exposure is recommended. Shingles is a result of stress though not viral exposure. It might be a coincidence but mine started from the spot of a pinched nerve in my neck. It was not getting better and started to spread so I went to the doctor who diagnosed.
14969,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have had shingles twice in my twenties and still have nerve damage from it not to mention scars and pox scars. I will HAPPILY make sure my baby does not get chickenpox so they will never get shingles. The fuck is wrong with people like this??
14970,Shingles vaccine: Just a plug for the vaccine Covid shot. I got sick from Moderna and Pfizer but the vaccine was smooth sailing. Its formulated like the flu shot is.
14977,Shingles vaccine: You do not want shingles. Trust me on that one. I had shingles in 2019. It was awfully painful and itchy and it put me out of commission for months. Get the vaccine. I got it two years later with no side effects.
14979,First dose awful side effects: Had similar side effects. Everyday was a little better. 15 days in and 0 side effecta
14980,I was diagnosed with shingles in early April and was put on pain meds. I have not been able to come off of them because I still have nerve pain and sometimes even get really bad shooting pain in the opposite shoulder the shingles was on. Does anyone have any experience with this? Will it last forever? What can I do to help it? I do not want to be on pain meds my whole life. They suck.
14982,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I had no side effects on the first one but I am getting the second one on Monday. Hoping for the best.
14983,Recurring shingles advice: I Have just got over my 6th bout of shingles. Dr said prednisone causes mine to raise its ugly head. Next time I Am going to take Valtrex with the prednisone to see if that helps. I got the shingles shots after 3rd round. I had to be clear of them so long before I got the shots. Finally got them a year ago. So 3x before and 3x after. I Have been lucky I usually get a quarter sized patch.
14986,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Totes. Shingles sucks. I had it as a teen and it was a little sore. I hear it is MUCH worse as you get older.
14991,I Am the idiot who went sure give me shingles vaccine dose 1 AND the flu shot and then spent the night thinking I was going to die. do not be like me.
14994,Had the second shingles shot: Mine was a couple of days of feeling abit off but I had shingles and I would take anything over getting that shit again. Never had so much pain. Just go get it seriously you do not want that shit on your face killing your nerves permanently.
14995,Multiple vaccines on Ocrevus together or separate?: I talked to my doctor about this yesterday. He said it was ok to get them together but this seasons flu vaccine is likely not available just yet. Taking the shingles vaccine with other total floored my mom when she did it. I would recommend waiting a week between. For timing though. He wanted me to get my Covid vaccine next week one month out from my next infusion while bcells are low. We just checked and I am 1 still. He said to wait for the seasonal flu vaccine and I could do it after my next infusion if I had to.
14997,Shingles vaccine second dose: Mine was unpleasant but shingles sucks so bad it is still well worth it.
15001,Shingles vaccine: I was told by my Dr that when I do get the shingles vaccine that I could expect to be sick for a few days. This is good to know
15003,I Am so mad at myself right now and need advice. Some backstory due to trauma with my upbringing I Am a huge people pleaser. I Am in therapy and it helps but there are other issues more important to work through right now than my people pleasing and I only get an hour a session lol. When I was pregnant with my daughter now 8 weeks old I was adamant that I would defend her against strangers approaching her no matter how uncomfortable it made me feel. Her health and safety is the most important thing to me. Now that she is here I love her more than anything but I Am still a terrible people pleaser. Yesterday in my buildings elevator my husband LO and I got on with an elderly lady. LO had just had her two month shots and was feeling crappy and we just wanted to get home and this lady asks about her and kind of leans in to see her then starts wiggling LOs foot. Mind you we do not really know this lady and its still cold flu and RSV season plus measles is going around to boot. I was incredibly uncomfortable and wanted to say something but just did not. I did not protect my daughter from this absolute stranger touching her and I Am so pissed at myself. I Am also pissed that this lady has NO boundaries but I should have said something. How do people handle this sort of thing in public? I do not really want to be rude but at the same time my babys needs to come first. Any advice would be super appreciated for this FTM
15005,GP autonomic dysfunction after shingles?: Thank you and thank you for your own personal account. It is very interesting to see someone else who developed complications after it I had to go to the ER to fill my meds yesterday I had to move so I am currently trying to rebuild my medical team starting with getting a family doctor and I was discussing the complications I had he was asking if I took antivirals either time since at least it seems GI complications seem to be more common he had not heard of it leading to autonomic dysfunction before but there is lots of evidence it does and especially for a virus that specifically attacks nerves I have both external and internal shingles so the internal attacks my organs while the external makes me want to claw my own skin off. Oh I agree I would not wish this on my worst enemy and everyone I have met will comment on how painful they have heard it is which I would love to discuss once I am no longer in pain but for now it is just like Can someone just knock me out until this is over with??? I am actually 3 weeks in now so the peak extreme pain is gone but it still feels like one of the worst sunburns I have ever had. I am so sorry you had such an awful case also It is very weird how it seems to affect people in the legs my GI specialists receptionist just recovered from shingles and her's were on her lower torso and she similarly could not walk for an extended period. I just find it such a weird virus since I am so careful not to get sick so it is nothing new in my system and yet it can be so destructive to form this rash that turns into large blisters that you just wait to open and scab over for some relief and then who knows how bad the scarring will be and how much feeling will return to some of the spots where I can no longer register pressure...painful itching is all that remains at this point. Thank you for your kind words I really appreciate it I hope you are feeling well and having a good day Take care of yourself
15009,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I got the shots in 2020 as soon as I turned 50. My dad has permanent nerve damage from when he had shingles years ago and I wanted no part of that. Anyway SURPRISE I got shingles last month it was pretty mild and I caught it quickly so I was able to get meds for it. 5 giant pills a day for seven days. I have no doubt that if I hadn t had those shots it would have been much worse. If you can get the shot do it The first one was way worse for me than the second.
15010,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: That Is something a lot of people do not understand I had chicken pox before I could really remember it. I Have got a scar on my nose from an infected pox. I Have been fully vaccinated as I grew older and currently my doctor wants me to have the shingles vaccine which I Am trying to get done but its jumping through hoops with my insurance company But long story short I Am at a higher risk for shingles because I had a mild case of chickenpox as a child
15011,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Omg this. I get recurring shingles. So much so that getting the shot is complicated for me. The virus is active in my body often either coming or going so the doctor has to blood test me then if I Am not active give me the shot. I get it every year more than once. Many times I get it internally. If you have a strong immune system you can fight it but its hell. The last time it was IN MY MOUTH. My gums were so inflamed and sore. I am going to try again in about a month. I Am over 55 if that helps anyone decide. If you have never had it get the shot. Oh no dementia in my family but this is one more reason to get it.
15016,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: My kid got it when he was four he was fully vaccinated. It was awful. Our pediatrician said it would have been worse if he was not vaccinated thankfully he was never hospitalized or anything. It was just miserable and his dad was sick at the same time so we just stayed home for most of that month. We always get the recommended vaccines on the recommended schedule. If I was not convinced before that helped confirm it.
15019,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got shingles at 33. Worst fucking pain I Have ever felt. And I Have given birth. Several spots on my left ribcage are still completely numb 7 years later while there is one spot towards my back that gives me a super painful nerve zap if pressed. Since I had it young I Am allowed to have Shingrix. If there is ANY way you can get it under 50 immunosuppression late chicken pox etc. I seriously beg you to take it. Its the worst vaccine I Have ever had I did nothing but sleep and take zofran for 2 days after but my god anything is better than shingles
15020,Second Shingles Shot: You feel lousy after a shot because its doing its job Your immune system is learning how to fight it off so of course you feel crappy for a couple of days. Either way please go out and get vaccinated
15022,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yes it would be impossible. But there are people out there who think they have never had chicken pox who actually have had it. They either were so young they do not remember it or they had a very mild case and do not remember it or both. My mom was one of those people who swore she would never had chicken pox. But then she got shingles mild case in her 70s so she must have had cp at some point.
15025,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I got it done two weeks ago at 326 with no side effects Covid vaccine always takes me out with headache and low fever so I was pleasantly surprised Also no signs of preterm labor not even some Braxton hicks contractions. Baby is worrying me that he is too comfortable in there and my doctor seems happy to let me go to 42 weeks still. I of course want baby to cook as long as he needs but man I am also excited to meet him and stop finger pricks and stop peeing 5x a night.
15027,Beyfortus RSV Vaccine Side Effects?: My daughter got it after she left the NICU at 4months actual. She had 0 side effects.
15028,Advice from the Council of Dads re Holidays and Sickness: Lurking mom here your wife is not crazy but it does sound like she has contamination OCD. I say that because I have contamination OCD. I know what its like to want to stay isolated in an attempt to protect your family but there comes a point when you have to weigh the importance of staying healthy with the other harm being done to your children. Barring any immune deficiencies you and your two oldest children should be able to visit with family for the holidays. And go out to eat and go to church. I totally get taking precautions like vaccines handwashing being outdoors when you can etc. but your children need to be around family and friends to become happy healthy welladjusted people. I know your wife knows that deep down but it sounds like OCD is winning right now and trust me doubling down on her brains desire to isolate is only going to make it worse. It feels good and right in the immediate but its doing more and more damage. I do think its perfectly reasonable however to want to keep the 2 month old home. She and the 2 month old can stay home during the family visit but the rest of you should go. If you 3 want to keep a little more distance from the baby for a couple days after that is fine but asking you all to stay away in an Airbnb is over the top once again barring any immune deficiencies. Your wife was vaccinated against RSV and flu during pregnancy and I Am assuming she also got TDAP and COVID booster? as well so baby has that line of defense for the next few months just in case. Anyway all this to say your wife needs help. She needs a therapist who specializes in OCD treatment and she may also need medication. Please tell her she is welcome to reach out to me if she needs someone who understands. Its a daily battle but I refuse to let my anxiety and OCD negatively affect my son so I fight that daily battle hard. Sending lots of care to your family.
15029,Put me out of my misery.: It sucks AND its better than lifelong pain from shingles neuropathy. And you just got your last shot woo hoo
15030,Shingles Vaccine & Tinnitus / HELP?: This sub is quite staunchly pro-vax and discussion of legit side effects will not be well received. You could try the Debate Vaccines sub; it tends the other way but has some genuinely knowledgeable members with balanced views.
15033,The shingles vaccine sucks.: We both just got our first shots a few days ago and were anticipating being knocked flat but in fact barely felt any effects. Luck of the draw I guess.
15035,Put me out of my misery.: Every vaccine fucks me up. Always has. That immune response kicks in and it takes me out for days. I hardly missed school as a kid due to actual illness. It was always vaccines Nothing has changed. Now I have to plan them out. Go and get it Friday after work enjoy my three day weekend sick and possibly call off on Tuesday. ETA those of you that have had shingles or are prone to getting it. Avoid peanut butterpeanuts There Is a protein in peanuts that can bring on shingles. Llysine is your friend Figured this out when my mom kept having recurring bouts of shingles
15036,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Older GenZ who had this post recommended to me I got the chickenpox vaccine got chickenpox anyway not a severe case but it was still all over my body my older brother who got it without the vaccine had pox in the back of his throat and everything though so I definitely still think the vaccine helped a lot and then got shingles at 13 or 14 because chickenpox was going around the younger grades at the K8 school I went to and it must have reactivated the virus. Basically what I Am saying is this could very well have happened to you anyway though I am sorry to hear you had it because dear god the itching will drive you insane
15040,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had it at age 32 and it was brutal. I had fever and plenty of itchy poxes. I was single at the time lived solo in a house not apartment but the little kids next door had it. I never saw or came in contact with these kiddos or even their parents at all. When the shingles vaccine became available I was eager to take it not wanting to repeat that fun time
15043,"Just got a flu shot and now I'm feeling under the weather. I decided to get the flu shot this year to protect myself and others, but now I'm experiencing flu-like symptoms. Body aches, fever, and a sore throat have been hitting me hard. I never expected to feel this bad after getting vaccinated. Hoping this passes soon!"
15046,Shingles Sucks: Interesting list. I am getting nerve pain in my left ear and shooting up the side of my head. Sometimes on the bottom of my feet. Did not know what it was so took a walk to get some fresh air and exercise yesterday. did nothing. Hot shower nope. Aleve. nada. Nyquil to get to sleep yea maybe  did not do anything for the pain but helped me ignore it enough to get some sleep. Ice packs seem to help too. Called my dad he gets it in the same place. odd.
15051,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I'm so sorry about your dad. I didn't mean to trivialize the condition, I'm just a big baby when it comes to pain. I am considered high risk due to other medical issues so I am definitely taking it seriously. They gave me a list of things to watch out for"
15053,I 31f received my papHPV results today and it came back with atypical endocervical cells and positive for non1618 high risk HPV. I Am freaking out because everything I read indicates that the fact that abnormal glandular cells were found means that there is immediate concern for precancerous or cancerous cells with possibility of needing a hysterectomy. Looking for guidance comfort knowledge etc. Here Is my history 12ish Got the HPV vaccine series  First pap at 21 negative pap no HPV test  24 ASCUS HPV followup was hrHPV positive no testing for whether it was 161845  25 negative pap no HPV test  26 negative pap no HPV test  28 negative pap no HPV test  31 AECNOS non1618 hrHPV positive I Am angry at myself for not getting tested every year I thought was doing everything right but now I feel like I missed my chance to detect things as early as possible. I Am also so frustrated that HPV is not automatically tested until you are 30 I feel like I may have been HPV positive that whole time and did not get to have a colposcopy because my paps were clear. Has anyone had a similar situation? I know I need to remain calm and wait for my colposcopy etc. but its so allconsuming to have this on my mind.
15062,Shingles Herpes Zoster Vaccine Outcome: I had the vaccine twice because I had shingles. Shingles was a bitch. Worse than childbirth. No joke. I also received herpes as a gift from a high school boy but never knew it until 15 years later. Thanks. The studies involve taking various antibiotics that work for herpes when you have been dx with fi bro myalgia or CFS. Some may work others may not do you will have to cycle through them. it is interesting I was just discussing this along with 2 other clinical trials with my doctor to see which one to try next. There is so much more research out there than there was even 4 years ago. So I am cautiously optimistic to go through the trial protocols and see if any work for me.
15070,Shingles Is NO Joke: I had shingles at 21 it was bad....
15072,Shingles vaccine experience: Second shot was worse. Its a mustdo. I had a grandpa go blind in one eye due to shingles.
15078,This week can be over now: Oh wow I feel so bad for your mom. Shingles on the face has got to be awful. I got shingles several years ago on my torso and it was miserable. I cannot imagine having it on my face
15081,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: I had pneumonia hepatitis B and shingles all at once. Ouch
15086,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: To be fair I know a few late 20 year olds and early 30 year olds who had shingles due to stress from schoolwork. One lady I used to babysit for in her mid30s got shingles during her pregnancy. But reading many of the comments here makes me think either people have not been aging gracefully or the ppl askingtelling them something just think everyone is older than the person truly is
15091,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I was starting to get shingles three or four times a year. I was trying to avoid the vaccine. But the doctors kept pushing it I got vaccinated now I have shingles constantly and I have chronic shingles I live off Valtrex. I have had to take the time to find other means so that my kidneys do not get ruined now from the veil of air. So now I take tagament for off label use for shingles. I also do reishi mushrooms include a thigh and this helps stop but I will replication. The vaccine was a big mistake it ruined what few T cells I have left
15092,Just wanted to let everyone know and offer hope on clearing hrhpv at 32. I had a negative pap with positive hpv 1 year ago even after getting the quadrivalent vaccine years ago I was very upsetscared and worried. I bought a bunch of supplements but did not actually end up taking them. I still drank but exercised pretty regularly. After one year my hpv is negative I just wanted to post because I remember how scared I was thinking I needed to quit ocps take a bunch of supplements and stop drinking. For most people it will clear on its own. Get vaccinated and do not fret.
15093,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My daughter had the chicken pox vaccine and had shingles 4x by the age of 24. She would trade that for natural chicken pox any day.
15096,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Someone in my family got a very bad bout of shingles as well. It was then followed by a catastrophic neuropathy that has left them in a constant state of pain. They are still in pain. Yes they got the mRNA vaccine. Yes I tried to prevent them.
15097,15 month old has rsv: Was he vaccinated? My little guy just had RSV and it was pretty bad and he was vaccinated Cannot imagine how it would have been were he not vaccinated.
15100,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I have not done those two. I have already had shingles and if you have not yet get the vaccine. It is brutal. My doctor's son lost an eye from shingles. I was lucky and only had it on my chest and back. I did the new Covid and flu yesterday and I feel like I got hit by a truck.
15106,Hi I live in Coquitlam BECAUSE Canada. On the afternoon of December 21 2024 a pharmacist injected a wrong vaccine to my wife. My wife was suppose to get RSV vaccine which is pregnancy safe. The pharmacist administered AREXvy vaccine instead. Although she did phoned in later and informed us and said that we should not be worried however the vaccine is NOT approved for pregnant individuals and in one of the studies preterm birth were seen. We did sent the prescription to the pharmacist which clearly mentioned the RSV vaccine. We did even signed a questionnaire that we are pregnant and informed the pharmacist verbally as well about our pregnancy. Also the vaccine which she gave is for older people above 60 years. My wife is 29 and by no means she looks 60. My wife has not seen any reactions so far but I am worried that in future if something happened to my baby or my wife then who will be responsible? What should I do legally in order to handle this situation and future unforeseen circumstances? Please help.
15108,Shingles vaccine experience: My singles shots went like yours sore arm was all. I had already made up my mind to get it as soon as I was eligible but then seeing half a dozen or so people suffer through shingles and their effects for years there was no way I was not getting it.
15109,Shingles at 35: I am so sorry how terrible. My husband was the sickest I Have ever seen him when he had it its awful that you had to feel like that and basically be ignored. Shingles is no joke. I hope you are on your way to complete healing.
15111,"Medical Exemption for Chickenpox Vaccine?: Hey! I just got accepted to nursing school and was looking at their required vaccines. My problem is that they require 2 varicella vaccines and I only had 1. I can't get the second because it's a live vaccine and I take methotrexate and a biologic. Is it possible to get a medical exemption? I swear I'm not an antivax moron. I've got all of my other vaccines and would get this one if I could, but I've already been told by my gastroenterologist and infectious disease doc that live vaccines are unacceptable. Update: Thanks for the advice! I did get a titer ordered by my primary care, but they said with my medical history and immune suppression they'd be surprised if I was positive. So I guess we can hope the clinical sites cooperate, or I get to go back to the infectious disease team and try to figure how to vaccinate me without killing me... Maybe I could delay methotrexate doses or something. Tbh, I'd like to figure out how to safely get the shot and develop antibodies. The last thing I was is to be an immunocompromised nurse working directly with patients with a contagious disease that I could be vaccinated for. I know I'll be working with infectious patients, but if there's a vaccine for the illness they have I'd strongly prefer to get it. For their sake and mine."
15112,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Late 20s. Mostly on the side. Friend in his early 30s got it on his face. Vaccinated now.
15115,Shingles vaccine: From people I Have asked that have received the vaccine they had the same reaction a few years ago but people that have had it in last 2 years said they have been fine
15116,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did not go to a chicken pox party since I had an older sister who got it and gave it to me but I feel yah on the shingles aspect. I had a massive flareup last winter and even wearing pants hurt it so bad that I cried. I had no idea what it was and went to an urgent care. Guy looked at it and asked if I had chickenpox as a kid and then said yup its definitely shingles then
15117,Hi forgive me if anything is formatted weirdly i never post on reddit. on thursday of last week i was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in my chest which then spread to my shoulder lower neck and majority of my arm all left side. this originally made me panic and believe i was experiencing heart related issues. this soon turned to terrible aching pain on mostly my arm and my head and not just uncomfortability. rash came up about a day or two after experiencing these pains on my left hand and now my shoulder. thought it was possibly ant bites or i had a random breakout to something in my house. never thought my pain would be connected to the rash in any way until my mother told me about her shingles experience. i had not even known shingles existed up until this point. Went to my pediatric doctor on monday they thought i had tore a muscle or had some sort of underlying heart problem. Got an EKG turned out fine sent home with instructions to keep an eye on the pain and if it got any worse to come back. just went back today Wed. due to pain steadily increasingly and being in a state of agony i could not move around the house without some sort of medication for pain. when i went they thought i did not have shingles since i never had chickenpox virus after me showing them my rash and telling them my symptoms i got the vaccine when i was younger i guess they overlooked that? and told me to get an xray to make sure everything was fine in my arm and shoulder since this was where i was experiencing most of my pain. they thought i was too young to have it aswell. doctor called my mom back an hour later they confirmed it was shingles after a frustrating wild goose chase of sending me all over the city to different hospitals to get tests done. got prescribed 800mg of Acyclovir 1 tablet every 4 hours for 5 days. my mom asked them to prescribe me something for pain because its at the point where i am constantly on the verge of tears. we are waiting for it to hopefully be put in. is there generally anything i can do to relieve this pain before any painkillers if i get any that is come in? the rash does not hurt as much unless touched or i bend my finger but its mostly just the aching in my arm that gets me
15118,41 and got Shingles: Oh god that is horrible. I honestly would not wish that pain on anyone. Just brushing my hair was torture washing it was a new level of pain I had not experienced even in childbirth.
15119,RSV vaccine decision ON: My baby 7 months got her RSV shot a month ago and I have no regrets. I Have seen her sick with colds and a stomach bug and it was heart wrenching. They are so small and there is really not much you can do to help them at this age when they are sick. Knowing that RSV can have much more serious implications than the common coldflu such as hospitalization and the need for a ventilator is enough reason for us. RSV can have long term effects asthma recurrent wheezing lung function impairment etc.. Ventilators run the risk of causing damage to a babys lungs and brain if they had to be on one. I Have seen videos of babys with RSV and it looks like something I hope we never have to experience. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk of the virus for our family at least. We also enjoy going to EarlyON classes and play dates and I feel much more comfortable being in these settings and out in public knowing my daughter is protected. Just noting that this is my personal opinion based on my experience and research  I do not judge anyone for the choices they make for their children
15120,Genital HSV1 or Recurrent Shingles?: I also thought I had shingles because it was so painful on my spine but then I had the same symptoms as you and I tested positive for hsv 2 antibodies
15123,: These white clotswere occasionally observable years ago but quite rare now. I have worked in the mortuary field for 32 years not seen them in years at post mortem. I am vaccine injured was forced to have it. and support Dr Campbell wholeheartedly but from my experience this is not a new thing.
15124,Shingles at 35: I feel that I was seen last week by a PA that I think was a young recent grad with no bedside manner whatsoever. I am 36. I Have had shingles once before when I was 12 and the tingleprickle and pain is something Ill never forget so when I got this rash on my face I knew immediately what it was based on how it felt before any blisters showed. I had also had a day of feeling unwell that week. She looked at me and asked me three time if I had been using any new face care products makeup laundry soap. When I said nothing has changed she asked are you sure.? When I explain that my eye was having an inexplicable itch as well she said I Am going to check you for a scratch on your eye because that would because itching. She AND the nurse both mentioned age and shingles and how its unusual in a young person. Its really NOT When I logged back into work a few of my coworkers had shingles in college my bosss daughter had shingles in high school. What is going on? Its not rare why is that the general belief. The entire time I was just relying over and over its shingles. I know this feeling. Its shingles she finally decided that she would treat me for it..but it was not as easy as it literally should have been. The blisters came the next day. Starting treatment as soon as possible is so important and the experience really made me frustrated.
15126,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: Me too I had chicken pox at an under a year old. I had a bad bike accident did not break anything but then had pimples that would not go away and then half my face and body were covered in shingles at 12
15131,Shingles vaccine: I got my two shingles shots a year ago I had to reaction to either shot. 
15135,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yea we kids seemed to get chicken pox at the same time thankfully but there was no party. My daughter had the chicken pox vaccine and had shingles at age 3. Luckily she did not have a horrible reaction just an area on her arm and she never acted like it bothered her. But still I am so sorry you are going through this.
15136,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Kicked my ass for 23 days.
15141,First shingles vaccine side effects: Did you have the week of total exhaustion with your first shot?
15144,Hi all I had my second abnormal Pap test a few weeks ago it was HR HPV positive and had ASCUS my Pap last year was HPV negative with ASCUS so I was scheduled for a colposcopy in early January. I immediately went to worst case scenario naturally but mostly came back to earth after a few days and was feeling cautiously neutral about the whole thing. However a few days ago I found a sore and swollen lymph node near the inguinal crease on the right side. So say I Am freaking out is kind of an understatement I came to terms with the possibility of precervical cancer but the possibility of metastatic cancer has me paralyzed with fear. The node is less than .5 in diameter sore when touched and firm but slightly squishy. I do not really have any other symptoms but I Am also on continuous BECAUSE so I do not menstruate and I know menstrual changes can sometimes be a symptom. Has anyone experienced something similar and it turned out okay? I Am not sure when I became infected with HPV i have had the same partner for 3 years no infidelity on either side.Both of us have had the gardasil quadrivalent as preteens. I know with cervical cancer lymph node involvement means at least stage 3 which is a horrifying thought. I Am definitely not too young for advanced cancer my aunt died of cervical cancer in her early 20s and I Am 26
15145,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had an irritated eye once and the eye doctor told me that I had shingles in my right eye socket. There was a thin vertical red line going down my forehead left a scar there to that eye. Afraid for my eyesight I got both shingles shots and it has never come back since. But now my right eye gets very tired easily and waters a lot. Last year I started seeing lightning at the edge of that eye so I went to the eye doctor. She said that it was posterior vitreous detachment and that if it happened again I was to come to her office immediately because it could turn into retinal detachment leading to permanent blindness. I am not big on vaccinations but see the shingles shots as definitely worth it.
15147,"Reoccurrence Panic Is Real: I've had shingles 17 times in 15 years. Every time it has been on the same side in roughly the same area of my body. If it is on the other side of your body, it is almost certainly NOT shingles. I am not a doctor, but I do know that it is already extremely rare to get it more than once, and even more rare for it to reoccur on the opposite side. Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon."
15149,The same for me. Never reacted to any vaccine until the shingles vaccine.
15151,Shingles vaccine experience: Had both. Only minor less than stellar feeling for about half a day. Did not stop me from 36 holes of disc golf and the six miles of hiking involved.
15155,My current symptoms are extreme nerve tingling and itching that moves around to different parts of my body constantly. Anxiety is very high and I feel so on edge. Dry mouth comes and goes. I have C677T heterozygous A1298C homozygous negative. Slow COMT. Backstory I started taking once a week 1000mg methylcobalamin injections as recommended by a doctor. I am also on the lowest dose of Tirzepatide and most on this medicine take weekly b12 so I was under the impression I was doing the right thing for myself. Please be kind I do realize it was not the right thing I have had zero side effects of the Tirzepatide except maybe some nausea at times. I started that in March started b12 in August but was not very consistent with it until September. On November 10 after a stressful night the night before I woke up feeling almost like I had shingles on the back of my head. This turned into a full flush of a panic attack and the nerve tingles and hot and cold started all over my body. We honestly thought I was having a stroke and my husband took me to the ER. We believe I took an injection the day before or that morning but truly cannot remember. That was 8 weeks ago and many threads on Reddit were sharing that tingling can be to low b12. So I did something dumb and continued it. The nerve things have continued. It was not until a thread I saw last week about overmethylating and slow COMT that it hit me that this could be why I still feel so weird. My last dose was last Thursday so a little over a week ago. Still no real reduction in symptoms I Have been chugging water infrared sauna etc. In the meantime I have spoken with the founder of the supplement Enlyte and he strongly suggested I get on it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE for my MTHFR and to start balancing things especially since I have been without folate. Many have warned this could make things worse at first which I have been feeling slightly. But he encouraged me to stick it out for 2 weeks where he believes Ill feel a reduction in symptoms and my nutrients will hopefully come back. Any help or advice is appreciated. I have been through a lot with my health with Hashimotos my labs that I got a few weeks ago look the best they have in 10 years so we do not believe these symptoms are related and very severe endometriosis. My husband also got diagnosed with MS last year so this has been triggering to me. I do not know if I should be patient and wait it out if this all really does sound like overmethylating or if I should continue to seek answers. Some have suggested potentially a mycotoxin test or that it could be histamine relatedhowever it came on so suddenly like out of the blue my body said NO to more b12. Thank you. And again please be kind my mental health is hurting with this and the state of our many friends in Los Angeles.
15156,Cognitive Load of low vision: I actually forgot the worst symptom I had when I wrote the original post the nerve that is so damaged from shingles started hurting again when driving at night became hard. It went from this sucks to okay I guess I Am dying and will have lesions in the morning. No lesions ever appeared. I walked into the surgery center with this sucks pain and left drugged up with no pain and have had almost no pain since. That nerve will never be completely quiet but since the surgery it is back to the postshingles normal I was used to. Glad I did not try the crazy diet my doctor said would fix the nerve pain. I got a new doctor.
15164,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: My shingles felt like someone was constantly stabbing me in the back with a knife.
15165,Sarah provides a day 5 shingles update: Yeah for sure. Was Not calling you out just wanted people to not be freaked out thinking its highly contagious or anything. I would not be out and about like she is for sure. Getting pox as an adult is much worse than having it as a child Do you remember yrs ago moms would have chick pox parties? I bet some still do that. My brother got it at boot camp and was really sick and had a really high fever for over a week.
15167,I Am still pissed my parents forced jabbed me as a baby up until I was 9 and told them I are not getting anymore vaccines this was right after I was forced to get a vaccine and then got shingles 2 weeks later. I Am 36 now and havnt got a vaccine since. I never get fevers . Or truly sick
15170,Shingles vaccine experience: I have peripheral neuropathy which is nerve damage. The pain is always worse at night. This is why I got the shingles vaccine. Its the worst thing that is ever happened to me
15171,Shingles and other Vaccines: I saw my mother suffer terribly with shingles outbreaks. David Letterman never missed a days work was out for six weeks because of shingles and it was in his EYE. He said it was the most painful experience he ever had. I never forgot how he explained how it affected him. No way in hell I was going to chance that Only one of them had me in bed shivering for 24 hours and was completely worth it
15172,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 1978. I caught it the good old fashioned way when I was 12 years old. Also got bronchitis at the same time. It damaged my lungs gave me asthma and made me more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. That is why my doctor thinks I have had pneumonia six times. So glad my kids are vaccinated and will not have to deal with that crap.
15176,My side effects have been so minimal until I went up to 7.5 2nd dose. I will not lie I was starting to think people were exaggerating about the nausea and inability to eat but now I get it. Just curious what dose did others start to experience these effects and what do you do daily to keep them at bay?
15178,Do you suggest getting my 11 year old daughter the HPV vaccine? Has anyone ever had adverse side effects from it? I had the hpv vaccine as a teenager and had no side effects and went on to have a very easy time conceiving my 4 children. My husband made a comment about what if it paralyzes her or she has a bad reaction and that has me afraid and second guessing getting it for her. All advice is welcomed.
15182,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Nope vaccinated. Born in 93 got the shot around 9798 most likely. My dad got shingles multiple times in adulthood and this last bout came in the same few months as COVID and woke up a bunch of autoimmune stuff. Its no joke. I Do Not Know if vaccine could potentially save me from that but I hope so.
15183,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same I had to get chicken pox vaccine 3 x as an adult before I showed immunity no clue why
15184,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: Yea. Shingles is horrible I mean I had 34 flare in my early stressed single mom forties. On my side where you bend and sweat. I had to work. I surveyed and evaluated manufacturing and environmental sites in the heat. So I guess I got it for rest of my life. But since then I ve seen seniors that were sooooo bad. No sleep. Just pain And if you have a young woman that is pregnant in your life you got to stay away The baby is at risk
15189,Has anyone gotten acupuncture here in Syracuse? My nerve pain has shot through the roof since I got Shingles. My doctor agreed that acupuncture is better before going the nerve block route.
15193,"Postherpetic Neuralgia: I got shingles at the end of May last year. I actually didn't get that bad of a rash but I got very bad nerve pain and allodynia. My doctor put me on 1800 mg of gabapentin (started me at 300 but we had to keep increasing because the pain was bad) and referred me to a pain specialist. I didn't like the pain specialist because he spent 2 minutes with me and prescribed me opioids. I didn't want take opioids so I stopped seeing him but stayed on the gabapentin. The gabapentin helps block 90-100% of my pain. Sometimes it 100%, sometimes I get breakthrough pain or itching, but not often. If I reduce my dose I get pain immediately. Like if I take 300 at 2pm instead of 600, by 6pm I have noticable, but manageable pain. My question is, is this pain from my PHN or is it a side effect of withdrawal? I really don't know. I would like to get off gabapentin because I am 100% convinced it is causing me fatigue and lack of focus which makes it hard for me to do my job. But so does pain. Help."
15198,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles at 28 and it was horrendously painful I could barely wear a shirt. Did not know anything about shingles until I went to the doctor.
15201,Vaccine Schedule: We were able to stay in the room for 1015 min after our LO's vaccines to monitor for allergic reactions.
15203,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: Earlier this year March like you I had facial shingles kick off Ramsay Hunt and apparently transverse myelitistorso numbness that trashed my balance to the point I was on a walker then a cane then thankfully walking on my own again. The Ramsay Hunt retreated with antivirals the numbness slowly receded across the months. My vision was impacted it was like I was wearing somebody else's glasses but. like my other symptoms that was not permanent. I do not mind telling you it scared the crap out of me. I still have scabbyflaky areas and jawline soreness and a lesion inside my nose but that is so much better than I was. I have had all the available Covid boosters but have not noticed a correlation between the shots and shingles relapses but who knows? Anyway like you mine was initially misdiagnosed even though I knew what shingles onset feels like. Primary care thought it was TMJ. It took my ophthalmologist to prescribe valacyclovir. If I did not need my Primary care to treat my hypertension until I can ID another practice I would probably never go back there. Anxiety? I would love for your doctors to experience your symptoms and not be anxious. Your continued pain or PHN could be because the antivirals were not prescribed sooner and thus were less effective in staunching the infection. Or like me you could have suffered nerve damage during that time mine is from my first shingles ten years ago. I have read some on internal shingles but truly know little about it. But believe me you have my complete sympathies. I hope you and your doctors are able to come to a legitimate diagnosis that leads to treatment that works for you. Shingles symptomseffects are all over the map and are hard to track as a predictable pattern. Take care of yourself and keep searching for answers. Regardless of what some doctors seem to think shingles is not the equivalent of the common cold in old people.
15206,Thought it was heat rash lol: Mine started right near my groin so I just thought it was an ingrown hair. It wasn't. It was the worst rash I've ever had in my life and I didn't wear pants for two weeks. I didn't get the antivirals until two weeks later because I too am a dumbass and hate going to the doctor lol. I was definitely too late. Two months later I got them again- but on the opposite side. Got antivirals ASAP but the damage was done. Sigh. Anyways- something that helped a ton with itchiness was CBD + THC ointment if you can get your hands on it!
15207,RSV vaccine?: My 2 month old got it on October 2nd. If you are talking about Beyfortus its not a vaccine rather an antibody injection. Anyway my LO showed no reactions.
15208,The Mounjaro back pain is out of control: The pain in the neck shoulder region is common but only on first or second injection and does not recur.
15209,Shingrix if you have never had chicken pox?: Yep. I got shingles in my 20s and had an itchy spot on my back for over a decade that would flare up any time I had any kind of stress or cold. It finally went away recently shortly after getting the covid vaccine of all things not saying it was definitely that but there is apparently a very small link between the covid vaccine and shingles both positive and
15211,At the end of last year I got RSV then 2 weeks later I was slammed with COVID first time having it vaccinated and since the beginning of this year my very under control asthma went haywire. I went from running 5k10miles to not being able to walk to my car in my driveway without losing my breath. I went from never needing my rescue inhaler to needing symbacort 25 times a day my rescue inhaler usually once a day and Spiriva once a day. I am under the care of a pulmonologist and I am getting some tests done on Friday. I really hope there is recovery in my future I want to run amd swim again How are you guys holding up?
15212,Was at work and felt something itching and went to scratch and I then felt the bumps through my shirt they stopped itching and no longer hurt but the bumps remain. Mom suggested shingles but I Have never had chicken pox and had vaccine I Am 26 no recollection of being bitten by any bugs to my knowledge either
15213,Hmm friends husband shingles and a couple of others. Van island. vaccine They wanted to give him another shot of a shingles vaccine hyper homestead father with eco lovin wife with forever allergies. They are very emf sensitive generally. So that fits immune compromised
15215,Pharmacy gave my dad an extra dose of a vaccine he had already taken: That Is what I Am not sure about either. The data seems really thin on this especially for a shingles vaccine. There could be adverse effects but a lot of those may be subclinical. From my POV this should be treated like a medical error because he got an extra dose of a medication due to someone is negligence or system error. But I could be completely wrong about this as well hence why I posted here.
15217,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles when I transferred to university. It was hard to go to class when wearing a shirt was painful. It infuriates me that the vaccine is only recommended for old people. College is stressful and it is not that uncommon to get it at that time. I recently got a rash they thought might be shingles again at first. Its around my eyes and they did not even tell me to see an ophthalmologist. Many doctors do not understand how dangerous it is or that it can because blindness and other severe sequelae. They really should take it more seriously.
15219,I was in bed 1 entire day with aches pains swollen lymph nodes. I had shingles a few years ago in my 40s I Have been counting down to the vaccine. Shingles felt like someone held a blow torch to my face would not extinguish it for days. Very painful. Dreading 2 too.
15221,Did not have an issue... Shingles arm was a bit more sore Month later on Dr advice had the RSV shot as well... that was 325 each.
15224,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: My wife is 47 and got it last year and has it now all this past week. She is hurting I feel so bad I feel like I cannot do anything and I do not want to even touch her. She Is been in pain all week feels like she is dying.
15227,RSV Vaccine: Thank you that is great to hear. With his other shots he has had a slight fever and been sleepy. I was just curious if this would be better or worse. I was hoping better since it was the antibodies instead of a typical vaccine. So far no reaction at all.
15229,Shingles vaccine: My husband had it two years ago. Sore arm withe first shot and maybe two hours of flu like symptoms with the second he took a nap and was good after that. I Am due to get the two shots. I never had chicken pox but my doctor says it provides protection against that as well. I know shingles is miserable and everyone says chicken pox is awful the older you get it.
15237,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: I Have had shingles still have slight neuralgia even today. I would take a day of feeling like a bag of shit over that.
15240,I have had nerve pain down my left arm all week. It spread to my armpit late Thursday night. I also noted a weird spot on my back midweek but I assumed it was acne. I Have been super fatigued had a plugged left ear and felt unwell all week but had chalked it up to allergies and return to work teacher. After I got out of the shower this morning I noticed a rash in my left armpit and a rash surrounding that weird spot. Both looked similar. Both looked like shingles. Also had minor fever. Walkin clinic diagnosed me with shingles and gave me an antiviral and a pain med. It has since spread to my face rash only no pain. The doctor did not say much else in terms of treatment or best practice. What precautions should my husband take? Can I work? What else do I need to be doing?
15246,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom sent me to so many houses to try to get me to catch it. When I did finally get it I was out of school for 3 weeks. The doctors in my small town had never seen a case so bad. They counted over 150 just on my faceneckchest before they gave up. They were inside my ears on my ear drum. Inside my nose my throat. Genitals too. It was fucking gnarly. I Have got quite a few scars from it. I did kind of get some karmic relief when the next month she had shingles
15249,Under 35 with Shingles?: I am 21 and i just about finished recovering from it. Sucks ass but I have been also catching colds left and right since October so my immune system is just down
15251,After having had shingles twice. The drag from the shot was worth it. They hurt like nothing else.
15252,I dreaded getting my shingles vaccine because my husband felt miserable after his less so the second dose but I had no reaction at all. I hope you feel better soon And do get your second dose shingles is worse
15253,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: Get well soon. I had a terrible headache the first 2 days. First night i felt cold and sweated fever like symptoms. After day 3 everything seems back to normal.
15259,My neighbour has just told me about her brother. Had every jab booster going including flu pneumococcal shingles has had 10 DVT's since his first MRNA jab. 10th DVT diagnosed last week yet next week he is getting a flu shot covid booster flying off on hols
15260,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Thankfully the worst is past now just some issues in the area around the injection site. I had every single one of the possible side effects but yes still better than shingles. Not looking forward to round 2 in a couple of months. At least this time Ill have a clue what I Am in for. Good luck with yours in a couple of years
15265,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: I got it for my son when he was a couple weeks old. Cost before insurance was 750 but insurance covered it 100.
15272,Shingles with PHN after: That hurts just to look at that. I am sorry to hear that. In my case the gabopentin started to help some but I can tell that if I came off of it that the pain would be much more intense. Hopefully the Lyrica works for you Let me know if it does
15275,I hope you feel well today. That Shingles vaccine hurts
15277,Shingles Sucks: Yeah it suuuuuper sucks. I had it when I was 17. Hurts so bad you do not even want clothes touching your middle.
15278,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am pretty sure I had my first occurrence of shingles a couple years ago. It was a rash on my side at the bottom of my ribs with blisters and it hurt. But compared to some of the horror stories I Have heard it was a minor nuisance at worst. If I Am right and it was shingles I consider myself extremely lucky its mild in my case.
15283,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My first shot destroyed me. Worst vaccine shot I've ever had.
15284,"Shingles vaccine side effects: (30F) got her first dose yesterday. Woke up with a swollen arm and intense soreness. Throughout the day, she developed a low-grade fever, body aches, and fatigue. Feeling worried about the prospect of experiencing these side effects again with the second dose. Has anyone else encountered such a challenging reaction to the shingles vaccine? Any tips for managing the symptoms?"
15288,Second Shingles Shot: I had some side effects with the first shot mostly fatigue not as manybad with the second shot. By the time I got the vaccines I knew enough close friends or family members who had it that the side effects were not anything compared to what they went through.
15289,My mom had covid then got the shingles shot and now has shingles so it definitely does
15290,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles at 36. I had a newborn and thought the pain in my shoulder blade was related to poor sleep. After I was diagnosed I asked around about if it would even be possible to get the vaccine and I was told no unless your doctor says it is medically necessary it would not be covered by insurance. That was 5 years ago and since then I have read quite a few instances of people around my age developing shingles as well so hopefully things are near a tipping point in regards to vaccine access.
15295,a quick follow up: 12 months after a shingles flare you can get a shingles vaccination. I have had shingles once had the vaccination and never had them again so far. Fingers crossed. Shingles can be very debilitating and miserable to live with.
15296,"Just got shingles for the first time, I'm sorry for you all.: I'm in my mid 20s and I just got shingles for the first time. Started getting a weird pain in my elbow several days ago that I dismissed as hyper extension, only it kept getting worse, then I got the worst arm pain of my life. Felt like my arm had been hit by a truck or was trapped under a boulder, and I noticed an unexplained rash on the same arm. Now I'm running a fever and my arm is no better. Hopefully the painkillers and antivirals the doctor prescribed helps. Even worse because I just had a root canal done last week because I was having the worst tooth pain of my life. Can't seem to catch a break. To anyone else suffering though, you're in good company. Edit: And to make things even sillier, I've never even had chickenpox. The shingles is from my childhood chickenpox vaccine. I think I'm the textbook least likely group to get shingles, bad luck I suppose."
15297,My pharmacist gave me a heads up that the first shot would knock me back a bit. It did but I was better within 24 hours. I had shingles about 7 years ago and it was a miserable experience. I Am glad you came thru it
15298,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Antidepressants really helped mine I Do Not Know the science behind it but i was so sad and depressed because I did not think it would ever go away. A month ago I started antidepressants after a new dr suggested it. Not only is my anxiety much better But so is the nerve pain I Am 34 and got it in April of this year in my eye and forehead area. Super bad case of it too My face is still weird feeling when I touch it But the actual pain is gone. It feels tingly every now and then and some days are better than others. Stress definitely makes it worse.
15299,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Got mine last week but combined it with flu covid and t dap. Pretty sure it was shingles 2 that kicked my as s though.
15304,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: My wife was 44 when she had shingles and it triggered Bells Palsy which temporarily paralyzed half of her face. I am getting that vaccine as soon as possible.
15307,"Flu Vaccine causing issues: Hey everyone, I recently received the flu vaccine as part of my routine vaccinations. To my surprise, the vaccine seems to have triggered a flare-up of my symptoms. Prior to getting vaccinated, I was managing quite well with minimal blood and improved bowel movements. However, post-vaccination, I've noticed an increase in blood in my stool and my bowel movements have become looser and more painful. It's only been a couple of days since I got the flu shot, and I'm quite concerned about these new developments. Has anyone else encountered similar issues after receiving the flu vaccine? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance for your support."
15309,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: Getting Shingles (July -Aug of '22, I was 44) was one the worst experiences I ever had; it lasted over a month. All the muscles impacted, which are my left flank to front ribs, still have nerve pain and will flair up for various reasons. Shingles is no joke; good job getting the vax. As I write this, I can feel it."
15310,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Go get it. Had my 2nd shot last Friday. Slept all day Saturday felt pretty good Sunday and Monday. A family member had it recently and OMG it sounded terrible
15313,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Mine also blistered. I am saying the itching did not start until after they started to heal. It could have been shingles but you originally presented it as on both shoulders and down both arms at once and that is unlikely to be shingles as described.
15316,I got the flu vaccine got the flu twice. I got the Shingles vaccine got shingles. I did not get the C vaccine I DID NOT get Covid. No more vaccines for me.
15318,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Herpes zoster usually returns when your immune system is under pressure like due to stress from the new job or indeed having to work on multiple vaccines at the same time. After you have chicken pox the virus can hide in nerves just like herpes simplex in your mouth and come out just like a cold sore when it gets the opportunity.
15319,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am one of the rarities and got it twice. First time was from the vaccine directly the second time was from a friend in the neighborhood who was a chicken pox party victim and I almost died because of the fevers. Still trying to beat my high score of 105F. Please can we stop these parties because me almost dying just so my friends mom could make sure her daughter would get it early is not reasonable. Plus I am covered in scars from ALL THE ITCHING. Also... I hate Calamine lotion and the smell makes me violently sick now. I just do not think any of it is worth it. Edit Before people gripe about the vaccine causing it actually was caused by it and is in my medical records as the because. Not posting this because they are personal but just know there is indeed proof.
15320,Shingles vaccine second dose: I barely had any reaction to either one but I am a dialysis patient and therefore highly immunocompromised. The vaccine may not have taken very well with me.
15321,The second dose was not as rough for me. I understand the apprehension but shingles is absolutely horrible. Just make a plan stay in bed fav snacks and a good book and shows to watch. Might ease some apprehension
15323,Chickenpox Vaccine and Genital Herpes: The relation between Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex Virus - Research Paper : [<url>](<url>) Chickenpox Vaccine in stopping Herpes outbreaks - Study : [<url>](<url>) Summary: -Getting Chickenpox naturally does not provide the same protection as the vaccine. The vaccine is superior to the wild-type because it reduces Shingles (Herpes Zoster) -There is a large number of anecdotal evidence that there is a connection between Herpes Zoster and HSV -Chickenpox Vaccine has been shown to stop Herpes outbreaks
15326,I did both AND a shingles shot. Worst was I had to sleep on my back. But I have not ever had a reaction besides the stabbing trauma so I Am a definite outlier.
15327,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I have Shingles in my 30s. IT. Fin. SUCKS. Yes I had gotten the vaccine but I am one of the unlucky few like 3 where the vaccine did not work. There are times where I put serious consideration into chewing off the offending limb just to get away from the agony. No I cannot get the shingles vaccine because my insurance will not cover it because I am not over 50 and I do not have an extra 500 to spend at the moment. This kid now has that to look forward to.
15329,Take it easy and get feeling better. I got those two PLUS the shingles vaccine yesterday. Feeling great today. Irritates my spouse to no end that I seem to never react to vaccines. That combo laid her out for 3 days.
15336,Hello Wondering what others did around this time of year. We of course want to see people but do not want to risk his health either once he goes home. My son was born 283 on 72624 and has been in the hospital for 80 days today. He was intubated for a week then bubble CPAP for a while then RAM then HFNC and has been on room air for the last few days doing great Doctors notes say he had moderate BPD. He already got the RSV vaccine and his one and two month vaccines. Hes doing very well just working on feeding at this point. I did ask the pulmonologist and he said since we will not be flying anywhere we should not have to do anything special just have people wash hands and maybe a mask at most and we of course will follow anyall recommendations from doctors but just curious what others did around this time of year. Thanks
15340,"?? Strange reaction after HPV vaccine ?? I recently got the HPV vaccine and I've noticed these strange red bumps appearing on both of my hands. They come and go, sometimes turning red and feeling a bit rigid. They have grown in size slowly and occasionally hurt when touched. I'm not sure what triggers them to flair up. Any similar experiences or advice?"
15341,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox in grade school before the vaccine was available but there is now a vaccine against shingles which I recently got. Felt like I had the flu for a couple days.
15343,AG something important to note. Getting the shots will NOT guarantee you will never get shingles. They will help the case you get to be less painful. I know this because while both my wife and I got the shots she got shingles a few months ago. Her pain lasted 3 months.
15344,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Shingles is brutal so yes it IS
15345,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine and still got h chicken pox
15348,Tingling in old spots. Is it possible it is not proceeding?: Still happens to me I have had Shingrix. Hope it stays away
15351,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My 32 weeker got Beyfortus right before discharge around 36 weeks. He did great with it no side effects and has continued to do well.
15352,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles at 36 started out feeling like I pulled my back then came the itchy painful rash. I went to the hospital because I went to catch something my wife tossed to me and started convulsing. I could not bear it and scratched them and now have nerve damage on my back.
15355,Shingles vaccine: I know My almost 80 yr old mom got shingles on her face a few years ago and not only did it recur in the same place shortly after it cleared but she has permanent neuralgia across that side of her lower jaw from it no thanks no way no how.
15356,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Like having the flu without the fever. Bad body aches and headache for two days. Still way better than getting shingles
15357,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Definitely shingles. I had it on my chest back and armpit. But only the armpit and chest ones had welts like that. Llysine OTC pregabalin prescription and valacyclovir prescription worked. But valacyclovir is most beneficial when taken at the onset of symptoms and not once its reached that stage.
15358,Shingles vaccine: I got both shots a few years ago. Side effects were not fun but much better than shingles.
15360,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I have read about it but it was not a thing in my small Midwestern childhood town. I did however get chicken pox as a little kid and gave it to my brother sorry bro and experienced the joy of Shingles first hand a couple of years ago NO FUN at all. It was on my head and felt like I imagine anyways I was being stabbed in the head every ten to forty seconds. I never want to experience Shingles ever again 010.
15362,Hi all Never thought my first reddit post would be about this but here we go. I am 33F and in my 4th flare of shingles. Had it in 2012 Right foot 2018 Right lower back 2024 Early AprilRight Elbow and now again 2024 started May 26th. This time it is on both forearms a total of about 6 spots. I also have Ulcerative Colitis Diagnosed 2018. Just had colonoscopy and in full medical remission. Yay I did a Teladoc appointment to get the antivirals Tuesday morning since Monday everything was closed due to Memorial day and I was not sure Sunday that this was shingles since it is not presenting normally. When I spoke with Teladoc the doctor told me to follow up with my primary care to see if they can do bloodwork on why I keep getting this so often. Especially since it is presenting to large and spread out this time and bilateral shingles is rare so there might be something going on with me. I saw my primary care doctor yesterday and left in tears. She basically googled the whole 30 minutes she spoke with me. She could not give me any advice or instruction other than to get the Shingrex vaccine. She said there are no tests or bloodwork she could do. Basically that I would have to see a dermatologist and by the time I could the shingles would be likely gone and they would not be able to help since they would need to see it. All she could tell me is that I am immunocompromised since I do have Ulcerative Colitis. She did say my medication for that is NOT a immunosuppressant. She does not know if the disease is on its own. I was not so upset until it recurred a month apart from the last outbreak. I few years in between I can understand but this is just total torture. I do also have a 19 month old daughter and the constant trying to cover my arms in this Florida heat does not help with stress. Does anyone else have Ulcerative Colitis and have recurring Shingles outbreaks? Has anyone had the Vaccine and the outbreaks stopped? I read the vaccine is only effective for 710 years and there is no booster so what do we do after the effectiveness wears off?? I also want to note that I have no insurance anymore as of tomorrow so I am really just looking for any advice anyone has gotten from their own doctors since I will not be able to move forward with tons of expensive medical bills for this.
15363,RSV vaccine: I had mine yesterday alongside the flu jab and I have not noticed any change.
15364,No clue why shingles is trending. However I do suggest the shot to those in the age bracket who have had chicken pox before. My mom had shingles and it was really bad. She had a rash and was in terrible pain for MONTHS. She lost feeling in the entire area never recovered it.
15365,Shingles vaccine: I pay out of pocket too Costco is usually the best if one so close. First dose was just a slightly sore arm. Getting second dose tomorrow. Unfortunately I think because some people get bad reactions we all worry more. Good to allow yourself some extra time after the shots to recover though. My dear friends mom has severe neuralgia from shingles. It has been decades of intractable pain. NO THANK YOU Bring on the shots
15366,"Never had chickenpox, can I get shingles?: I absolutely believe in the vaccine and I have a friend who will probably be blind in one eye due to ongoing complications from shingles. But I've never been infected so that's my concern of taking a vaccine (albeit safe) for no reason."
15368,Is exercise stress?: I think you would have to ask your doctor. I had shingles twice in the last two years. The first time was on my face and the second time was inside my ear and on the back of my ear and neck. I am trying to get vaccinated for it even though I am not 50 yet. I have some ongoing pain from the ear shingles and I never want to deal with shingles again.
15371,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Had both last year with a sore arm. I just showed up at CVS. I was told if you are over 50 insurance generally covers. Mine did 100. I Am a baby and hate shots but I had a mild case and the doctor said I Am more likely to get it again. I got it when i woke up with a slight no shingles rash 2 days before a trip. I realized I could have ruined my and my husbands vacation. That motivated me to get the vac. No regrets.
15372,Shingles vaccine: Yep shingles nearly made me go blind in one eye.
15374,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My husband just went and got his shingles vaccine. Ill be going soon to get mine.
15375,Acyclovir dosage: I started on 800mg 5 times a day for 5 days the first And I really hope only time I had shingles. It stopped it in its tracks pretty quickly. I had spots on my back one on my side and three on my stomach which never joined up thankfully.
15376,"Acute hepatitis of ""unknown aetiology"" starts during pandemic. Is this related to my friend getting shingles after her vax?"
15381,New Shingrix data demonstrate 100 vaccine efficacy in the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over in China: I doubt it s related. I ve been vaccinated with Shin gri x for years and still managed to get HSV 2.
15383,Dupixent has been a gamechanger for me. Been on it for about a year and a half. I had some redness at the shot site when I first started taking it but that went away after switching from the autoinjector to the syringe. This last dose in my thigh was unusually painful the next day and I developed a red burning patch at the injection site. Dermatologist said it was a normal reaction. Days later it burned more and started looking like blisters and about a week after the initial shot it was diagnosed as shingles. I am on an antiviral now which is helping. Just wanted to give a warning if anyone has a weird reaction like mine to get it checked and keep in mind that shingles are apparently a known Dupixent side effect It is a huge bummer because I cannot take my other medications while I have shingles.
15388,My Mom had the RSV Pnuemonia and flu shot earlier this year unknown to me and she has had Covid pneumonia twice and shingles. Sickest she has ever been.
15389,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox before the vaccination was available. One sister brought it home and parents but me and the third sister in bed with her. Standard practice back in the day. Flash forward to when the vaccine became available all our kids are vaccine Husband develops Shingles he had CP as a child too. I start doing a lot of research and discovered that Shingles is SPIKING in age group under 30. The vaccine prevents Chicken Pox but does not prevent Shingles. Husband and I have had the Shingles vaccine. Did not work for him. Waiting for them to start advertising to young people to get that vaccination too. And Shingles is a BITCH He had it on the left side of his body buttocks to left foot. Foot became numb after the intense pain. Nerve damage resulted. The nerves are slowly healing. He walks with a limp. Initially could not lift his toes off the ground. Its taken 5 months and he can now lift his toes 14 off the ground now. Still walks with a limp. I hope you the pain ends quickly and you heal from any lingering effects quickly.
15390,Asked my sister not to come over because her kids have rsv AITA?: NTA. I got the RSV vaccine while pregnant to protect my baby. He is 8 weeks old now and he still got it about a week ago  he is really unwell and miserable. we do not even know how he got it as my toddler was not attending nursery at the time and we are very cautious about hygiene when out of the house for this very reason. This just demonstrates how contagious it is  your baby will more than likely get it if your sister visits and it is really selfish of her to still push for it.
15395,Shingles? Rinvoq? Pain before rash after Covid booster: I have had no trouble with Covid boosters. The risks of Covid for immune suppressed individuals is much higher than the risk of adverse effects. Any immune response has the potential to temporarily exacerbate your autoimmune diseases. Yes you will feel crappy for a few days after any vaccine. That is your immune system reacting to the vaccine and creating antibodies. It is possible to have pain or tingling before blisters appear with shingles. As you are preparing to go on holiday a call to your doctor would not hurt. It is extremely unlikely that the covid vaccine triggered shingles.
15399,Do you suggest getting my 11 year old daughter the HPV vaccine? Has anyone ever had adverse side effects from it?: I had the HPV vaccine in my 20s. It prevented me from contracting the type of HPV that causes genital warts. I work in vaccines. When people bring up the effects or unknowns of the newer ones I often go back to the old vaccinetetanus. Any man I have met working with metal was taught to get his tetanus shot. They do not question it. And tetanus shots are known in extremely rare causes to trigger GBS temporarily.
15400,First time getting singles on my forehead eyelid and scalp any tips for face wash and healing?: My first bout of facescalp shingles was a whopper too. The Oxycodone will likely have you sleeping around the clock but be sure to set an alarm to keep up with your medications. It is important to stay current on the antivirals and as you know Prednisone needs to be taken on schedule including the tapering down. And drink as much water as you can. If Valtrex gives you nausea tea and crackers usually stay down best for me. Shingles for weight loss is the worst diet idea ever. The blisters will dry up unless they have broken otherwise they will scab. Either way do your level best not to touch them to preclude scarring. As for the fluid in the blisters it does not spread Shingles but can spread chicken pox so be careful around people who never had chicken pox until the blisters are dry. Use gentle soap to wash like Cetaphil and if that is too irritating just water is fine as you have already found. My worst itching after healing was on my scalp but seriously do not scratch as you can scar as well as make bald spots. I do not have those but the internet pictures are tragic. I am still taking antihistamines for the itching eleven years later. I only wish money hung around as long as shingles aftereffects. The nerve pain is in a class of its own like needles working from the inside out. And those road flares in the jaw are the worst. That will last a while but eventually fade. And the headaches took a long time to subside but eventually did. I hope the Gabapentin works to diminish your pain after you are off the Oxycodone the side effects were too much for me but other people say it helps them. Good luck with this I am so sorry you are suffering. Not to make you paranoid but make notes of new symptoms as they happen especially with your eye. Oxycodone and Gabapentin can mess with remembering things and you need to get medical help if a symptom turns out to be more important than you think. I hope you feel better soon and that this is your one and only outbreak. And remember the pain is keeping you from getting restful sleep even with the drugs and that is part of feeling so hopeless you are exhausted. You will get through this though. Take care sweetie.
15403,Minor Signs after a vaccine: Hi youtopflobosss It is normal to feel some minor effects after a vaccine. Having a sore arm is common and sometimes you might get a little fatigued or feel off for a day or two. It sounds like you are just having the usual reaction since you are not feeling sick otherwise. It should start getting better soon but if anything feels worse or does not go away it might be worth checking in with a doctor just to be safe. Hope you are feeling better soon.  Nina from Oura Social Care
15405,"In need of advice! I abruptly stopped taking my cortiment medication and received the hepatitis vaccine. Since then, I've been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks, leading me to seek medical help for chest pain. Tests are inconclusive so far. Has anyone else dealt with anxiety related to cortiment, vaccines, and medication changes? Any insights or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated."
15406,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I currently have shingles across my face and in my eye. The pain stabbing is excruciating. I thought I had more time to get the vaccine before this would happen 50.
15407,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Had no problems with five COVID shots too.
15408,Try to take an antiinflammatory AdvilMotrin and fluids before a shingles vaccine. That thing will knock you off your feet for a couple of days and the antiinflammatory will be your cushion.
15411,Anyone Under 50 got their shingles vaccine: I have a legit autoimmune disorder and got Shingrix when my doc told me to which I think was around 50. Trust me it sucked. Knocked me out both times.
15413,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I had it wrapped around my side from the middle of my back to my stomach. The pain was seriously unbelievable and unrelenting. It felt like someone was holding a blowtorch to the outside of my skin while pouring ice water down the inside of my skin. Whenever I get a slight itch or tingle or something in the area where the rash was I still get a jolt of fear that it is coming back or something.
15414,I stopped taking vaccine back in the 90s when I was told the flu vaccine was only a 5050 chance of working. My fiancee's boss got the shingles vaccine was in the hospital for 2 weeks now cannot walk normally.
15419,Just took my first dose about 20 minutes ago. What should I expect today?: I Am on the first week. I did not notice anything until over 24 hours later. I have a very full feeling. I have been nauseous for three days straight and well as actually having to stay in the bathroom. I Am trying to figure out how to get through second week.
15420,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I caught it when I was about ten or eleven after my younger siblings seven and three or so did. They had a few pox and were done with it. I got it so had I had a few places on my body where the pox were not connected and I was completely out of commission and doped up on Benadryl for a month. So yeah chick pox parties made sense at the time. Before the vaccine there was basically a 100 chance that you were going to get it. I think the r0 of the virus is 10 or something like that so getting it out of the way early was the best practice unless you wanted your kid to be miserable and end up having pictures taken for a medical textbook it was so bad.
15423,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: No. I was born in 1989 and got the vaccine.
15425,Shingles vaccine: I have had both shingles shots never had any reaction
15431,Shingles vaccine at 27?: When I got shingles I could not pee for four days my wife had to learn how to catherize me. It was not fun.
15432,I respect your opinion Frank but I know to many people including myself that were injured. I have a friend that told me he does not know anyone that was injured as I was standing in front of him with Shingles on my face??? 6x more likely after vaccination.... Safe?? effective?
15433,hi all I was hoping for some insight into what this rashblister patch is on my right shoulder pictures included. Of course only a doctor can truly diagnose it but I have horrible insurance my doctor is booked out for months and the clinic I am covered through has temporarily stopped ordering labs and prescriptions for patients for some reason something about state budget cuts and liability or something i do not know. I went in for an exam there today and the doctor on call said it looked like shingles?? I have never had chicken pox but am vaccinated for it. I thought you could only get shingles after an actual case of chicken pox not just a vaccine sorry forgot links to pics and have no idea how to include them on the coverin the feed 1 2 Contextbackground I got an itchy spot 2 days ago monday thought it was a new eczema patch had eczema my entire life. But Tuesday morning it was raised and more of a bump thought maybe a mosquito bite. Got itchier and redder throughout the day and by Tuesday night it was 5 small pus filled blisters that itched worse than eczema. I put a bandaid on it as a few of them popped yellow fluid and crusted. Peeled back the bandaid today wednesday to find what is pictured patch is about twice as big as it was Tuesday night 31 yo woman only the patch is itchy and maybe 14 inch around it. no patches anywhere else no other noticeable symptoms. right shoulder almost at the topcrest not further in where my tank top sits or rubs have not used any high heat products like curling irons no cuts besides the small one above the patch from scratching with a broken nail Again I do have eczema that has been the worst it is been in about 10 years. I thought maybe dyshidrotic eczema because it is more raised then the typical patches I get but it looks a little different and this is not in any creases or typical spots you see DE I have Hashimoto's and am immunocompromised I am gluten sensitive so I thought possibly dermatitis herpetiformis but it looks different and I do not have a celiac disease diagnosis I have not started new meds used new products or changed my diet I have not been anywhere new or around anyone period in about 3 weeks. I WFH and get my groceries delivered I have an elderly cat he is up to date on all vaccines and does not appear to have any symptoms or irregularities to make me think it is any kind of pest problem or anything I do not think it is contact dermatitis I have lived in this house for 3 years and I have been inside lately so do not think it is any kind of allergy to products or the sun or environmental I am HSV1 positive not oral or genital but herpetic whitlow on my index finger right hand. I am currently in the prodrome phase of an outbreak and I am wondering if that is in any way related. This rash popped up 2 days ago monday and I started getting the tingle today wednesday I am incredibly stressed as my boyfriend dumped me a couple months ago for the girl he cheated on me with I am trying to move out as I cannot afford this house alone and I just quit my job and my new one was supposed to start in a couple weeks but now does not start until mid october so money is tight. I am a hot mess I am really going through it I am wondering if it is all stress related but I have never had anything like this. It does not look like stress hives pustules not welts and it is been a couple months would not I develop stress hives sooner? I Do Not Know. Any help is much appreciated as I literally cannot afford out of pocket cost for a clinic not covered by my plan or the ER and my doctor has not returned any of my calls since Monday and is booked out 3 months. And again my clinic that is covered by my crappy insurance does not do labs or Rx and just left me with looks like shingles go to the ER have a good day. I am trying to figure out how to handle this without breaking the bank but with how quickly it is spreading and the itch plus my prodromeherpes ob it is looking more and more like I am going to have to go to the ER. Again any help is much appreciated. Thank you
15434,Please help me figure out if what is been going on is actually a b12 deficiency. My husband is dx with MS so these symptoms are triggering to me. My current symptoms are extreme nerve tingling and some itching that moves around to different parts of my body constantly. Tingling can be anywhere my tongue my legs back where I am laying down scalp behind eyes even my teeth will feel cold and weird. Its not painful but strange enough to make me feel constantly worried when its happening. Feet and fingers constantly cold. Anxiety is very high and I feel so on edge. Dry mouth comes and goes. Some days I hardly feel tingling symptoms and others its happening all day. I have tried to find a pattern but there is none. For MTHFR mutation I have C677T heterozygous A1298C homozygous negative. Slow COMT. Backstory I started taking once a week 1000mg methylcobalamin injections as recommended by a doctor. I am also on the lowest dose of Tirzepatide and most on this medicine take weekly b12 I have had zero side effects of the Tirzepatide except maybe some nausea at times. I do know that Tirzepatide can deplete b12. I started that in March started b12 injections in August but was not very consistent with it. On November 10 after a stressful night the night before I woke up feeling almost like I had shingles on the back of my head. This turned into a full flush of a panic attack and the nerve tingles and hot and cold started all over my body. We honestly thought I was having a stroke and my husband took me to the ER. We believe I took an injection the day before or that morning but truly cannot remember. I was not taking folate at the time. I have tested positive for EBV before as well. I panicked that I was over methylated and stopped b12 injections. I am now taking the supplement Enlyte which has 50mcg of adenosylcobalamin and folate too. Any help or advice is appreciated. I have been through a lot with my health with Hashimotos my labs that I got a few weeks ago look the best they have in 10 years so we do not believe these symptoms are related and very severe endometriosis. My husband also got diagnosed with MS last year so this has been triggering to me. I do not know if I should be patient and wait it out with the Enlyte or try more b12. The MTHFR group warned me of overmethylatjng. I am getting a b12 serum test this week. I got the below labs in December BEFORE I started the Enlyte Folate 29.3 Normal value 4.6 ngmL Vitamin D 63 Normal range 25 80 ngmL Iron 113 Normal range 37 145 mcgdL I have noticed the tingling has happened more since starting Enlyte which they said could happen Thank you. And again please be kind
15437,Anyone used antiviralsacyclovir while suffering with LC?: His is in his armpit chest area. It started yesterday with localised allodynia and sensitivity in that area then this morning a small round rash appeared. We initially thought Lyme but on second though it is more characteristic shingles and fits in with his general symptoms. He has not reported any issues in that area before mostly his aches and pains are in his knees and feet but then he has had shingles on his rib there before so maybe it is a reactivation of that nerve.
15440,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I DID NOT get chicken pox as a young child. My parents split remarried and I have two siblings eleven years younger than me. They both got it the same year at four. I was fifteen. I had so many that I put a small black dot with a marker beside them. I started counting at my neck and lost count over 400 on my neck and face alone. My mom wanted to take a picture I would not let her. I told her I did not want to remember it. My sibs were sick around five days. Not great but not awful. I was incredibly sick and in total pain for 17 days. I almost failed tenth grade. The point? Young children handle it far better than even teenagers. The parents knew this and tried to do what they could pre vaccine It ABSOLUTELY made sense.
15442,Was it your first or second shingles shot MJ? Shots do not bother me but those two shots stung like MFers
15443,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: And that I Am not able to be vaccinated for that until I Am 50 which is INSANE. I would double check on that guidelines have changed. Also they may have said that your insurance will not pay for it if you are under 50 but you can appeal for waivers or pay out of pocket. Look for lowcost programs in your state or contact pharmaceutical companies directly Their websites often have coupon codes for discounts. It is in the insurance companies best interest to pay for a vaccine preventing illness is always cheaper for them than treating an illness. Finally ask you doctor about always having antiviral medications like valacyclovir generic Valtrex cheap on hand for when it flares up again a maintenance prescription. You do not want to lose treatment time waiting for an appointment or an out of stock pharmacy. Finally youselpmonkey keep reminding your mother that shingles is a lifetime problem that it is extremely painful leads to nerve damage that some people never heal from and CONTAGIOUS. You could spread the chickenpox to someone else. She is apologetic but I she has no idea how much pain I am in. I say do not pull your punches. Tell her everyday every hour about your pain. Let her see you suffering and do not hesitate to tell her that this is all her fault. I am pissed off on your behalf
15450,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Born in 84 and got it 3 years ago. Never had a migraine before then and have not had one since but oh boy did I when those shingles hit. I was fortunate not to itch much at all. Minute clinic at the time was happy to see a virus that was not COVID that was little solace.
15451,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I am definitely taking it slow right now and focusing on feeling better I have had a little fatigue so far but I think my stircrazy anxiety for the first few days was masking it. I am so used to constantly moving and going somewhere due to school and work but I am adjusting to the slower pace now Thank you for the kind words and support
15453,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got them in kindergarten and passed them on to my dad. He ended up with blood clots and nearly lost a leg from it. 30 years later he still has problems with that leg.
15455,"Shingles Vaccine: I got the shingles, pneumococcal, and Tdap all on the same day. Felt like hell for a few days, like I do anytime I get a vaccine. Nothing out of the ordinary. But I'm really really hoping this means I'll never get shingles again because I've had it twice in my life and ow doesn't begin to cover it. Like having a rash of wasp stings."
15457,Shingles Vaccine: Some shingles vaccines are live vaccines which can because issues with giving them at the same time as other vaccines. Shingrix specifically has been studied to be given concomitantly with other adult vaccines such as the COVID19 vaccine. If you are someone who usually gets knocked down by vaccines I would suggest staggering any of them. Before I started Kesimpta I got a vaccine for flu covid and pneumonia all the same day but I Am usually completely unphased by flu vaccines and my first covid vaccine was not the same type as my booster and I did not have too much trouble with it. Pneumonia however that shit burned. My side effects were not bad overall low grade fever and fatigue but my arm HURT after vaccine I Am lucky in that I never had chicken pox and was vaccinated against it so I do not have to get the shingles vaccine until at least 65 if at all.
15465,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: 100 yes My 251 was given his shots on schedule. I take the advice from drs and neonatologists who are far more knowledgeable about micro preemies than I am. Hes 6 and we have had every vaccine under the sun he is eligible for including flu shots. Hes rarely sick. Its easy to let the misinformation about these vaccines get in your head but the truth is if they are exposed these little ones cannot fight it
15466,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Typo surely for 2.5 weeks. That said everything we all think we know about shingles did not happen to my gran. It started above her eye surrounded her entire torso lasted for two years went away briefly and then she had it till she died not just neuralgia but open sores. I guess anything is possible if she had shingles for 10
15472,Three weeks ago I found out I have shingles at 35. The doctor said its probably because I am under an intense amount of stress. I suppose I am with planning a wedding job stressors and having the flu just one week prior. I have the blister rash on the side of my back and on my chest. The rash thankfully is going away but I am still left with jolting pain especially on my chest. I have not been sleeping and I am wondering how much longer it will be until I am done with this shingles episode. Anyone here get the shingles shot after they had shingles?
15474,Vaccines and RFKjr: I contracted Shingles at 35 before the Shingrix vaccine was available. I was fortunate to have a fairly mild case but I have heard many anecdotal reports of younger people having Shingles outbreaks. You may want to consider getting it earlier than the recommended age. Be aware it is a two dose series the second shot was rough going for me for a few days.
15477,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Looks like shingles to me but I do not see it often in peds. FWIW.
15484,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 83. I caught it the usual way as did my younger brother and sister. My sister ended up in the emergency room with it. Other kids who shared her symptoms did not survive. I am eternally thankful there is a vaccine now.
15489,Shingles vaccine experience: I got it. I cannot remember anything remarkable about it. Maybe my arm was sore or I could be thinking of the flu shot. I had them both the same time. You do not want shingles. My friend was hospitalized it got so bad for them.
15490,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: This is why medical professionals make you wait 15 minutes after getting a vaccine not just covid to make sure there are no major reactions to getting the shot. Yes some people get achy and stuff over the next day or two but not WEEKS later.
15491,So a little back story I am 44f and I have had health issues my whole life. Asthma being the biggest one. It never stopped me and I think I genuinely had a pretty good life up until about 21. At 21 I had my beautiful son. He is the light of my life and I love him with every fiber of my being. His dad however is a lying cheating stealing arse who left when my son was 1. he is not really a part of the story only to say it is just been us for 22 years. When I was pregnant my lungs did not like it and there is where the downward spiral started. I was put on a massive dose of steroids and 22 years later I am still on them. It started a domino effect. My weight shot up I was a uk size 6 all my life very fit and very active.. even when pregnant from about 9st to over 22st. I was in and out of hospital every year with lung infections. I started getting more serious side effects from all the meds. The next 16 years just kept going down hill. I could not work and no matter how hard I tried the weight would not shift. I was at the gym and swimming 5 days a week. My diet was controlled with the help of an NHS program. It was brutal and so disheartening. I am going to skip 1 relationship details as he was horrible. Lasted 2 years but it killed my mental health even more. Fast forward to January 2020.. my 40th.. I am sick and stuck in my room.. looking back I think it was covid. I then went into full shielding. I was in my room 247. My son was only allowed in to give me food. I was there for about 16 months. 1st day I was allowed outside and my nephew wanted to show me his bike. It was a glorious bank holiday. I went back into the house have walking sticks and my ankle broke right under me. 3 broken bones and dislocated that is another year in bed basically in my living room now. I am missing out loads but you get the gist Then they say I have type 2 diabetes. Managed all these years to avoid it. I get my 1st lot of shingles 6 times in a total of a few years lol A month later what I thought was an asthma attack turns out to be heart failure. Yay more meds 2 months later a really bad stomach infection turns out to be pneumonia and sepsis Oh and a week later add shingles number 2 In between all this my skin is going crazy eczema and my allergies think I must be bored so I am reacting to everything including new medication Fast forward to now. I have just been told I cannot get bariatric surgery as my lungs and heart will not be able to cope. that is was my last line of defense as everything else is so broken. Average of 90 tablets a day in so much pain that they need to take the metal work back out my ankle. Issues with nerve damage. I have genuinely had enough. Before all the big stuff I lost my best friend my mum. She was always there for my health stuff and knew how bad it was I am happy and chatty on the outside and I will still go above and beyond for my family and friends but.. I am done. I missed out on my kid growing up coz I was so sick. I missed out on meeting someone as I do not leave the house and nobody wants a big fat lassie I do not want to be someone is fetish Sorry for the length. Thank you if you made it this far. TLDR My health has been shit for 22 years and after more bad news I have just given up.
15492,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: Certainly you do you but FYI if you get it in your face you can sustain permanent nerve damage in your eyes. I got it there during a period of unusual stress before I was 50. You never know I always said that I had a robust immune system too
15493,Shingles vaccine experience: I know a guy who got Shingles  he got Bells palsy and his face was paralyzed for months. Lots of money and treatment later you can still see the asymmetry. That freaked me the hell out and I got both shots.
15494,Shingles vaccine: I had the same side effects from both shots but I figured it was a lot better than getting shingles.
15495,I used to get a flu shot every year I will never get one again because I think they will try to combine it with COVID vaccine technology The last vaccination I received was for shingles it was awful. Right now I see no way I will ever get another vaccine.
15497,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Shout out to mom I think mine progressed to the point it did since I was initially misdiagnosed when I went to urgent care coincidentally had a scratch on my eye so that was blamed first then assumed to have bad pink eye when I went back since it was worse but when I finally got to the ophthalmologist they said nope eye shingles Eventually I got fancy steroid eye drops and antivirals but things were rough for a while after. Glad things worked out for you
15500,Hello my fellow shingies. Has anyone else had the experience of recurring shingles? I have them again second time this year. Thankfully the rash is minimal but the virus leaves me feeling horrible exhaustion fever. I have tried different antivirals and they make me feel crazy so I usually have to ride it out. I saw a different primary care doctor this time and he said it is not normal for someone to get shingles this often and I should see a specialist if I get them again. AGAIN? I am sick of being sick and I was hoping maybe some of you could share your experience if you have had it. Thank you
15504,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Yeah my lower back hurts too. I was given a topical lidocaine but it only helped a little. None of the pain meds I was prescribed worked etoricoxib paracetamol celecoxib ibuprofen and tramadol. Its almost 3am here and I cannot sleep because of the pain.
15508,Shingles vaccine: If I would have known about it I would have got it. I got shingles a week before my 25th birthday and even though it was caught very early my god that shit was painful
15513,I got shingles on my mons pubisI guess its rare?: Shingles can most certainly occur in the groingenitals. My friend had it on his back and groin.
15514,TIFU by Unintentionally Taking Truck Stop Heroin' to Avoid a Trip to the ER.: Thanks so much for your care and taking the time to respond and give advice They said they ruled out GuillaneBarre but referred me to a neurologist. They put peripheral neuropathy in my discharge notes which totally fits especially with my history of shingles. I cannot live like this 1010 pain on Percocet? In what world? And who knows how long it will take to actually get to see the Neuro...I cannot even hug my daughter properly because even the slightest touch feels like fire this fucking sucks.
15515,How Effective is the RSV antibodies shot they give newborns?: They are also looking into whether the vaccine reduces rates of asthma. Avoiding RSV during the first year of life decreases the risk of asthma by 26 and I think its a fair assumption that the likelihood is connected to the severity of illness. My 10 month old got the vaccine in late October and caught RSV from my 4 year old around Christmas. She was way less sick than my 4 year old. RSV is terrifying watching your child with a very high temperature gasping for breath is terrifying. I Am so grateful my baby received the vaccine.
15517,I was diagnosed with shingles on Sunday. My first lesion appeared on my forehead on Friday. I thought it was a weird cluster of pimples but Saturday my glands below my jaw were swollen the spot was oddly swollen and itchy and I suspected this was not just a weird pimple. After face washing Sat evening it was very itchy and I rubbed it a bit too roughly with a towel which opened up all the blisters. At that point I knew I needed to see a doctor. I grew several more lesions after seeing a doctor Sunday morning and being shocked this was shingles. Pain really set in Monday. Today is Wed and I think I have turned a corner towards feeling better. The lesions are more itchy than painful today and they are not as swollen. My eyelid is crazy swollen I Am hopeful that goes down soon too. I did see an eye doc on Monday eye itself is fine. Anyway I Am looking for tips on healing these yucky shot gun spots I have on that initial lesion where I ripped open all the blisters. Any advice? Its so prominent and I do not want scarring. Any advice welcome
15518,Shingles vaccine: I Have had shingles and I Have had the vaccine. GET THE VACCINE.
15524,Are there any ways to get prescribed things like PrEP or discuss options for vaccines like HPV monkeypox without going to a local health clinic?: I got my PrEP prescription from Freddie back when I did not have a GP. Definitely the best place to go if you are looking to avoid a face to face interaction. If you are ever in DT Toronto check out HQ Clinic. I just got my second mpox vaccine from there about 20 minutes ago. Their express STI testing also makes the trimonthly testing for prep quick and easy.
15527,Shingles vaccine: Got my first dose in September. A little tired maybe but no big deal. just got my flucovid two weeks back and nothing either so ? Watch the second shingles will floor me now.
15530,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: Hey no joke  get the shingles vaccination. Luckily I did. I had an outbreak and though it did not wholly prevent it was VERY mild.
15533,"Almost 2 months into shingles outbreak on my face -- how long did it take for raised edges of blisters to flatten?: Hi everyone. My shingles rash started Feb 10; I thought it was contact dermatitis at first so I didn't get the anti-viral in time for to be effective. My shingles wasn't that bad -- small pattern, and while few spots that have shrunk the worst of the areas are raised enough that if I cover with makeup, you can see it. The dark areas are fading thankfully but I can still feel the bumps from it on my face with my fingers. How long did it take for yours to flatten completely? Thank you!"
15534,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yeah I am already worried about that. I had shingles at 38 but a super mild case. I had no idea I had anything more than an uncomfortable rash I almost forgot about until my 9 month old daughter hot chicken pox out of nowhere. Zero exposure to anyone with that shit. Then it hit me... and yeah. Mine was nothing. Her chicken pox was BRUTAL. Her diaper area looked like ground beef. Her scalp face back and chest were all covered. She was so little and so sick. It was awful. I will be turning 50 in February. That shot is on the list.
15538,Shingles vaccine: The second shot made me a little weak a tired feeling for the afternoon but was gone the next day. DO NOT skip this vaccine. 2 family members had shingles and even my stoic brother was weeping like a child for weeks upon weeks.
15542,Shingles vaccine: Mine was only on the left side of my face. It looked like the most godawful fever blister combined with being hit in the face with a club. A couple lesions were more on the cheek and closer to the nose. I could feel the nerve that exits the skull below the eye and travels down the face. Also the top of my head on the left side hurt. The lip and left face swelling was so bad that the middle part of the upper lip was pushed over to below my right nostril. After 5 or so days of meds the swelling was down enough that I simply looked like a meth addict.
15543,Shingles vaccine: It sucked so badly I never went back for the booster. I had shingles when I was 30.
15547,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same for me. I got shingles at 25 in my left eye. It was the worst pain I Have been through.
15548,The manufacturers GSK and Pfizer manufacturing Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines respectively must now include a warning stating a risk of GuillainBarre syndrome GBS following vaccination according to a January 7 statement from the agency.: I know someone who got GBS after a vaccine also but it was never admitted. Instead it was treated as some kind of medical mystery
15549,when did you realize you were old...: I got Shingles a couple years ago and it was mild for me. But the minute I saw the rash I headed to the doctor and was on an antiviral right away. I did not have any symptoms except for the rash and that was only bothersome for about a week if I accidentally scratched it. I am not sure if I just got lucky or it was the speed at which I started the meds.
15552,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: NAD but yes you can take valacyclovir. When i had shingles last year that is what they prescribed me. Weirdly enough it popped up on my boyfriend in the same area as mine about a month ago. Though ours was around the eye unfortunately I did not realize it could damage eyesight. But yeah if you can take that it is one of the things they prescribe for it. I think mine was prescribed 3x a day. Not sure if it will help get rid of itdry it out fastersomeone lost mine after the 2nd day and it was prescribed for 10 days but hopefully it will help
15555,Don39t Be Angry NY Times and Vaccine Harm: Me too i went salvation army shopping immeduately after getting it suddenly both legs stopped working could not walk continues to this day must hold onto cane or cart and have excrutuating pain all day no exercise takes it away. Only got it because doc kept telling me I needed it. No shots after that one in 2015.
15558,I Am with youno reaction to the ones you mentioned. And as a 1yrold my smallpox vaccination did not takeminimal reaction to a second try and no scarring. But the first shingles shot definitely got my attention and the 2nd one yeah expect an 18wheeler.
15559,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles 2x in my 30s and a suspected case when I was 49. Got the vaccine on my 50th birthday. My siblings also got shingles in their 30s.
15567,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: That Is what I Am hoping for. I usually bounce back quick from other shots
15568,Eye and face shingles oy vey: Damn so sorry you guys are now part of this awful club. The pain is absolutely no joke and I have a high pain tolerance. I cannot imagine how bad it hurts on the face. A few things that helped me were getting on both oral and topical antivirals as well as a topical lidocaine. I stayed on anti inflammatories used ice andor cold rags as needed. I have heard people that get pain medication that say its helps but I personally did not. Also tons of rest and tons of water. I Am a couple weeks since I had active blistering and the insane neck pain is still absolutely crippling. Hope he gets relief soon. I know I was exhausted cuz I could not sleep.
15569,41 and got Shingles: Yes both myself and my husband have had it in the last couple years. We are 4042. Both have autoimmune stuff going on.
15572,Acyclovir only 2x a day: I Am currently recovering from shingles in the Philippines also. The doctor I saw here at a private clinic put me on 800mg 5 times a day. From everything I Have read online that seems to be the recommended dose. I started the pills on day 2 of the rash appearing it continued to spread for a few days but in a different way. I got some fluid filled blisters on my back where it started but as it spread to my chest and down my upper arm I did not get any more blisters. I Am now just over 3 weeks since the rash started it has basically completely healed but I Am still dealing with the nerve symptoms mostly burning tingling numbness and itching where the rash was.
15573,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: K bit seriously please PLEASE talk to your parents about the shingles vaccine. I got shingles in my late 20s. Long story short but I went multiple times to the Drs and they did not do a physical so missed me having shingles. Which meant I did not get antivirals within the 2 week period needed and am literly disabled from the nerve damage. I went from super active weight lifter back country hiker to spending 9 months of ever year in bed. I am legally disabled and will probably never not be on PWD bc of the extent of my nerve damage. Shingles destroyed my life. Please please talk to those of 50 and beg them to get the vaccine.
15579,Deerslippers you do not want to get shingles. My mother appears to never to have been infected with chicken pox yet she is had shingles five times in the last 15 years. She is first on the doorstep for her vaccine. Ian can tell you how debilitating it is.
15582,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: My shingles face eardrums throat anniversary just passed on Thanksgiving. I get occasional brain shocks my right face is still numb to the touch but I can move it and my tongue and right eardrum permanently hurt. Consider upping the gabapentin dosages if the docs approve of it... and just figure some pain management in the meantime. Get her on valacyclovar or whatever to rid the virus AS SOON AS POSSIBLE before it exacerbates the damage.
15586,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: I have had both shots and only slight localized pain. Everyone I know who has had shingles has wished for death at least once during a flare up. It can also present in the eye area causing blindness.
15592,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles in my eye and the whole top left side of my head. Developed postherpetic neuralgia. Shingles was painful but the neuralgia made me go insane. The pain subsided and I got my vision back in about 10 days. A couple days later my eye slammed shut swelled up uveitis and I got the most insane uncontrollable itching in my eye and all of my skin that was infected including in my scalp. I got hyper sensitive to light and was essentially blinded for 6 months. I made it three days before calling my doctor again and he prescribed me Gabapentin. What a life Saver. I was literally scratching the skin off of my face wanted to gouge my eye out and I would only be able to sleep out of pure exhaustion after screaming for awhile. I would get maybe 23 hours of shitty sleep a day. Gabapentin calmed the nerves enough for me to sleep and somewhat enjoy my day. Only way I could use a phonepc was laying on my stomach with the brightness all the way down and squinting with my good eye. I did not leave the house for anything but eye doctors appointments for 34 months could not drive for about 6 months. It is been 4 years at this point. I have my vision fully back but whenever I step outside my left eye involuntarily closes and slowly opens as it adjusts to the sunlight and is much more sensitive to windheatersac blowing.
15594,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Ocular shingles was the worst pain I have ever experienced
15596,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah Mum has told me she took me to a couple but I never managed to catch it Few years later the vaccine came out and to her credit she took me straight to the doc and got me it.
15599,Shingles vaccine: I had zero side effects from the shingles vaccine
15601,Shingles vaccine experience: I have had very bad nerve pains for almost 30 years now. None of the meds I have taken seem to really work. Anyways my arms and my side were itching like crazy. I let it go on for a couple of weeks until I could not take it anymore. My skin was very red and sore from scratching so much. I showed my doctor and she said that it was shingles. She asked me if I felt the pain. I have been so used to it for so long that I really did not feel it. Well I did feel pain but I did not know the difference. She ordered the shot so I got it a couple of days later along with Calamine lotion the itchiness went away.
15604,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Just got my second Shin gri x shot 2 months ago. No side effects except for a slightly sore arm for 2 days.
15612,Hi friends. I have hEDS hypermobile EhlersDanlos Syndrome and a few vascular compressions but the most debilitating one currently is my SMAS or Superior Messentric Artery Syndrome. For a couple years now various GIs and I have suspected I have gastroparesis but tests would come back normal including GES. I joined this sub and have gotten so much help with nausea and figuring out high calorie drinks when I am really struggling to eat. You guys rock This past May I had MALS surgery Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome and right after it the pain med I was in caused swallowing issues so I lost a ton of weight and my SMAS reared it is ugly head. I got a GJ feeding tube this past September and everything was finally going smoothly and I was getting nutrition and gaining weight back. On November 16 I got my first Shingles vaccine per my rheumatologist since I am on Humira. The next day I vomited as soon as I woke up and every time I ran my tube feeds through my J tube 75 ml hr over 16 hrs Compleat Standard 1.4 I would wake up with abdominal pain and vomiting yellow bile that looked like it had some formula in it as well. I used to be able to take a little nutrition orally as well but anything beyond water and broth by mouth was making me vomit. Now the last 3 weeks I have been completely unable to run tube feeds at all. I make it barely 4 hrs at 20 ml he and then the abdominal pain is excruciating. I have stopped vomiting but the pain got so bad the other day I could not stop screaming and my husband had to call an ambulance. The ER got me morphine and Bentyl and got my pain back down but I am honestly scared of my pump and feeds at this point. I had been trying to run my feeds very slowly again when the pain got so bad. I was in the hospital all last week and they thought I was just constipated. They did a full clean out and I managed to get 12 hrs of feeds run at 20 ml hr without issue so they discharged me. The next day after discharge is when I took the ambulance ride after my feeds running for 48 hrs at 3035 ml hr. When I was in the hospital last week a CT showed some oral contrast still in my colon from 8 DAYS PRIOR when the ER had checked my feeding tube placement. The GI team did not seem to think this was important but I think it is a sign that my motility has just stopped. My neuroGI is stumped and I see her tomorrow to try and figure this out without another hospital stay. Reglan is helping a little bit it makes me so irritable and restless and I loathe it. Bentyl and my TENS unit cranked up on my abdomen every moment I am awake are also helping a little but I have not managed really more than a couple hundred cal a day for 3 weeks now. I lost 10 lbs last week alone. I am going to ask my GI about gastroparesis but can it impact the intestines too? When I run feeds or eat drink it feels like my GI system just stops. There is no sounds or gurgling at all and once I get morphine or writhe in pain for hours eventually my intestines get a couple big gurgles and the pain starts to subside. I know untreated SMAS can because other GI issues but could it because GP? My GI seems stumped and the hospital definitely was stumped as well. I had 4 normal CTs and 2 normal x rays as well as normal blood work in the last 2 weeks alone. I am on 2.5 mg Oxycodone twice a day but I am also on 25 mg Movantik daily stool softeners and Senna and enemas as needed. I am having daily BMs and have been having them mostly this whole time just a day or two here and there without a BM. I cannot use osmotic laxatives they just stretch out my intestines and because pain so I have to use stimulants. I also cannot use Motegrity because of the black box warning and past suicidal ideation and plans made while on other meds with the same warning.
15616,Shingles vaccine: I have had 3 shingles vaccine shots. The original several years ago and the 2shot one last year. My brother got shingles and really was miserable for 2 weeks. I do not remember any bad effects although I may have had a minor sore arm. It is worth it.
15617,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Oh I Am so sorry I had it a couple of years ago and it sucked so badly I remember being so tired all the time. I hope you feel better soon
15621,F RSV: We are a family of 4 one 5 week old and one 2.5 yo and we all ended up with RSV when my daughter brought it home from daycare. Luckily my wife got the RSV vaccine when she was in the third trimester. My daughter and I got it the worse. We both still have a phlegmy cough and congestion while my wife and infant had a very mild case hopefully it stays that way. My wife insisted on getting that new RSV vaccine and so far it was definitely worth it
15622,Shingles and other Vaccines: After having shingles on my scalp face and in my eye on the cornea I encourage everyone to get the vaccine. I now have nerve damage from the shingles burning the myelin off the nerves and it can feel like a hot iron stuck to my face. It was a living hell that had me in the hospital for eight days.
15625,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: I am so thankful you posted this. I had to take a medical sabbatical July 31 2022 for recurrent shingles. I Have had 31 recurrences and I Have seen so many doctors. My school district said I could come back after the shingles vaccine. My infectious disease doctor neurologist general practitioner etc say getting the vaccine will because more shingles and of course valcyclovir but me into kidney failure when I have tried to take it. I am completely at a loss as to all the symptoms that have all developed. I cannot remember things I stumble finding the right words in conversations I pivot between insomnia and sleep. The scars I have on my face and body and the post herpetic nerve pain is THE WORST. The infectious disease doctor wants to hospitalize me with my next bout. I just want it all to stop.
15626,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I am procrastinating because of possibly being sick for a few days after. I got to get over it because I had a small outbreak of shingles once. That teeny tiny patch of shingles on my torso was crazy painful.
15627,"Flu-like symptoms after Johnson & Johnson shot: Following my first dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, I developed intense flu-like symptoms that lasted for several days. Despite recovering, I decided to proceed with the second shot. However, a week after the second dose, the same symptoms resurfaced, leaving me feeling drained and uncertain about the efficacy of the vaccine for me. I have a history of seasonal allergies and have been using antihistamines regularly. Despite trying to boost my immune system with elderberry supplements and garlic, it seems I couldn't avoid this setback. Has anyone encountered a similar reaction post-vaccination? ---"
15628,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Shingles fucking sucks. I had it at 43 or 42 I cannot remember. It was a mild case the rash area was about the size of a half dollar. It felt like someone was twisting a hot poker into my skin and shooting laser beams through my armpit into my right breast. They gave me codeine for the pain which took it from an 8 to a 7. yay. I just turned 50 and as soon as I am all clear from covid I am getting my shingles vaccine and covid and flu
15635,I had the same for the first dose. Nothing at all for the second one. Very glad I followed through because shingles is miserable. Worse than the shot by far.
15637,First time shingles and scared: So sorry you are now a member of the Shingles Club. It sucks not going to lie but you got on antivirals early so that should halt the progression of the rash and speed the healing. But you may be contending with the itch for weeks. I am on week two after the shingles rash popped up in the middle of my back on the left side after intense itching for about three days. Went on antivirals immediately it did not spread much. Easily manageable during the dayjust a lowburn itch. Nights have been on and off bad though. Get a script for some gabapentin and take 300 mg at night with a couple Tylenol. That worked for me MOST nights. I am out of the gaba now and relying 100 percent on Tylenol which does not quite cut it. Keeps the itch at bay for maybe four hours then I have to pop a couple more in the middle of the night and icepack my back to get back to sleep. But overall the trend is toward healing. Since you got on antivirals so quickly your course should follow a similar path. Good luck hang in there and do not scratch
15641,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If you have had chicken pox the virus is dormant inside of you. It emerges opportunistically generally if you are stressed out or not sleeping well or your immune system is otherwise doing poorly. And it SUCKS. It can show up anywhere along nerve lines or something like that? For me it was the back of my head and was an awful nearconstant stabbing pain that did not even allow me a momentary relief of sleep. I was in my late 30s and it freaked me out I thought maybe I had brain cancer or something. I do not think there is anything you can realistically do to prevent it aside from getting the Shingles vaccine which you cannot get until 50 years old maybe earlier if... reasons? I DO NOT KNOW. Just try to be healthy and keep good sleep habits and keep your stress low I suppose.
15642,"Seeking advice from the community regarding long-term side effects following the Shingrix vaccination. Since receiving my shots in 2020 and then again in June 2023, I've been struggling with chronic ear pain, dizziness, vertigo, and headaches. The symptoms appeared shortly after the most recent dose, and despite ongoing medical investigations, the root cause remains elusive. Specialists suspect the issues lie within my inner ear, but concrete answers have been hard to come by. I've been undergoing various tests like MRI's and CT scans, but so far, nothing conclusive has been found. This prolonged battle with side effects has taken a toll on my daily life, and I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has encountered similar challenges or has any insights to share. Any input or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated."
15645,Trying to determine because: FYI I got shingles at 21 and 30 years old and I was also vaccinated. It for sure happens.
15646,Shingles and PHN Experience: Interesting about the TENS unit. My husband bought one for his shoulder pain about six months ago. Where do you place the pads directly on the area of pain or . ? I was just diagnosed today after a misdiagnosis of an upper UTI five days ago after two days suffering with a throbbing kidney pain of the kind the commenter below describes. Rash on left side of middle backand accompanying fiery painonly developed two days ago. Lymph nodes in left armpit swollen and painful. Saw my primary care doc today and am now on Valtrex and Gabapentin. Hoping for first nights sleep in five days but extremely worried about long lasting pain. Sixty year old healthy as a horse female who never gave shingles a thought. Docs push COVID and flu vaccine every time they see me but never once mentioned the shingles vaccine
15647,My best friend got vaccinated because she is a kidney transplant recipient and felt she needed to do what she could to stay as healthy as possible. Since then her 10yr transplanted kidney has failed and she got shingles 2 months ago AND had a stroke 3 weeks ago. She cannot
15649,This is FICTION not fact: My grandfather almost went blind in one or both eyes i do not know because of shingles. When its time I Am getting that vaccine.
15656,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Just mentioning for those who never got Chickenpox as a kid its possible to have CP and not get the sores. This was me. Two friends got the sores and general pox symptoms. I only got the other symptoms. My mother was a RIGHT NOW and always insisted I probably had it. Got tested in my 40s to confirm I was in fact positive for antibodies.
15661,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it in my 30s on my torso. It was a relatively mild case but it hurt. I have gotten both the shingles shots.
15663,Shingles vaccine question: I got both of mine on Friday afternoons and laid low on the Saturdays but then was fine. I was not even that bad on the Saturdays.
15668,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: No but I STILL got shingles 2 years after having both doses. Fortunately it was a fairly mild case and I figured it out early enough to get on antivirals but still do not recommend.
15670,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles 6 weeks after giving birth. It was terrible. Literally felt like my spine was rubbing bone on bone. And have a substancial scar from the outbreak point.
15674,Shingles on face: My symptoms started with a really bad headache ear pain and a just was not feeling good. I went to the ER 3 times before they got it right and by then half my face was paralyzed
15675,: Got a totally fit friend tri athelete who out of nowhere had a heart attack. His WIDOW MAKER was 100 clogged. Doctor could not believe he was alive. vaccine through and through. There is no point telling him or any other vaccine about this. cryingface
15678,I got the shingles vaccine and soooo thankful I did I have seen wayyyy too many bad things happen to people who did not. Ps I had ZERO vaccine reactions other than a sore arm for a day or 2
15684,This vaccine may help protect against dementia and its already available Further research is needed and GSK is actively investigating to generate additional evidence to understand the possible association between shingles vaccination and dementia.: I am looking forward to gettting it to avoid shingles. that alone makes it worth a sore arm for few days. i know someone who got shingles and despite prompt treatment day after it appeared was given an antiviral pain medicine it still hurt. then pain med was os nauseating it got worse than the pain so she went without that in order to be able to make herself eat. sore arm maybe body aches and a fever from the shot or weeks of pain possibly permanent nerve pain from the shingles. yeah give me the shot one thing to look forward to about getting older. wish they let younger folks get it since shingles is popping up more in under 50s too
15688,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles brought on by stress about six years ago. On my face of all places. Two weeks flat on my back unable to eat and in horrific pain. I would say it served grandma right.
15689,I have no memory of anything but a slightly sore arm for a day. Ditto with everyone I know who has had the Shingrix shots. Ignore her fear mongering. Someone will get shingles because of her comments.
15690,"Which DMT to get for 3 months supply but can split it into 6 months?: I will try to keep this short for reading: -I take Avonex(1box per month 4 injections), no problem. -I need to live outside the country for 6 months. -insurance only prescribes maximum of 3 months supply of medicine at a time. Inside the country only. -thinking of taking something stronger than Avonex then cut the dosage to 0.5 to last me 6 months. -there is already a DMT that I can take every 6 months but unfortunately I feel like my dr wont agree as my MS is mild. Any advice guys?"
15693,Don39t Be Angry NY Times and Vaccine Harm: I have a friend who just got the latest boost..refuses to hear. Is sure it was from the bug. Coukd not possibly be that she was fooled and still is. Serious heart rhythms disturbances followed the last. A couple surgeries later she felt better a few friends died. Then she takes it again. We will see how she does. I apologize about any misspellings babel bot is hard at work scrambling communication
15694,Lyme Disease in Ottawa: It is normal to have lethargy soreness poor appetite after some vaccines. Just like the covid vaccine. Usually the second one is not so bad but your vet might be willing to give your pup an anti inflammatory during the next visit too. Also you can delay giving the oral preventative for a few days after the vaccine. It could either one that gave it a hard time.
15697,"Soreness after tetanus shot: I got my tetanus shot a couple of days ago and my arm has been really sore ever since. It's making it hard to sleep at night because every time I move, it hurts. Is this normal or should I be concerned?"
15698,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: skull that is hilarious but also even if you are under 50 even in your 30s ask about getting it. My friend had it last year at 34 all over her entire body and she said the pain was out of this world way worse than childbirth for her. And she is had 2 totally unmedicated births.
15701,Father w major attack. Two coworkers of 10 w seizures. Teenager friend father friend 70s with singles thr latter having been shingles vaccine New onset celiac Raynauds Sjogrenslike symptoms in our household of 4. Friend w attack. No official covid for any.
15705,Shingles and GenX: Nice analogy I felt like I was being electrocuted in my back and would wake up screaming from the pain. Only interesting part was finding out how first hand how long it is possible to survive without sleep and stay sane still a scientific experiment I could have lived without though
15707,Vaccine Requests: My son got RSV when he was almost 5. He had his vaccine too. It was so scary. I did everything I could not to freak him out about it since he thought it was just a normal cold. But there were times he would cry going to sleep because he kept stopping breathing. Sometimes he would refuse to lay down at all and would fall asleep sitting up out of fear. Thankfully he recovered okay but I cannot imagine having to go through that with a younger baby that cannot even communicate. I am 8 months along right now and while everyone here is vaccinated for it I told my parents who plan to come visit they need to get theirs updated but I am feeling like my mom is going to tell me she did when she is not going to. We were often very late on vacations growing up and would not end up getting a lot until the school sent home notes about it and I am sure she is long overdue for more than a few. We did buy hand sanitizer and lots of soaps but it is always a worry

15710,"""Question about COVID test accuracy during a chickenpox outbreak after receiving the HPV vaccine? [28F]: Age: 28, Sex: Female, Height: 5'5, Weight: 65kgs, Race: Hispanic, Medication: Calamine lotion, Tylenol for fever I recently had a chickenpox outbreak and have been managing the symptoms with prescribed medications. However, I've been feeling under the weather with a persistent cough and headache. I had received the HPV vaccine a few weeks before the outbreak. Would the presence of the chickenpox virus affect the results of a COVID test? Contemplating getting tested soon."""
15711,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: How old do you have to be to have the vaccine? In the uk they only give it to over 65s.
15713,"25[M] diagnosed 14 days after first Johnson & Johnson shot: Sharing my unexpected journey post-vaccine. About two weeks after receiving my first dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, I noticed a strange tingling sensation in my fingers. I didn't think much of it at first, but soon after, small blisters started appearing on my hands. Concerned, I sought medical advice, and it was determined that I had developed a rare dermatological reaction to the vaccine. The blisters were painful and itchy, making it difficult for me to go about my daily activities. I was prescribed a topical cream to help alleviate the discomfort, but the healing process was slow and frustrating. Despite the challenges, I am grateful for the protection the vaccine offers against COVID-19. Has anyone else experienced a skin reaction after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? ---"
15716,Shingles shot reactions?: I had it in my SCALP No vaccine reaction could come close to that agony
15721,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: Beyfortus was just approved in August and it is still in rollout. My baby is 7 months and we just got it last month because it was always out of stock at our pediatrician and we were not priority fullterm infant no health issues higher socioeconomic status etc. I also know it has not been publicized well and there have been parents of very young infants that I have mentioned it to that did not even know that it exists. So we are getting there.
15725,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Mine started at the beginning of October. Still feeling it Not this bad but still doing 800mg of Gabapentin a day. And itching like mad. The photo was 9 days in. No shot. I would suggest getting one sooner than later. A weekend of possible illness is much better than 10 weeks of this crap
15728,First dose: I had just a slight sting that I think was from the alcohol swab. Honestly I did not think I would be able to do this to myself and am quite happy that I can so I will not need someone to stab me with a needle. It was down to a dog or a 4 year old and neither sound promising
15733,Shingles shot reactions?: I definitely rescheduled the second after the first one took me out Made absolutely certain I could sleep it off for 3 days and stocked up on ready to eat meals Does Not come anywhere close to the hell that is shingles Some people catch it immediately and start treatment fast enough that its just a really uncomfortable rash but the window for getting treatment is hours not days.
15734,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Man my parents have recurring shingles. It keeps coming back. Well my dad got the vaccine finally but shingles is wretched. Its awful. I got my kid vaccinated on the regular vaccine schedule. I Am going to be getting that shot as soon as I can.
15739,Paranoid about shingles: 32 here I got shingles on September Luckily it was just my left arm. My only advice is the SECOND you see the patchy localized rash get antivirals. My case only lasted about 9 days though I had some discoloration for about a month. If you can get the shingles vaccine do it. I was not able to because you are young
15743,Its a 2 shot vaccine and it is no joke but I have had Shingles twice and would not wish that on anyone.
15744,Longterm shingles and neurological symptoms: Firstly you have my sympathy. It is the worst thing to deal with. I have had recurrences since my first bout in August 2023. And mine has also been on both sides of my face. You are the only person I have come across who mentions the ear issues. I am getting intermittent pulsingtapping in my eardrum like it is a speaker driver vibrating. I already had tinnitus but this is different. I finish a long course of aciclovir today 5x800mg per day for 2 weeks and then 2x800mg a day for 2 weeks but fully exoect it to come right back. I am in for full blood work tomorrow as GP thinks there must be an underlying reason. I am in poor health. Bowel damaged by endometriosis so I am hoping that is the because and not something more sinister. Sorry I cannot offer you any advice other than as much rest as possible and I take llysine and extra viramin D on top of my usual multivitamins.
15748,: I have been concerned for my health ever since being forced to get the first round... I have had previous heart issues no issues since but... since they are basically ignoring this what can someone like me do? Could i possibly have some of these clots forming? Has it been long enough since the last jab that I am in the clear? I am also concerned for my mom and granddad's health because they keep getting updated jabs everytime they come out. cryingface
15750,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I used to have severe anxiety... severe. A couple strange things would set it off until I had a panic attack and then ultimately faint. Scrolling down spreadsheets and driving on the freeway. Today I have very slight consistent anxiety but nothing like my 20's. I think sipping down endless energy drinks before I understood a goddamn thing about health might have contributed but yeesh fainting is not a great experience especially around others.
15751,RSV vaccine for me pregnant vs monoclonal antibodies for baby? Winter 20242025: There is a small association with getting the rsv vaccine in pregnancy and the baby being born low birth weight or jaundiced. There is also a potential small association with preeclampsia
15755,Starting methotrexate and shingles vaccine: Thanks I was doing alright then right before bed I got the chills and body aches. It seems worse than my first covid shot
15758,First time with shingles is this normal?: I Am in my fifth week of severe pain. I feel like its never going to end. I did not have many blisters that could pop but I Have had some. I Have had a rash on my right side from my spine to my belly button for five weeks and its not getting any better. Every day it feels like its a little worse. I have a stabbing pain about every 10 seconds through most of the day. I take tramadol so I can sleep because that is the only time I do not have pain. I would not wish this one anyone and I Am sorry its happening to you.
15762,Pediatrician not giving vaccines: We had a similar situation except we thought the bloody poop was from a dairy allergy and turns out it was from the rotavirus vaccine he would only get it right after receiving it and lasted a few days. I had no idea this was a thing
15768,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles right after having Covid. My shingles attacked my sciatic nerve. Debilitating leg pain. Shingles also disseminated to both sides and attacked my lungs. 11days in the hospital during Xmas 2022 sucked. In isolation room since shingles can become airborne.
15769,Anyone else's shingles look like this?: They appear to have already blistered and are in scab stage. Maybe 10 days old?
15770,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: She was vaccinated and still got it? Also what a titer?
15780,RSV Shot: I got it last year when my baby was 2 months old. Those were his first vaccinations and also his roughest but there no side effects longer than 12 hours. He was just a little fussier than normal I think he would have been this way regardless of the RSV vaccination. Just a heads up it was a little more expensive than we thought it would be. We did not care because its way better than our baby getting sick but depending on your insurance it may not be fully covered.
15781,Hi everyone I had shingles around my left eye on my eyebrows and on my forehead about two and a half months ago. It has healed nicely and stoped hurting about 1 month after the outbreak. My left eye and my eyebrow have started bothering me again now two and a half months after the start of everything. Its a bit itchy and it gets a bit painful here and there. Its a slightly painful if I touch it. There Is no visible new rashes though just a bit red still. Its not that bad it is bothering my left eye though quite a bit. Just checking if this is normal? Is it just the nerves healing or is it possible to have another outbreak at the same spot? Thank you
15783,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I know too many people actually mostly nurses who are below the vaccination age who have had shingles. Lowering the vaccination age may be called for. My mom had shingles and post shingles neuralgia. Nasty and painful. I hope you heal quickly.
15784,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I received the chickenpox vaccine as toddlerbaby and then never got chicken pox but I still got shingles as a 16 year old when I was starving myself to make weight for wrestling.
15789,Pediatric Herpes Zoster and PHN..: I have not been able to get into a neurologist earliest appt is February but I am going then. But the other poster said his neurologist called it transverse myelitis. I looked it up and sure enough it can be triggered by shingles. Cannot get out of bedoh God I know what you mean. I would be stuck like a turtle on its back. Cannot poop? Yup gastrointestinal hell. And I got stuck in the bathtub for twelve hours because I did not have the strength to get over the side of the tub. I now am a showeronly girl just from the trauma. I wish I could fix us both
15792,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: This year the insurance inexplicitly did not pay for my normal routine mammogram. I failed to get them to pay even though I am pretty sure that I am right that this should be covered like it has been every year. The hospital turned me over to collections. I am paying it out 50 a month. I am so upset with the whole process
15798,Shingles vaccine experience: I got shingles at 42 and it royally sucked. Thankful I did not suffer any of the long term effects I Am reading about here.
15801,It started out as a spider bite and then it turns out I have shingles. I basically have been taking antibiotics for a week. I Am just so worried of what comes next or what does this mean to get shingles at 32. I Have never had chicken pox and was vaccinated when young. Still everything is annoying and I Am literally alone in this as the people around me think I Am being dramatic.
15806,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I still have visible chicken pox scars on my arms torso and neck from over 40 years ago when I had chicken pox as a young child. While they have faded over the years and are pretty small they are definitely still there. I also had shingles hit me a few years back. It was a mild case but still very painful and i was still am too young for the vaccine. My mild case of shingles permanently damaged a small cluster of nerves that causes a feeling of itchy burning sensation in that spot regularly. Why are you trying to downplay the ramifications this poor baby will now be faced with for the rest of her life?
15810,Anyone had the Shingles shot? If so did it make your arm sore? I am about to go in an hour.
15811,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: Some scabs were on my scalp took antivirals Day 1 of the rash and it still spread and caused iritis in my eye was not until I got antivirals in an IV that it started to heal. You All scabbed up way worse than I did but I know exactly what pain you all must have been feeling and its seriously the worst pain. I noticed the PHN flares up under stress.
15812,Shingles vaccine experience: I got shingles when I was 40. It felt like my arm was on fire for a week. And that is with treatment starting as soon as I started breaking out. I suspect that the vaccine will lay you out for a few days but I will take that over burning again. I get the runaround on if I can get it earlier than 50 but if I can pull it off I will get it with no delay.
15813,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I got shingles on my sciatica nerve when I was 25 9 years ago worst week of my life
15816,Shingles Is NO Joke: Oh no hope you all feel better I also got it at 25 so they misdiagnosed me 3 times as a bug bite on my eyebrow... until both of my eyesockets swelled to golf balls... The ER sent me home 2 times in a week saying if it gets worse come back immediately. First visit was when a spot above my eye was incredibly painful and had what looked like a whitehead.... until the layer of skin came off. Sent home. Second visit same eye is entirely swollen shut. Given antiinflammatories and antibiotics. Again told if it gets worse come back. 2 days later both eyes turning black and blue and swollen shut. Go to ER. Given pain relievers and antibiotics. They ATTEMPT to send me home. Luckily my godmother was a head nurse there so we asked her to come look. She was in shock at my face and said she was friends with the head of infectious diseases. She ran him down here and he had it out with the ER staff about how incredibly stupid they are and I could have died. Explained that whatever it was had infected my sinuses and around my eye socket causing periorbital cellulitis. An infection that if enters the vessels behind the eye could because immediate andor possibly lethal brain damage So I was not responding to different antibiotics IV treatments. They had no idea what was going on got diagnosed with SARS. Then rediagnlsed with MRSA and put in isolation. He asked if I had the chicken pox as a kid... and I had thought my whole life that I did not and I definitively could not remember.They just kept the diagnosis of periorbital cellulitis until the last 3 days when he asked the same question while my mom was visiting to learn that I had and was immediately diagnosed with shingles and released 2 days later... after 2 weeks of chaos and guessing. It was a damn wild ride.
15819,"""Nausea and dizziness after flu shot: I got my annual flu shot a few days ago and ever since then, I've been feeling nauseous and dizzy. It's like a constant wave of queasiness. Has anyone else had this reaction to the flu vaccine? I'm not sure if I should be worried or if it's just a normal side effect."""
15823,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: Its great to hear there are good doctors here. I went to two private doctors with my selfdiagnosis of shingles and they both said rashes until it became full blown and I had to go to a hospital for a few days. Most painful experience of my life and I have the scars years later.
15826,41 and got Shingles: I got mine at age 37 and before the rash popped up I had terrible pain beginning from my left spinal area and wrapped around my ribs up to my stomach area. I have Crohn's disease so I thought I was having a terrible flare and off to the ER I went. They did nothing for me. Not even imaging. Just gave me some lidocaine and called it a pulled muscle. I went to my GP who was more suspicious and said to watch the area because she suspected shingles and she was right. She prescribed some antiviral medication and gabapentin which I did not take and I suffered through it for almost 2 weeks. I hope to never have it again.
15839,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Do not remember my age at the time but it was probably between elementary to middle school. My younger sister got chicken pox from school. Then I got it head to toe. No vaccine available at the time. Had to use prescribed medicine and aloe vera to avoid the scarring. Ended up getting shingles on my face in my late 20s. I think stress and exhaustion activated mine. Came close to my right eye. Started as a rash until the third day. Had to go to the hospital to fight the infection l. Suffered some nerve damage right side of my nostril. The doctors did not believe it was shingles. Said I was too young. Got the vaccination later on.
15846,Shingles vaccine: It felt like the flu but worse. Cold chills. Body aching. Massive headaches. I was up taking showers to feel better. It did not work.
15847,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles when I was thirty and I never want to have it again. Worst pain of my life. Get the vaccine but do not get it when you get any other vaccines. I did the vaccine and a covid at the same time and I was out for two days.
15849,I Have had this spot on my arm for a few days now it started as a red splotch that started burning and then developed these blisters about a day ago. I keep getting told shingles but I Have had the chickenpox vaccine and have never had chickenpox. Also been told possibly psoriasis. Never experienced this before.
15850,Shingles at 35: I know people who got shingles after having the shot. it is rare but it does happen. Just saying. Nothing is certain. If you are still experiencing pain after you are healed get some capsaicin cream. It really does work wonders but do not put it on broken skin. .
15853,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Oh I had it for three months was bedridden and in a dark room. But the first two weeks was a kind of torture that I did not believe the most trained soldier could withstand. Both my husband and a nurse had to hold me down to keep me from scratching out my eye with my own fingers. I was screaming in agony. I feel bad for everyone else in neuro critical care at that time.
15854,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My LO 28 weeker got Beyfortus around 38 weeks during his nicu stay. Rsv season hit our area a bit later than the usual and I did it without hesitation since there were babies who had been exposed to it. He did have a minor set back w feeds since he got it w 3 other vaccines 2month vacs hepb. I month going to blame beyfortus on his set back because he did have them all at once.
15856,I Have had the two part vaccine and still got shingles twice. I Am told they were both mild cases but did not feel mild to me.
15857,Get your shingles vaccine: For anyone not considering the shingles vaccine I m not the type of person who likes putting extra stuff in my body but in this case I 100 would After seeing how much pain my mom has MS was in when she had it and she has a high pain tolerance No doubt. I m getting it as soon as I can. Felt so bad for her
15858,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: It depends on where she got it and probably other factors. My late husband always got it on his right leg above the knee. Small outbreak small scars but he had it several times during our 31 year marriage. Never had it anyplace else. My late mother the last time she had shingles had it on the entire upper third of her back. Poor thing she had dementia and a horrible case of shingles. Some scars from that sprinkled around like reverse freckles. So far I have never had it and I DID have chicken pocks somewhere around 1st or 2nd grade.
15860,Hi guys just want to share my story and complain about how useless doctors and even online information has been in this whole process. I got an itchy skin rash on my hands back in June and went to a dermatologist. Diagnosed with contact dermatitis got some cream and sent home. But it just kept getting worse. After the hand rash got way worse and my whole entire body started itching I went back again. Ohhh you do not have CD you have eczema Here Is some more creams and steroids and shit. And do not shower as much so your skin will not get so dry. A corticosteroid shot gave relief for like 23 days and then the itching persisted. It never got better. I would slather lotion on every day despite the patches of dry skin only appearing on my hands and wrists. So I started going to other dermatologists and getting more opinions and all of them would say its eczema and give me the same creams and pills that do not work. I would frequently cry at these appointments because I was itching SO BAD and had not slept more than 34h in a night in months cus of the itching. I Am googling daily and convincing myself I have hepatitis or cancer because this itching is so unbearable and persistent. I would always ask is not there any other explanation is there any other test I can do just to make sure because I cannot live like this any longer. I was diagnosed and treated for psychosomatic syndrome causing my itching and still could not sleep through the itching at night on a double dose of Valium. Finally have been going to the same derm once a week for over a month because hes the only one who even took the time to allergy test me not one sensitivity out of 120 common allergens tested and admitted it was weird to be this itchy and swore he would not give up on me. Despite the obvious tracks and skin flaking patterns and even locations of itching in between thumbs and hand in armpits and crotch he would not concede and insisted its eczema. Finally after weeks of this I convinced him it might be scabies after my bf also with no history of eczema got the same rash on his hands. All the doctors wanted to say its impossible and the similar environment was causing us to get the same rash and blah blah. Since last week I finally got the damn cream and started washing or bagging up all the shit in my house. Today after the 72h hold was up on touching things I gave my dog a bath. Sure enough she has scabies bumps under her fur Had any doctors taken 2 seconds to look closer at my skin thought about the pattern of itchy areas closer asked about my dog or anything else they would have found it and I would not have had to suffer for so many months. Why are doctors so adamant that you do not have scabies and will rather treat you for ANYTHING else for months or even years before even considering its a possibility? My bfs dermatologist tried to say he had shingles The education and literature about these parasites needs to be updated EXPEDITIOUSLY. I had all the classic signs and symptoms of scabies and rather than even considering scabies they would rather diagnose me with psychosomatic itching disorder even when there is a visible rash on my skin. I Am so frustrated and do not understand.
15865,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: From what I read, they recommend it even if you got the chickenpox vaccine and never actually had the full blown virus"
15870,Shingles vaccine: Mine was bad but not that bad. I think mostly I just wanted to sleep the entire next day and had a headache. But so glad I did get it because I still got shingles a couple months ago And from what I could surmise it was a wayyy more mild case than it usually is. Worst of it was over within a week and only a handful of blisters. It was still awful to be clear but I got on antivirals as soon as I started getting the rash and kept reading Reddit accounts of it lasting like six weeks and being excruciating so I felt like I got off easy.
15872,It seems the vast majority of users in this sub are taking what I previously thought was a large does TID. I see many people taking anywhere from 400mg TID to 1000mg TID and reporting all kinds of longterm issues mainly addiction withdrawal and tolerance in various forms. I have postherpetic neuralgia from shingles which I recovered from at the beginning of January for context. I can tolerate the very mild pain during the day but it ruins my sleep quality even months after the illness and nothing OTC has worked. Initially I was taking 300mg prescribed gabapentin before bed each night. Then my script ran out and my sleep quality noticeably went down. A few weeks went by until I called my primary to refill my script. Now I am taking 100mg before bed and my sleep quality is great. Until finding this sub today I did not know there was addiction withdrawal and tolerance potential. It has me questioning whether my sleep quality going down after stopping taking gabapentin the first time was actually a mild withdrawal side effect and not entirely due to the little bit of postherpetic neuralgia I am still experiencing. I am not overly worried since it seems like the people talking about addiction and withdrawal arewere taking at least 10x that amount daily for extended periods of time. But I still want to know what is going on. Has anyone on lower doses had any issues during or after stopping using gabapentin?
15874,My son is 26 and unjabbed but his wife was. Her grandmother would not see her unless she took it. Hes had shingles 2 times that shocked the doctor with his age. My dad took one shot and got shingles and my mother.. unjabbed died of a stroke who was healthy.
15875,My exhusband got the vaccine booster. He also got shingleshe passed away 3 years to the exact time he got injected That is why he divorced me I want to know how I can go about launching a classaction lawsuit?
15877,Just kind of need to get this off my chest. It will be a long one.. 35m was in good health. Had a weak immune system. Always handled drugs well prescription and none. Was happy healthy strong and smartwith tendencies to make bad decisions I started having pains in the left side of my groin. Went to see many walk in doctors and no one had any answers for me. The pain moved into my glute and for sure I thought I had an infection that was spreading through my body. Finally on maybe my 10th try at a new walk in the doctor said its prostatitis and gave me 2 weeks of cipro. So thankful I washa. Started taking the cipro and after about a week I had no signs of getting better. Was getting a slight headache but I was kind of prone to headaches any ways and did not think anything of it. At about a week in I went back to the doctor and told him it was not working. He told me to just stick with it that I maybe need to be on the medication for 4 to 6 weeks before things got better I am pretty sure he was trying to kill me. At about 3.5 weeks I saw my family doctor he told me he thought it might be nerve damage the original pain I told him about the other doctors diagnosis and asked if it was normal to take cipro for this long. He replied by telling me he is seen people on it for 6 months they must be dead 100. So I kept taking it. At about 5 weeks into the cipro I caught shingles and stopped taking the cipro. After the shingles died down the left side of my body started to get inflammed. I thought for sure it is the original infection spreading it all started on my left side. Then it hit my spine the worst spinal pain I have ever experienced. could not sleep for 2 weeks I could literally feel every bone in my spine. Knew this was bad so I went to the hospital 4 times 3 different cities. First visit had a decent doctor I still thought I had a serious infection. She gave me some shot to in her words kill anything inside of me. 2nd visit bad doctor. Came in complaining about spinal pain and she gave me an ultrasound on my balls. Then I pretty much forced her to give me a penicillin. Still thinking it was an infection that cipro did not clear up. 3rd visit Toronto. For sure the best hospital in ontario one of the top 5 in the world can figure this out for me. Nope said I had sciatic pains and sent me home with some pain killers. 4th visit hamiltion a teaching hospital. Surely some younger doctor will be curious enough to investigate this further. Nope listened to my story and told me I had anxiety and referred me for mental health. What a dick the future is grim. So with no help I was left to die that is what it felt like. As the pain started climbing my spine it eventually made it to my brain. I was literally high for 2 weeks without pause. I woke up high I went to sleep high. I could barely communicate with my family. The pain in the left side of my back was so extreme. I was in the worst physicalmental pain of my life. Started seeing my family doctor on a monthly basis. Was falling apart quickly and he seemed curious at first but after a few tests and a few visits he went with the anxiety diagnosis. I was pissed wasted 4 months with him. Saw the doctor who originally prescribed the cipro he referred me to an internist. The internist ran a ton of tests and images on my first visit he genuinely seemed concerned about me. He also sent me to a number of other specialists something my family doctor refused to do. So I waited saw many specialists all which just wrote me off blood tests seemed normal. Best diagnosis i got was fibromyalgia what a joke. I had a cyst on left shoulder where alot of my pain was. Cysts are signs of infection I thought. Another one on my liver. For sure this is infection related. Stools were full of mucus clay colored barely formed. Also the pain kept sweeping through my body into my right glute and up my back. My arms and legs. At about 9 months out there was not a single piece of me the did not hurt and my libido also disappeared. So I have lost everything that makes me me. My strength my smarts my ambitions my sex drive. All gone still gone to this day. I miss the old me very much. I literally pretend to be the old me for my families sake. Like new me does not want to move but what would old me be doing right now. It was not until about 10 months that I realized it may not be infection and that the anti infectant might have caused all this. Destroyed a man with a young family. Over a dozen doctors and none of them know that 5 weeks of cipro could destroy someone. I had to figure it out on my own. Started taking all the recommended supplements pretty much anything I could get my hands on. Now I am focused on detoxing. My lymphatic system is all clogged up. Wierd pain in my right side thinking it might be my kidney. Hopefully the other one holds up my egrf is 112 so I am hopeful. My cholesterol levels are through the roof I am guessing it is a microbiome issue. Pain in my feet. They feel swollen but are not. they are cold. But seem to be getting a little better since the supplements. Puffiness under my eyes which may or may not be related. I get bad anxiety still especially when I wake up and think about how much my life has been ruined. I lost nearly a year with my family. Missed a special age of my kids that ill never get back. Still alot of pain everywhere but the supplements helped alot. Dammit I cannot belive this happened to me. I try to get past it but it is hard. Still taking a 2 hour nap mid day just to get away from reality I can also barely keep my eyes open it is not really by choice. Well if you have read this. Thank you for your time. I could keep going but at the point my head hurts and I can barely focus. I go to sleep every night praying ill wake up from this nightmare. Wish my fellow floxies all the best. Thanks for letting me vent.
15878,Shingles vaccine: I got Shingrix and no other effects other than the arm.
15879,"Vaccine question: I'm 41 and got the shingles vaccine on recommendation from my GI and rheumatologist. My wife came down with shingles a few years ago and it wasn't pleasant. I don't know how my autoimmune conditions (I have two of them) would respond to having shingles...and I don't want to find out. But listen to your GI. Consider a new GP, preferably one that has some experience with managing patients living with UC or Chron's."
15880,1 Due to my low functioning immune system I got the shingles vaccine this week several decades earlier than recommended. My arm hurts more than any other vaccine I Have gotten but you know what? Its way less painful than SHINGLES My friend got it in their early 30s and it
15883,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Got it. Hurt like a bitch But Id do it again.
15887,1st time Shingles developed an allergic rash to valacyclovir: Is that an allergic reaction? I know nothing about shingles just started but hives  red bumps was for me a symptom of shingles.
15889,Shingles vaccine: I have gotten shingles... It fucking sucks. Get the vaccine you to not want shingles
15890,Because people are not taking the supplies. And its exactlly that demographic who should not have it. Speaking as someone who vaccinated. One of the biggest side effects of the shingles vaccine is shingles and you may also want to look up the adverse reports of vaginal herpes too.
15891,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: So much this I had it once got the vaccine and then got it again. I knew exactly what it was before the rash showed up and my doctor knew I could not have it since I would already been vaccinated. He only prescribed the antiviral after I nearly jumped off the table from a nerve zinger
15894,Has anyone else gotten a covid booster AND shingles at the same appointment?: Thanks so much for responding. For each covid vaccine I Have had a really STRONG immune response comes on at almost exactly 13hrs and is finally gone at nearly 36. I know shingles is supposed to suck so I guess that just explains the next couple days. I literally just got the new booster today so if you are looking I feel like a drug dealer saying this some pharmacies have them in small quantities.
15898,Times are tough for everyone nowadays huh? I wish there was a more long term solution nobody on this planet should be going hungry I hate it. Anyways long story short my job has not had hardly any hours available to work and we desperately need some help with bills groceries the only two things we ever spend money on. On the super off chance anyone has good connections for jobs in Florence Arizona let me know. EDIT Here is my Amazon grocery wish list. Thanks again for everyone helping me figure this out and the additional resources. kind of unrelated but I saw in the rules you could either post an Amazon wish list or a Go fund me. A little over a year ago my wife created a Go Fund Me for me after I got a debilitating case of shingles. It did not do so well because I do not know many people and it is closed now obviously so I will not bother linking it but I highly recommend people get their shingles vaccine. I still have nerve damage I might not ever fully recover from and it never leaves my mind for more than a minute. Still owe thousands of dollars in medical I have been avoiding too. Caught it at 27 years old. Take care of yourself people.
15906,Shingrix?: I am going to be inquiring at the health department about this it is not urgent as I am experiencing an outbreak of shingles but I have had several people in my area say that insurance will not cover it for younger folk and that is why. I am definitely not taking that as an official answer I am just curious about it. I just find the whole thing odd because I have had a lot more vaccination than the general population because I work in healthcare and our employers recommend additional things. I do have to provide t it ers that show my immunity from the initial varicella infection back in the 1980 s. I think the only people eligible for that particular vaccination varicella have never contracted chicken pox or their t it ers no longer show immunity immunity. I was never eligible for the chicken pox vaccine.
15908,Shingles: Same I think the official guidelines at this point do not require it for immune compromised young people so its not part of the whole vaccine variety pack you get when you are diagnosed. I think they should put us in a medical journal or something to get that changed lollll I think it took about 2 weeks for me I had the red marks for a long time they just looked like zits but they are mostly gone now. I still have a small scar close to my eye but overall its cleared up pretty well Hope you get better soon
15914,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I fully expected to be laid out for a few days based on what I had heard from others but both of mine went off without a hitch. A little sore at the injection site for a day no systemic issues lethargy etc. I got lucky for sure.
15918,Paranoid about shingles: I got shingles pretty soon after going on Oc rev us. I think I had to pay out of pocket to get the vaccine after that because insurance wouldn t cover it since I m under 50.
15919,Did you or would you take the HPV gardisil 9 vaccine again ?: I mean if you want me to describe what going through cervical cancer was like I can do that. Take the fucking vaccine. I did not have the luxury.
15922,M was not speaking to or for your benefit. vaccine the shot I received was made from aborted fetus tissue live virus and is no longer available in the US. I stand by my first statement. You defined my recurrent shingles as HILARIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE. enough said
15924,First post here so Ill start with the backstory Married into a family that is mostly JN. BIL and his family are great. There Is an aunt who mostly keeps to herself except holidays and does not subscribe to the but you have to because FaMiLy philosophy that the rest of them seem to share. Otherwise its a guilt trip world tour. My biggest issue with the family centers around health concerns. Specifically that they have no concern for anyones health. I Am immunocompromised and most of them are convinced that no illness is contagious. JNaunt and JNuncle are the reason my then infant caught RSV at less than 6months old and the entire JNfamily denies the possibility that their sick teenager is the reason my son was almost hospitalized. JNMIL gave my son chicken pox and denies it because you cannot get chicken pox from someone with shingles so he must have picked it up while you were shopping. Thankfully he would had the first shot of the vaccine by that point so it was not as bad as it could have been. In his 3 short years my son has been sick at least a dozen times because of their denial that anyone is sickand I Have caught most of it from them directly or while caring for him. There Is also the issue of JNFILs blatant disregard for anyones privacy. Hes shown up unannounced numerous times and will open any piece of mail he can get his hands on. He also demanded to be joint on his sons bank accounts. JNMILs backhanded guilt trips would be a thing to behold if I were not on the receiving end of them so often. She loves to play the victim about not seeing her only grandson but rarely reaches out and usually has other plans when we invite her to anything. BB is not actually her only grandson. She just refuses to acknowledge BILs son because hes SILs from a previous marriage that they have raised together. The current situation I Have recently started a new medication that is working wonderfully but has further lowered my immune system. If I get sick I could be forced to stop my new medication until I Have cleared the illness which will most likely set back my progress. DH has suggested we video call his family on Christmas Eve rather than going in person because of past experiences. While I do not want to get sick I also do not want to deal with the fallout. I Have considered just masking up and leaving our toddler with my parents but that would have fallout of its own since we do not leave our son unsupervised with any of DHs family other than BIL and his wife but BB has stayed overnight with my parents numerous times. I know the right choice for my health is to avoid unnecessary exposure to anything but I also do not want to deal with JNFIL showing up in my driveway for JNMIL to scream at me. I do not want to have the you should really come because it might be Nans last Christmas conversation with DHs uncles aunts or cousins. My family did the it might be Grannys last insert reason to gather as a family for about a decade only for my greatgrandmother to pass away on Christmas Day the year nobody but my mom and I visited her and my grandmother they lived together for Christmas Eve. Admittedly Christmas can come with a bit of selfimposed guilt for me. DH is finally coming out of the FOG but maybe I descend into my own FOG this time of year. To add to the anticipated guilt trip BIL and his family are now spending Christmas Eve with us in solidarity because SIL is also immunocompromised and we have a longstanding weekly dinner and game night that they do not want to risk missing because the JNs got one of them sick. BIL and his family will not be subject to the same level of guilt trip because the JNs do not like SIL and believe she is poisoned BIL against the family but DH and I will get a double dose for this. I know my health is important and that its not selfish to put my health above their feelings. I just want to avoid the fallout but I do not see a way.
15927,Did anyone's dysautonomia get triggered by pregnancy?: VERY likely. I had severe pre eclampsia and got shingles immediately after delivery. It was misery. Now I Have got Dysautonomia eczema and other dermatitis issues I Have never ever had.
15928,Infections with biologics: Thank you. On top of ibd symptoms still though they are getting better I am always regularsick Just finished antiviral for the shingles and now I am on antibiotics for the giant oozing toe Got some cuts weeks ago and they are still sore and scabbing
15929,First shingles vaccine side effects: Yes that is exactly what happened to me
15931,"A magnet will not stick to vaccine injection hole: Sorry for the bad formatting I have done this on my phone. Today I (F22) had my COVID 19 vaccine. When my mum got home she took a magnet and trick to stick it to my vaccine arm, without asking. When I asked 'what are you doing?' She said 'just checking'. Last night I was told it would give me shingles, I would have heavy periods, I would be more depressed and kill myself, and that I'm damaging a temple of god the bible says you should not have them as it changed your DNA. This evening I have been told if I have any symptoms after then they were right. I have asthma meaning I have a cough always have, I have been told that now I have COVID and I'm going to hurt them and other people, I am why it's still spreading. I am not allowed to talk about the vaccine as it will annoy my mums husband, whilst he walks around saying vaccinated people are brain damaged and all going to hell for having them. When I do talk about it I am told I shouldn't try change their minds as they don't try change mine. My mother has since argued how she raised me to be better and betraying what she believes and wants is a sign I don't appreciate my upbringing and disrespecting her. Edit: my mum is an amazing woman and she has treated me so well and been the best mum I could ask for. Just has a little crazy on the side and that makes life interesting. Edit 2: thank you for all the awards and advice! It's nice to see I'm not over reacting or over thinking this situation!"
15933,2 month old male. No medical history. Uncomplicated birth. In Canada. Mainly looking to get a second opinion. We had requested to get the RSV vaccine for our 2mo old our GP had no problem writing the prescription for Abrysvo. It was administered  2 weeks later we receive a call for our GP that she made an error and he was given the wrong vaccine was pretty nonchalant about it. Upon looking into it further and calling Pfizer this is actually a vaccination for pregnant women and not children it has never been administered to anyone under the age of 18. I was wondering if anyone could provide any insight or info on the long term effects this could because or if any. Hes has eczema appear in the last week which I do not think is related but with having 0 information on the vaccine it is always in the back of my head when something new appears.
15934,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Got me some antiviral yesterday so I am hangin' in there. Just another thing to add onto my shitty knees and a bad back. Although I did hit rshingles for some empathetic support and it turns out 90 of the posters are 3035 years old
15935,Shingles vaccine: I would take it. I Have suffered from shingles many times but it has not been as severe as it could have been thanks to the vaccine
15937,I was in so much pain I took Advil for weeks on end and spent 3 separate weeks in the ICU. Bleeding ulcer. GET YOUR SHINGLES VACCINE
15939,RSV vaccine for infants.: We got for our baby. No significant side effects or fussiness or anything. That was a couple of months ago and hes fine
15941,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I wanted to save time last year asked the nurse if I could combine pneumonia COVID flu and Rsv. Thought I was going to die after the shakes and fever got me.
15942,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: The most concerning part about this is him locking your baby in the car to control you. That was abusive. I personally would rather have chickenpox than the vaccine as my daughter had shingles as a side effect from her vaccine. However purposefully infecting someone is child and interfering with their parenting choices is batshit crazy. I know those scars are concerning to you but those will fade. I feel pretty certain this is not the first time he has displayed controlling behaviors. I hope you are really thinking about if this is a relationship that you want to continue or not. I recently read Why Does He Do That? If you search on Reddit there are lots of free links floating around. I think you might find it helpful. I am sorry you are going through this.
15944,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: you can see this lady is totally obstructed at her upper airway. She is trying to breathe but her chest is going inwards on inspiration not outwards. Known as paradoxical breathing. By the looks of things she would not be oxygenating at all. If she had not been turned into coma position by the people left lateral she could have died of hypoxia no oxygen to the brain or heart.
15945,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: Does Not matter to me who chooses to do it anyway. But it should be an openly known and listed side effect for people who want to educate themselves or know what to look out for. I had no idea what it was until a lot of nerve damage had set in and it was contagious to my infant who was too young to have been vaccinated
15948,I had no reaction to the shingles vaccine except a sore are both times.
15949,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: I'm able to get my second after 4 March. The first one hurt a lot. Sore arm for a few days. I'd rather that than shingles."
15950,So nurse who gave me my shingles vaccine yday told me Id feel a little rough for a whileserious understatement LOL
15955,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in 1994 was vaccinated AND caught it the oldfashioned way albeit a much milder case than it would have been without the vaccine
15957,Shingles how can I boost my immune system?: The first time was nasty. It crossed the center line and I had patches from feet to the neck. Took about 3 weeks before my skin could accept clothing without minor protest. 2nd time was more manageable with just a small patch on my flank maybe a week. No lasting effects I made damn sure to follow the med regimen.
15959,Vaccines: thank you I have never tolerated the yearly flus and covid shots well. Always knocked me flat on my ass for days. The only one I will consider down the line is for shingles. I Am not sure I want to mess with the potential for shingles later on in life
15960,It is shingles caused by the covid vaccine stop lying and doing business.
15963,: I got the vaccine now I have vestibular migration does anyone know if there is a link
15964,31 yr old male: I am vaccinated and had no reaction at all
15967,Shingles vaccine: Seconded  though my second was worse than my first honestly I would not have been up to Thanksgiving cooking after either. Id personally roll the dice on Friday if possible.
15968,"Draw a tattoo to cover my shingles scar?: Recovering from shingles (2/10 would not recommend) and this is likely going to scar. My wife suggested a cover up tattoo once it's all healed. Any ideas? My interests are video games (Pokemon, Metroid, Mass Effect, and most recently Destiny 2), fishing, dogs (lost my 9 yr old black lab last year), nature in general, and history stuff."
15973,Hi I Am 42F with CML and Crohns Disease. CML is controlled with my last numbers being .006. Crohns is in Remission. I noticed a lump on the bottom of my neck where it meets the top of my shoulder a couple of weeks ago. A week ago I noticed a lump on the side of my neck almost straight down from my ear lobe. Same side as the first lump. They do not feel like normal swollen lymph nodes from when I Am sick not that means anything I do get illness a lot it seems. For instance from SeptemberDecember I had a stomach bug pneumonia and covid. I Have had shingles twice and seem to attract random things. That being said I have not felt sick at all since finding the lumps. Imatinib400mg Stelara Allegra Pepcid for hives never figured out why I get hives Up to date on all vaccines including shingles but have not had any lately. Something worth emailing my oncologist or PCP over? Or just wait and see? I know I should not but I feel silly emailing or calling over something that is most likely nothing. Thanks
15976,I had a small case of shingles in 2019 in my 40s. For a few days now I have the tingling and itching in the old shingles spot from back then. It is definitely the same sensation. Do I have to brace myself for a definite flareup or is it possible it is kept in check and does not go beyond tingling and itching? No obvious rash yet although my scratching half asleep... may have caused a single small red dot. It is been around 5 days and it has not gotten worse. Thanks for any insight
15985,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I got nuked for the weekend with shot 1. Shot2 did absolutely nothing. Weird. Good luck Its worth it.
15987,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: got them both was like a donkey kick to the nuts. and now I have tinnitus in my right ear. but I would still get them again. do not want no part of shingles. and now there is some early evidence it help prevent dementia.
15989,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Yups. However I got the shingles at 19. And had the chicken pox vaccine. Doctors were baffled.
15990,My husband M 32 160 lbs is generally healthy and has had shingles twice in his life already. I do not want to have him go to the doctor for a normal rash but I think we are both a little paranoid. He got these bumps on his arm about 2 days ago and was complaining they itch. I included a photo from them vs today they look angrier and more irritated. The first time the rash was on his ribcage the second was on his back. This is his arm
15991,Persistent varicella zoster virus infection following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was associated with the presence of encoded spike protein in the lesion
15995,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I am still numb on the left side of my groin into my labia because of shingles. My neuropathy became much worse post shingles too. Would not give me a vaccine because I was 49 when I had it. I am 51 now and as soon as I could I got one. They said that if you have had it once you are likely to develop it again.
15997,RSV vaccine decision ON: My 5 month old currently has RSV. She received the new vaccine technically it is antibodies not a vaccine. I am so glad I did. No doubt she would be in the hospital it is quite brutal. She is wheezing breathing fast and we can see her ribs when she is breathing. The doctor confirmed she has bronchiolitis. She is stable now and I am grateful I was able to do something to help lessen her suffering.
15999,What did it feel like for you when you took your first dose?: Everyone is different in how they handle it. Some people do not get any side effects at all. I had extreme energy and anxiety very vivid dreams headaches and a very high libido But if you google and talk to people who have taken it and research what side effects you might have then it is a lot easier to handle once you know what to expect possibly. Like for instance anxiety you could take kava or another calming supplement to counteract the anxiety. But the side effects do go away.
16000,I got the shingles vaccine and Covid on the same day and was fine .
16001,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: The reactions I had were nothing compared to the damage shingles itself did.
16002,I figured its better than getting shingles I was expecting worse with the second dose but it was not. Just needed a long nap
16005,Waiting for outbreak to clear then 1st dose Shingrix: I had my first outbreak on June 8 2024 on my upper right side and trust me it was the worst. It affected my breast and forget about the pain and sensitivity. As of today August 1 I am still experiencing pain and my skin is so sensitive until I cannot wear the appropriate clothing. The dark spots are so dark and being a dark skin person I doubt if they will go away. So I am waiting for the symptoms to cease so I can get the 1st vaccine by September. I pray that all of will recover without any longterm issues as indicated.
16008,Maybe eat lightly before taking. But so good to get it done and not have shingles. I have had them previously and worth a day of tummy troubles for the vaccine.
16012,LArginine and LCitrulline use can trigger shingles in adults who have had chicken pox: I do not think I have ever had larginine and lcitrulline I have had amino acid spiked protein powders. But I did have some bad hive break downs a few months back. And the walkin clinic allergy specialist said it was urticaria hives based on the pictures I showed him and said that it can be triggered by a virus or stress. Do shingles look like hives? The previous doctor at the clinic said it was bed bug bites. I know for sure I do not have bed bugs. Especially when I stopped getting these hives for awhile now. I was going to order preworkout when I finish up my caffeine pills. But I am afraid to try preworkout now. As I did have chicken pox as a kid. I have been doing just caffeine and carbs for pre up until now.
16013,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome in my right foot and its apparently the same kind of nerve pain as what you now have. Its known as the most painful condition known to medical science also called The scide disease as many with full body just cannot cope with the extreme pain. I Have had it 18 years and do not really know how I Have made it this far but I live day to day it s the only way. I Am so sorry to hear you have had this new horror to deal with. You Are absolutely right to warn others to get the jab I had a very mild case. Did Not even realise I had it. Until it would not go away and was so itchy I fortunately did not have the severe nerve pain  like my foot 247 just some discomfort. Take care 
16015,First I am not antivaccine. I believe in the science. But be aware that this vaccine series does not always prevent you from getting shingles. My former boss had the 1st vaccine then the 2part one when it came out. He still got shingles but not as bad as unvaccinated.
16018,41 and got Shingles: I turned 41 this year and got them the month of my birthday. It sucked. I Am better now but still have lingering nerve pain and scars from the spots. Hang in there and just try to rest and recover. I struggled for about 6 weeks to get it all cleared up. Edit to say that it started as a deep nerve pain under my left shoulder blade. The spots first appeared on my left side and then eventually wrapped from back to front on my whole left side of torso. I feel blessed it was not on my face like some commenters. How terrible
16021,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: I had shingles 24 years ago and got permanent nerve damage. I have experienced the pain of shingles every day since. Nothing the shot can do is as bad as actually getting shingles.
16022,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Brother was 6. He was miserable for about 2 days and then was fine. Sister was 10. She was in bed for 2 days third day felt better fine by day 4. I was 13. Could Not get out of bed for 5 days.
16023,"Just got my second HPV vaccine and I'm feeling pretty rough. Joint pain, fatigue, and a slight fever have got me down. Any advice on how to ease these side effects? #HPVvaccine #sideeffects #healthcare"
16027,Shingles vaccine: I Have had Shingles before and it was sheer hell I still have scars. So YES I got vaccinated and no it was not bad.
16029,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chickenpox when I was a few years old do not remember having it and I do not know if I was at a chickenpox party. At 39 I got shingles. Luckily on my lower abdomen so it was not too bad except it felt like weeks of having an open wound there. And I got to the doctor early on being confused about the weird rash and got medication. They said it would help treat it and also prevent nerve damage. So I was lucky
16030,Shingles and PHN Experience: Thanks for the info. I will give it a try. The pain is not bad during the daymostly an annoying itch with the occasional twinge of a sharp stabbing pain and no blistering so farbut lying down at night everything feels like it is on fire. Gabapentin did not help at all and it made me nauseous. But two 500 mg tabs of Tylenol snuffed the pain and I was finally able to sleep for about four hours. Which is so bizarre because Tylenol is usually ineffective for any pain I might have. Advil always my drug of choice. I am going to try alternating those today see what happens.
16032,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am so sorry. Got shingles due to incredible stress. The pain.
16035,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Did it. Cost a few bucks and kicked my ass as I developed antibodies but I will take that any day over shingles
16036,Bf diagnosed with shingles will I get chickenpox: My bf is on week 3 of his shingles. I touched the rash before it was blistering because we also did not know what it was. I Have never had chicken pox and I think I got the vaccine as a child also but never the booster shot. I was paranoid about getting them after we found out what they are but I never got them. I actually slept in the same bed as him just a pillow between us and did the laundry also. I Am not sure about the joint pains and headaches but I do think there were a couple times I almost convinced myself I was catching it
16042,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I got shingles when I was in middle school. It fucking sucked especially trying to play sports and having that spot get hit randomly. It is supposed to be worse the older you get so I am sure it would be much worse today but it was like having 100 mosquito bites in one area that I wanted to scratch the fuck out of but the second I touched it hurt like hell.
16043,33mHouston Hispanic 6'0 225lbs. On my waist line appeared four white raised painful spots. They slowly transformed into this over 4 days getting slowly purple until it is stayed like this for about a week now. Worrysome it is not going away and painsoreness super consistent. I did note a very small red streak leading away from the bites but it was so faint I suspected garment pressure was the because. Redness has not spread otherwise it is sore and sensitive to the touch and it is been a consistently painful 110. No other symptoms and no recent meds. Just got a Botox shot a week ago for massater pain but that is the only recent meds if it is related. I can say that I feel some pain in areas surrounding bite like my leg seems to ache a bit and abdominal region near it. Ache is minor but overall unsure what to do. Link to photo  Update  Saw a free standing ER room Physician. He does not know what it was but bets it is probably a bite of some sort. Does not look like some disease or virus the nurse commented it looked like shingles but doctor dismissed that. The symptoms point to a small infection that is localized not necessarily spreading given the time frame and progression. Given bacterium and told to watch itgo to dermatology. Anyone have any idea?
16046,Hi just really looking for some peace of mind as my anxiety is getting the best of me. I would love to hear other peoples experiences with the effectiveness of the rsv vaccine antibodies if your baby was exposed afterwards. If you are a NICUPICU nurse do you see less babies in the unit that received vaccination? I have a 4 week old and a 2.5 year old who is in school. There is so much RSV going around that I am SO nervous about my little one catching it. I received the vaccine when I was 33 weeks pregnant and hoping she will avoid catching it.
16053,Cycle Day 1 At least that s what I m considering it to be even though I never ovulated. On September 15 day 2 of my last cycle I got the flu vaccine and dose 1 of the shingles vaccine. Usually I ovulate around day 18 but I hadn t by then. On day 23 I got my C covid booster booster. My cycle was clearly all messed up. On day 58 I had my second shingles shot. Then on day 70 I started prove ra and also ended up seeing EW CM and was worried I was ruining my chance of ovulation but I was also feeling sick so I figured it s best to just go through with the prove ra my husband was sick for a couple weeks before me so I knew my body could end up not ovulating and trying to focus on getting better. Turns out I had C covid and RSV and fortunately the prove ra still did its job while I was resting. Today I started bleeding Finally Here s to hoping I go back to my normal cycles
16059,A study suggests a rare adverse event of shingles reactivation may occur in rare cases following the RZV vaccine though the vaccine's benefits still outweigh the risks. Learn more
16061,"Shingles vaccine: second dose: I didn't have any major reaction to either dose, but the shots themselves HURT. I'm good with needles, and have a high pain tolerance, and these shots HURT like HELL."
16063,This one will bring out the Pfizer Bots: You got Shingles after the receiving the vaccine
16065,Suggested vaccine: that is not true across the board. Many of us have nasty hyper immune reactions to certain vaccines that can because adverse issues. I had shingles and it was just really annoyingly itchy for a few weeks. everyone is situation is unique and needs to weigh pros and cons.
16066,"Shingrix Reaction: Hello everyone, looking for some guidance regarding the Shingrix vaccine reaction my elderly mother experienced. Here are the specifics: - Age: 70 years - Sex: Female - Height: 5'4"" - Weight: 135lbs - Race: Asian - Duration of complaint: 36 hours - Geographic Location: New York City, USA - Body Location: Back/Systemic - No past medical history - Medications: Blood pressure medication Following her Shingrix vaccination, my mother developed a raised, red patch on her back at the injection site. A day later, she started feeling fatigued and noticed a slight fever. The pharmacist mentioned these could be common side effects, but I'm worried about how long they might persist. Any advice on when these symptoms are expected to improve? [Back Rash](<url>)"
16068,10 Ways to Stay SAFE While Traveling: I got the shingles shot about 15 years ago and they told me I will not need another one and now they want me to. My 20 year old son was in the Navy and got shingles right when he finished a class that was the hardest in the Navy. Took 2 months to reach his ship after that.
16069,I messed up a shingles shot today: Thank you both for the support. I definitely took a sting to my confidence but you guys are right mistakes happen
16070,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Fun fact some people like me do not develop an immune response to the vaccine and do not develop antibodies to the virus. I have had regular chicken pox twice 2 yo and 12 yo. Had to be hospitalized at 12 with my cousin who was 13 and had never had it. We were miserable. I have had Bellss Palsy 3 times. The first 2 times I figured out after the fact that I had exposure to varicella doctors are assuming the 3rd time as well. I have had the chicken pox vaccine twice and the shingles vaccine once at 24 because my doctors wanted to see if it would help me develop antibodies. My body could care less my titer is still 0. I Am 40 now hoping I do not get shingles for a long time but have been told to expect to get them multiple times
16074,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 37. Vaccinated. I got shingles at 27 after delivering my child and they blame it on the fact I got the vaccine.
16076,my first bout of shingles was aged 13 on my backlink? Cold sores since age 4 Ever since then I Have been getting shingles on my neck I get shingles once or twice a year? I Am 29 now. Lots of childhood trauma audhd ocd colon issues have a scan coming up eczema athsma pmdd pcos is there a link with all this and shingles or no? I Am open to holistic remedies as well does not have to be a western medicine is what I Am saying can anyone send links or drop info about why my bodys doing this? I am hygenic daily I isolate I do stress a lot. I guess. I have just done a blood test so will go from there when I get results but all my westernised doctors have no idea about anything I mention its so bad.
16082,Some Singapore doctors see more patients with shingles over past 2 years: I was once on a holiday job during my uni break which was intensely stressful to the point that I dreaded going to work everyday. Then one day I felt that my left hand was become quite sensitive to cold water when washing hands and warm water felt more comfortable. One or two days later I realised I had what I thought were rashes on the skin from the tip of my thumb all the way to the left shoulder joint. I went to the polyclinic and they diagnosed me with shingles got me on antiviral medication and told me to rest at home. It was itchy while healing and uncomfortable but it was not as painful as I thought it would be which I felt that was due to the affected area being a less sensitive area unlike parts of the torso up to the neck. I recovered within one week of seeing the doctor though the patches of tiny clustered blister scars remained a little longer. After that episode I felt like it was my body reacting to the stress that I had felt in that period. I am not sure how true it is but it seems like stress could be a factor? We all have had experienced the effects of stress suppressing our immune system like the body falling sick immediately after school exams have ended so I feel like could the increase in shingles cases be a symptom of stress?
16083,First shingles vaccine side effects: I could not lift my arm up for like 2 days and could not sleep on my side for much longer.
16084,Shingles vaccine: I got flu like symptoms for a couple of days it was not fun. But I know two people who have gotten shingles and it lasted for months. One got it in her eyes and had not just double vision but quadruple vision for several months not to mention the painful rash on her forehead. The other had the rash on her side and said it was one of the most painful things she is ever experienced. A few days of discomfort does not compare.
16085,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: At age 50. The week before my 51st birthday in March my doctor suggested my partner drive me to my next appointment so I could get the shingles vaccine I tend to have strong reactions. I made the appointment and then three days later woke up with shingles. I got on an antiviral immediately. It still sucked but at the antiviral medication worked quickly and the bad part only lasted a week. The bad part is as bad as everyone says. I still recommend getting the vaccine if you can and everyone I know over 50 got it after witnessing my experience but if you do get shingles antiviral meds will shorten the duration dramatically.
16086,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: My first shingles vaccine was also at the same time as a covid booster and a flu shot. That was a wild few days. Compared to that the second shingles shot was a breeze lol.
16087,There Is a little white bump on my clit that looks just like a wart but I do not have any STIs and I was immunized for HPV i am a trans man so i am a little hesitant about seeing a gynecologist in fear of being judged has anybody else had something similar and may know what it is?
16088,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: You would have to provide sources to make such a claim. At this time the major side effect of HPV vaccine is the same as other vaccines sore arm feeling under the weather for 12 days fainting rare and a vasovagal response. Any scientific research I Have ever read on it and I work with vaccines do not support your claim.
16089,I Have been going on 11 months since my last dose of finasteride and since I stopped I thought my cognitive symptoms would abate but everyday I still have difficulties with choosing finding and retrieving words especially when its a deep and hardly used word. I was a very articulate person before who could have sophisticated and high level theoretical conversations about any subject I now stumble and need at times a minute to get the words that will make sense or I have choose a lower or related word. This has brought be immense stress. I Have gained weight I Have started to have physical issues and now I have shingles brought on by intense stress. I Am just venting here but if you can all let me know how you have dealt with this disorder or learned to cope with it Id be very appreciative.
16090,I was prescribed gabapentin 300mg BID and Tylenol with Codeine T3 for shingles. 68F I took 3 doses of gabapentin and it did help keep the pain manageable. But the dizziness and general out of my head feeling is bad. The last dose was the second night before bed and I had taken a T3 an hour before. I had crazy out of my mind dreams and felt almost paralyzed while going to sleep. I ended up sleeping well and the paralyzation feeling did not last through the night but I did not feel normal. When I got up I felt pretty good. After being up and around for a few hours the pain came back so I took my fourth dose. It made me quite dizzy and gave me foggy brain. I Do Not Know if its the gabapentin or the combo with the T3. I did not take the gabapentin last night. Tried just the T3 and it does not really do much. Have ice pack on it now and that really helps but I cannot strap one on to walk around. My plan now is to try to not take either one Has anyone else had these type of side effects from the gabapentin?
16092,Most vaccines you have gotten at once postdiagnosis?: I do two at a time. I have to space them between my IVIG and I need extra doses of some of them. So I want to get it over with faster. I feel like I have a silly little routine down. Go to Walgreens take some Tylenol while I wait get shot grab some Powerade and Lipton chicken soup on my way out of the store go home just in time for my arms to start aching and rest. Shingles and pneumonia made me feel the most run down so maybe get those on their own. My pharmacy said I would have to get the RSV shot in a doctors office since I am not in the approved age group. It is a good idea to space it as long as possible between immunotherapies to give your body the best chance to make antibodies. 14 days sounds like the typical thing I was recommended too but I do my IVIG every other week so I can just wait a week in between. My immunologist also told me to get any bloodwork done as far out from treatments or vaccines as possible to get a better picture of my baseline.
16094,"""Flu Shot: Anyone else get the flu shot recently? I got mine a few days ago and I'm feeling really under the weather. It's like I have the flu, but I know it's just my body's immune response kicking in. How did you feel after getting the flu shot? Let's discuss our experiences!"""
16096,Thank the participants GSK Moderna HSV vaccine phase 2 trial recruitment is now complete Advocacy is still needed.: Participant here I am part of the GSK phase II trial. I have not had my first shot yet but its coming up in less than 2 weeks. Curious if any other GSK phase II trial participants know what their group number is 1 2 or 3 and if they had any reaction to their shot such as soreness at the injection site fever etc. If so please respond with your group number and the response symptom.
16098,Shingles vaccine experience: I Have had shingles outbreaks every 7 years for 55 years. I was standing in line when the vaccine was mad available. 3 rough days but lll likely be able to avoid another outbreak. If you are wondering shingles are hell.
16099,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: My worst day so far was day 11. I feared for my future. Are you taking lysine and avoiding arginine rich foods? I Am taking 3000mg of lysine a day 1000mg 3x a day. I found things turned a corner for me after I started that but it could have been a coincidence. I think we have it in really sensitive areas so its just much more painful. On my worst day I was taking oxycodone and it did not work. I cannot take Pregabalin I get some rare mental side effects from it. I Am trying to be patient eating healthy food trying to do relaxation exercises. Its the worst experience of my life.
16107,Just wanted to rant about my experiences trying to handle this insane illness. I am 34 and very unexpectedly came down with shingles 5 weeks ago. Still dealing with neuritis and pain from inflammation but fortunately nerve pain has subsided substantially. But oh my god every single prescription I have had for this causes me nearly equal problems one way or another. Valtrex Obviously most important for eradicating virus replication and SO important if you want to prevent complications as quickly as possible. Despite this I suffered intense kidney pain during the last day of my week long course. It was so excruciating that it triggered vasovagal syncope. I fainted thank GOD i did not get injured and had an ambulance called for me. I took my meds with food and at least 26oz of water every time. I know many people tolerate valtrex just fine but I would get the most intense spasms in my kidneys it hurt a LOT. Prednisone Anxiety insomnia ravenous appetite seriously altered mind state. I can not describe the hell that steroids are. It is like you feel stronger but you are actually getting weaker and more susceptible to stress. I suffer from anxiety hypertension and insomnia already and this drug was intensely difficult to even coexist with. I had to kick it immediately after my first 40mg dose. Not to mention potentially permanent side effects diabetes osteoporosis and even AVN where your fucking bones in your joints die. I could not sleep for 48 hours and that was completely intolerable. Gabapentin I was prescribed this for nerve pain. I can not even say what it is like without rambling on and on. This was by far the scariest thing to be under the influence of. It is as if your entire brain and nervous system are under a fog. I could have slept standing up. But this was terrifying to me I felt even more in my own head. I could feel the pain but it is like it was distant and unconnected to me. This drug above all made me not feel like myself. Oxy I hate opioids. I hate the intense lack of any emotion. I hate the night terrors. I hate the possibility of fucking up my life with addiction and personally am not comfortable taking powerful painkillers while alone. I know you are in pain take the painkiller etc but jesus CHRIST is it awful. My body hates being doped up. I would get the most intense horrific imagery in my eyes while falling asleep. Absolutely horrific. NSAIDs Does not do jack shit. Issued Naproxen barely helped at all. All that said I appreciate all of my docs immensely but it truly has felt like a revolving door of pain. Almost every medication I have tried has had equally discomforting effects to the acute pain from shingles. Mind you shingles pain is some of the worst I have ever felt in my life but I am so incredibly frustrated by how poorly treatment is understood. I have seen 7 different Kaiser Permanente doctors from ER to primary care and basically nobody can agree on a method every doctor has contradicted the last on what is the best medicine or what is best for my body. My primary doc actually told me to not consider prednisone at all meanwhile one of the ER docs and a different PCP said to take it. One doctor says it has dubious efficacy another says it is going to help. One doctor said to take gabapentin another said shelve it entirely for now. Anyway that is just my two cents. Rest well. It will get better.
16108,"After getting the Hepatitis A vaccine just before the pandemic hit, I noticed a sudden change in my sense of taste. Foods I used to love now tasted strange and unpleasant. I never considered myself a picky eater, but this reaction has been so bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the Hepatitis A vaccine?"
16109,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: This is interesting to me. I never had a reaction to any of the COVID shots and just recently had my first Shingles shot no reaction either. Not even a sore arm. I wonder what that bodes for the second shot...
16117,"Had to leave another job: This is 3 this year. I've got health problems: bi-polar, PTSD, OCD, panic disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome. The doctors are treating these things. This week I got shingles (2nd time in 2 years). The medication's side effects were bad, and didn't ease up after a couple days. I'd only been at the job for 2 weeks. It's a crappy delivery job. I don't even try for good jobs anymore. First it was depression, then anxiety, now I can hardly function. It took me 2 days to get the energy to take a shower. So now I'm unemployed again. Earlier this year I moved away from where I'd been living for 10+ years and bought a house in my hometown. I don't have any friends here. My only non-dog or cat in person communication is with my parents. They try to help, but there's not much they can do. I feel hopeless. I'm 41 a week from today. I can't even hold a delivery job. My immune system is a mess. This year alone, I've had bronchitis twice, strep, flu, a sinus infection, shingles and a cold or two. And that's not even bringing up all the mental issues. It's rough. I just wanted to say it to someone other than people who ask ""How can I help?"" Because I really don't have an answer to that."
16118,Third round of shingles since January: I had a horrific outbreak 2 years ago that put me in the hospital in neuro critical care for 5 days total eight days in hospital. It was on my scalp face and in my eye on the cornea. It tried to scratch out my own eye with my fingers it was so painful. Even Di lau did not stop the pain. After I got home the pain did not end and I was diagnosed with PH N and recurrent shingles. Two years later I am still on a preventative dose of va lacy clo vi r to prevent recurring outbreaks. My pain treatment team has just prescribed me a compounded prescription with ketamine to apply topically. I have had the shin gri x vaccines as well. And it still wants to resurface. Most Dr s don t even believe it recurs. If this isn t hardcore then I don t want to know what is and I certainly don t want to experience it.
16121,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was born in 1985 and by the time I was in middle school I still had not contracted chicken pox I was one of the first kids vaccinated. My classmates were always shocked I never had it. Then my mom forgot my younger brother did not get the vaccine and he got chicken pox as a teenager from the hockey locker room. He was miserable. I know this is gross but I totally touched him to see how effective my vaccine was. Bahahahahaha they checked my titter levels during all of my pregnancies and I Am still gucci. Id say I feel like I lucked out but I ended up getting H1N1 and COVID pretty bad. H1N1 gave me a weird rash all over my torso for a solid month and I was pretty miserable during that. Doctors chalked it up to a viral rash from h1n1.
16123,Once the scabs get darker what estimate timeline is it for them and other symptoms to go away..??: Oh my god a month of that sounds like fking torture. Good luck to you I hope you catch a break as soon as possible. I hope I never get shingles again as a first time for it in my 30s this has felt bizarre as hell.
16126,I got shingles after my sepsis infection when my immune system was shot. It surfaced on my forehead above my eye felt like a 8 day migraine and affected my eyesight for 18 months. Get the vaccine if you can..
16130,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: TIL there is a chickenpox vaccine. I got it as a kid without a party but I remember the South Park episode about it thinking that is insane I thought they would made it up
16133,I am 32 and going through shingles a second time is this abnormal?: I had a bad case of shingles in my thirties due to stress. Then a very mild case later in life although I had weird pain to the touch in my groin where my leg connected to my torso. The rash was on my backside.
16134,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: Thank you very much And hope things go better for you as well. After your Shingrix shots 1 and 2 Did you experience flare ups in pain? Did it recede later if so? Thank you
16138,Shingles Is NO Joke: Got shingles once. Lordy they sucked. I blocked a lot of it out. Hurt so bad. Never been struck by lightning but whatever I think would be electricity shooting through my body that was shingles.
16139,Shingles Is NO Joke: Everyone I know who has had it has gotten really sick from it and most people continue to have chronic flares. My husband had it spread across his chest and the wounds were GNARLY.
16140,"Starting Aubagio: Hello all, I posted about a month ago or so about my MS diagnosis, the plan was for me to start Gilenya. I went through the required tests(eye exam, ekg, and blood work), even received my first month of pills within like 2 weeks of being diagnosed(which are now worthless) and was just waiting for the go ahead from my Dr to start. I had an mri of my spine and neck and they found lesions, which were expected based on some symptoms I'm having. This morning I had an EMG to see how severe the nerve damage was to my right leg, I could definitely feel the difference between my right and left leg. They also decided to start me on Aubagio(today!) instead of Gilenya. Apparently I test negative for ever having chicken pox(vzv?) even though I had the vaccine when I was younger. Getting shingles/chicken pox while on Gilenya could be deadly from what my dr said. So I was just curious what everyone's experience has been on Aubagio? I searched through the posts here and didn't see much posted on it, or I may have not gone far enough back, sorry if that was the case. Thanks to anyone that reads this or replies!"
16142,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Happens. Mine lasted about that long. Just tell yourself its better than shingles.
16147,Put me out of my misery.: Shingles PSA Horror Story Time My Shingles vaccinated but Immunosuppressed Hubby got Shingles that spread body wide including Shingles lesions on the Myelin Sheath at C4 C5 and in to his Spinal fluid. He was hospitalized for 2 months. His official diagnosis was Disseminated Herpes Zoster DHZ which occurs when the VaricellaZoster Virus VZV spreads beyond the initial dermatome. It caused Viral Myelitis all over body weakness and muscle deterioration akin to a Spinal cord injury and Hemiparesis right side paralysis akin to a Stroke. Hes been out of the Hospital for about 2 12 months and still can not walk without his walker. He cannot work. He cannot take care of himself independently. Hes doing PT. And has endless Dr visits. My PSA.. Get the Vaccine And do it stat if you are Immunosuppressed andor Immunocompromised after checking with your Dr of course. The Vaccine likely saved my Hubbys life and definitely kept it from spreading to his brain. He barely survived with the Vaccine. My own bout with Shingles was very mild but still awful. I was not old enough for the Vaccine. Good luck fellow GenXers May the odds be ever in your favor.
16148,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born 1981. I got chickenpox the old fashioned way at my daycarepreschool age 3 in 1984 along w my entire class. It was the worst case of chickenpox my pediatrician had seen in his 30 yrs of practice. I was gravely ill and covered head to toe in pox literally EVERYWHERE. Of course I now have massive scars pock marks on my face and all over my body. The worst one on the tip of my nose. I was tested for antibodies at age 37 while undergoing IVF along w Measles Mumps Rubella and came back NEGATIVE for antibodies for all of them. MMR lasts about 2030 years for the majority of people. It is really a vaccine to protect babies and chikdren from dying. With vaccination levels high here in the US we have enjoyed herd immunity. Of course thanks to vaccine those days are over and we now are getting Measles outbreaks again like its the fking 1800s. So yeah got chickenpox as a kid and it DOES NOT mean you are safe from getting it again however you ARE very likely to get SHINGLES from the virus as it does stay in your body FOREVER and gets reactivated when you are stressed or just with age. Getting chickenpox should be avoided. It has zero benefit and only risks complications down the road. Shingles is extremely painful and can blind you.
16149,Shingles vaccine: The first one of the two was pretty mild  but that second one was by far the worst shot I Have ever received
16150,: My motherinlaw had one pulled out about 2 years ago around Jan 2022 from her upper leggrointo other upper leg area that was about 2 feet long. The hospital told her it was from the shot she took 2 Pf shots. She said she is blessed to be alive. She was told she has to take blood thinner the rest of life. She sees a vein doctor about every 6 months or so now to check for more. cryingface
16152,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: This is wonderful news We are in the UK and my nowtoddler was part of the Harmonie Study to consider how strongly babies were protected from serious illness and hospitalisation after receiving the RSV antibodies. My oldest son was not so lucky and suffered greatly from RSV at 7 weeks old. He has had respiratory issues with hospitalisation ever since he is now 8 though I am hopeful that he is growing out of some of these issues. My youngest however has not had any serious illness to speak of despite also being in a childcare environment though much later than my first because of the UK's maternity leave policies which doubtlessly helped. I am so grateful that we were a part of the study group and I hope all families are spared the agony of a child suffering serious illness and lasting risk from RSV.
16153,Shingles vaccine experience: This. Most people suggest getting vaccines in your nondominant arm. But if it starts being a bit sore you just naturally do not move it as much and it gets worse. Get the shot in your dominant arm. Using it as you go about your normal routine helps prevent the soreness or at least helps it not to be as severe and you get over it faster.
16154,I got shingles because my shitty doctor did not say I should get vaccinated when I turned 50. After it cleared I got the vaccinations and the first one was okay but the second one was being hit by a train and my husband did not want to get it because he saw how hard it was on me
16161,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Same. I Am mid 50s and I Have had a very painful case of shingles twice I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I also had chickenpox as a kid. I also had the post herpetic neuralgia where the area that was affected aches and hurts years later from nerve damage. Its a horrible feeling. People that intentionally infect a baby are sadists. If that had happened to my baby and my husband acted that way the marriage would be over and no contact with the MIL either way.
16163,"2nd Shingles Shot: I got the first shingles shot a year ago, and was told to get the second in six months. With COVID, and another health problem to deal with, I missed the deadline. I asked the pharmacy if I needed to start over, or if getting the 2nd shot now will still give me full protection. They said they don't know. I asked my primary, who is a nurse practitioner, and he said he didn't know. The doctor in his office said he'd have to look into it. Does anyone here know the answer? Medical history: 60 yrs old, 200#, 5'10, have gout, CKD, HBP, and never had chicken pox, if that is relevant."
16164,Had breast cancer surgery three weeks ago and was finally starting to heal  although there is still some lingering nerve pain  when shingles got me a couple of days ago. It started right under the breast that was operated on then arose on my back. I did get the vaccine in '21 but stupid me forgot to get the second dose...really would like to go back in time and politely remind myself to do so I am taking acetaminophen for the surgery related pain and also for this but it does not help a lot. I get a deep achy lasting pain in my back that does not respond to much. I started valaciclovir yesterday and I use triamcinolone acetonide corticosteroid and lidocaine used in cancer treatment on the sores and calamine spray to staunch the itch and I sleep on cold compresses on my back but I would like to know if there is something else I can do? I do not have access to a bath so cannot do oatmeal. I am getting nervous because I am supposed to have radiation treatment coming up and I would like not to go through that  shingles. On the good side the surgery got all the cancer or however they say it I am ready to start healing.
16165,However unpleasant the sideeffects of the shingles vaccine might be I have had shingles and the pain of that goes on for at least a month. Once you have the 2nd shot you are protected. Wishing you a quick recovery from the sideeffects.
16166,Shingles vaccine: I put it off because the hospital was out of it when I first became eligible. Then I had shingles on my head. It was creeping toward my eye and that was terrifying. If it gets the retina it can leave you blind in that eye. Now I have whatever immunity you get from having shingles plus the two doses of vaccine. Get vaccinated people.
16168,i need help: it could be more likely to affect men and women in different ways as well. but i agree that nothing has felt off limits i would only feel bad if i were to over eat but i rarely feel compelled to over eat. the day after a shot i would sometimes feel some nausea but not enough to prevent me from eating.
16171,Was this really a thing?: I had chicken pox TWICE First time was a very mild case. Second time was a mess of spots everywhere and I mean everywhere. Eyelids inside ears and even on my bits and pieces Awful. Just awful. I also had shingles when I was pregnant. Very mild case. Hope that does not return the same way the chickenpox did.
16172,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: yeppp. i have several large scars on my face from chicken pox. and my sister and husband both have had shingles.
16174,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Who elses skull would it fracture?
16175,1Brain clot emergency surgery. Long recovery. 2Flu like Illness right after then died in the hospital unexpectedly. No reason given why 3shingles type rash all over face body for over a year. 2021 1 shot each. 1 lives in Norway 2 3 KY
16176,Shingles shot Ack: I got shingles on my face and surprisingly they did not hurt. Only problem was if it gets in your eyes you can go blind. I was in my 40s. The idea of getting the vaccine now is not exciting.
16177,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Getting chicken pox as an adult is miserable and dangerous. Both of my parents had somehow made it to adulthood without getting it so when I brought it home from preschool it brought down the whole household. What was a few days of fever and itch for my sister and me was a weeklong high fever inbed kind of illness for them. Prevaccine parents wanted their kids to get chicken pox young because its safer and easier than getting it as an adult.
16179,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: honestly my parents weren t around much so it definitely could be possible
16181,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Probably will not have the same reaction for the 2nd shot now that your body has seen it. But for now drink lots of water and take it as easy as you can. Ibuprofen ought to help and a cold washcloth cannot hurt.
16184,Got vaccine today: Thank you so much. I was shocked. when my little 3 dotted rash turned into full blown shingles overnight. Is vaccine the original vaccine? If so I got it 10 years ago. Got both doses of Shingrex 2 years ago.
16185,I have had 2 courses of antibiotics in the last 6 weeks one after a paramedic examined me at the GP practice and the other was the pharmacist because the nurse from the GP told me that they did not have appointments for the day despite me calling at 810 that morning yeah I know I should have called earlier and that procedure is to call first to the pharmacist for a throat infection really Two weeks later I feel ill again lymph nodes swollen pain and a mild rash. I got a call back 20 hours after filling out the 111 online form and they wanted to send me antibiotics again the thing is it would have been the third course of antibiotics in 6 weeks and I am allergic to penicillin and breastfeeding so my options are limited. In this day and age are Drs still prescribing antibiotics without doing any testing? By the way I pushed for a face to face appointment and it was shingles. When I explained my symptoms the nurse was not very convinced because I did not seem agonizing in pain and I said trust me I can function but I am in pain and when she had a look she said yup. It is that good thing I advocated for myself because antivirals work if given early. So if I did not know any better I would have been given yet another course of antibiotics which I am very limited in what I can get and it would probably compromise my immune system even more I am diabetic...
16186,Sorry for the novel but I have never met others who get it. Anyone else with old rods? I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was 10 in the summer of 1998. My grandma who had mild scoliosis herself had been taking me to swimming lessons and noticed that one of my shoulder blades stuck out more than the other. She took me to her orthopedist who took one look at my films and sent me straight to Shriners Hospital. Fortunately my hometown where I still live has a Shriners. I do not remember all the details anymoreI think my more significant curve was around 6570but the gist was that my curves were already too advanced for bracing surgery and spinal fusion were my only options. Surgery was set for the following June pretty much as soon as school got out so that I would have the whole summer to recover. In the interim I had regular visits at Shriners where they took more xrays ran countless blood tests and had me bank my own blood. It felt like an endless litany of tests and pokes to a 10 year old. Leading up to surgery I would lead a normal life and no one really prepared me for how debilitating and disorienting it was going to be. Not to mention the sensory nightmare. The first couple of days after surgery I mostly slept but they made me get out of bed and sit upright as soon as the first day post. It sucked. I do not remember a lot but every time they moved me it agitated my catheter and that burned. Shriners is incredible and they do all they can to make kids comfortable. After a few days I could sit for bits of time so they wheeled a Playstation the original lol into my room and my grandparents went and rented me the A Bugs Life game at Blockbuster. After a week's stay and some brief PT they sent me home. Life at home was rough. I barely had the strength to roll over in bed and I could not do stairs so I had to spend a while sleeping on a futon in my mom's home office. The hard pain meds I was on caused constipation. I was barely eating because the drugs suppressed my appetite so one day the doctors made me go cold turkey off of them and I endured a week of withdrawls as an 11 year old. And then I got shingles. I played so much Pokemon on the Game Boy that summer. I got a lot of presents from people who felt bad for me. When I was eventually able to visit friends again they treated me with kid gloves. I had no stamina so I had to use those motorized carts at the grocery store which led to strangers' dirty looks. All told it took me about a year to get back to normal or rather establish my new normal. It took a lot of trial and error though my school years to discover my limitations. Sometimes the pain was intense but as a teen I even held a job in fast food for two years. When I was 26 in 2014 I got pregnant with my oldest child. I had more frequent more intense pain during pregnancy. A support belt helped some. Due to the fusion T3L2 no one on my care team was sure if an epidural would work so in my third trimester I consulted with anesthesia. They basically shrugged and said it was up to whoever was on call when I was in labor so I did some googling. I read that it may work it may not it may work too well it may only work on half of my body... Given that I am an anxious person and could not predict what an epidural would do I moved forward with planning for an unmedicated birth and taking classes on doing so. In early 2015 I gave birth to a 9 lb 7 oz baby boy with a 15 head completely unmedicated. It had not been easy but I fucking did it and I have never felt a high like that before or since except the second time I had a baby unmedicated 4 years later. After having my baby the pain in my bad shoulder increased exponentially and I sought treatment. I received PT and some steroid shots in my shoulder the shots helped more than the PT. While I was a patient there the physical therapist told me that Harrington rods such as mine are rated for 25 years. I have never actually tried to verify that. Back in June my rods turned 25. I have not seen an ortho in a few years. This xray is 4 years old after I got in a high speed wreck and my attorney wanted to make sure my hardware was fine. I guess only time will tell if I will need additional surgeries. I live a relatively painfree life though it does not take much to set something off. I know my limitations and it has not been easy but I try to live within what my body can do even when sometimes that means missing out on activities. I invested in a hot tub during the pandemie and it is one of the best things I have ever bought. I also use cannabis medicinally.
16195,Shingles vaccine: Only reason I was glad to turn 50 was to get these shots. Although I feel really lucky I had no side effects except a soar arm for a day each time.
16202,ON got my RSV vaccine: Zero reaction to mine as well I think did not even hurt where I had it done. The other vaccine I had hurt though lmao
16204,"""Flu vaccine experience - seeking advice"": Hey everyone, I recently had a rough time after getting the flu vaccine. I've heard mixed reactions about it and I'm feeling hesitant about getting the shingles and pneumonia vaccines next. Has anyone else experienced any negative side effects from these vaccines? I'd appreciate any advice or personal stories you can share!"
16205,Rashes on body after seeing girlfriend: My son looked like this after a reaction to amoxicillin but I don't think it was itchy. Kind of looks like the mono rash (which is what they tested my son for first) but I also am not sure if that would be itchy. Definitely see doctor.
16207,Shingles vaccine: I got slightly weird feeling with arm pain both times. Having shingles is way worse.
16208,RSV vaccine: 36 and 2 days. I Have never had a shot reaction before I could not believe it lol
16209,First time shingles: My sympathies. You are about ready to embark on a nightmare. Shingles are horrific. The pain is indescribable. My severe pain lasted through Day 15 and then a miserable itching began on Day 16. 1. Did your doctor also prescribe Gabapentin? You will not make it without Gabapentin. 2. My doctor prescribed Hydroxyzine for the itching. In the worst times I took one at 2pm and also one at bedtime. The pill makes you sleepy but you want to sleep anyways. 3. Ice packs helped tremendously. My doctor also prescribed a pain pill. Sadly it only lasted for 2 hours of the 6 hours. 4. My children bought me some Aspercream Lidocaine spray. It helped me so much. The spray is so cold and it felt good to spray it on. If you have any more questions please text me. My heart goes out to you.
16210,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My fatigue lasted for about 2 days. I do know a couple of people that felt it for at least 3. Of course anything is better than shingles.
16211,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I live in the US on a 1.5 year wait for a doctor.
16212,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My sister got the vaccine as a kid and gets shingles every few months now.. she is 28
16213,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: ...while being hit with waves of high voltage. It is can be extremely unpleasant. Got a pretty good case last year natl immunity is good for 3yrs or so. Next year I will be getting the vaccine. Very strange I had pretty high levels of pain at random times long after the skin had completely cleared.
16214,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I have a question. Does the vaccine wear off? I was vaccinated in like kindergarten. But I got chicken pox when I was 18 or 19 and it was miserable.
16216,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I highly recommend the shingles vaccine to anyone who cam get it. I am 30 and had it in 2021 it is the worst pain that I have ever been in and I still have lingering issues from it that flair up every now and again.
16217,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: Thanks for the reminder that one can still get shingles even after the vaccine vaccines. What were your symptoms like?
16223,"42 yo male - hives after 2nd Johnson & Johnson shot: After getting my second Johnson & Johnson shot, I broke out in hives all over my body. It was incredibly itchy and frustrating to deal with for about three weeks. I even had to resist the urge to scratch in public! Despite the discomfort, I'm grateful that it wasn't a more serious reaction. And hey, at least I saved some money on not being able to hit the beach without a shirt on!"
16224,Second Shingles Shot: Same as soon as I could. And no side effects either. The second one left my arm a little more sore than the first one but that was it. And even that only lasted 24hrs.
16225,Not my baby: Before RSV vaccine was common one of my kids got it. Quickly turned into pneumonia and almost killed them. These folks can fuck right off.
16226,Anybody's baby get the RSV antibody treatment and then get RSV later? How did they do if so? I am super curious. My daughter had RSV at 6 weeks and spent three days in the hospital. She got the shot at her 3 or 4 month appointment. She is about to be 5 months. If she were to get it again she has two brothers that are germ factories I am just wondering if she will do better this time.
16227,"Surprising Commonality of the Virus that Causes Shingles: ChatGPT said: > According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 99% of adults in the United States who were born before 1980 have been infected with the Varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. This is because chickenpox used to be a very common childhood illness before the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995. > After a person has been infected with the Varicella-zoster virus, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system and can reactivate later in life, causing shingles. It is estimated that about 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their lifetime. The risk of developing shingles increases with age and with certain medical conditions that can weaken the immune system. > Vaccination with the chickenpox vaccine and the shingles vaccine can help to reduce the risk of infection and reactivation of the Varicella-zoster virus. The other thing that surprised me is that the virus that causes shingles is not the same as the one that causes cold sores."
16232,I can assure you Shingles is much worse. I took 2 Tylenol the morning of my first shot. Helped. Second shot I went commando. Was just fine. I never want to have a bad case of Shingles. Especially not in my eye. I have two aunts who almost lost their eye to Shingles. NOT good.
16233,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: Tomorrow will be a full 3 weeks since the rash appeared and the exhaustion is ruining my life right now. I am so constantly tired that the world is wobbly 
16234,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Had chickenpox as a kid just randomly. Shingles at 19. That led to post viral fatigue leading to an ME diagnosis. Fun times.
16239,I would not suggest that Shingrix vaccine to anyone they are injecting a LIVE VIRUS I started having outbreaks with shingles as early as my early 20s I Am currently 64 years of age I Have had outbreaks for over 40 years the shingrix vaccine increased my outbreaks
16240,What is this? Shingles?: I would say I was stressed these last couple of days. I went to urgent care and got anti viral. Last time I had it in 2022 it did effect my eye and made it funky but ophthalmologist said it was fine. This time I was aware quickly of the breakout and I got the medicine early and avoided picking the bumps and touching my eyes. Also she checked my eye and did not see anything Thanks you for input if these next couple of days my eye gets bad I will go to a doctor again.
16250,Shingles vaccine: I had no problems with mine. Really hope it works. I had Bells Palsy twice in the same year. Do Not need more of that viral trash.
16252,Ow I could not find vaccine and ended up with Moderna and it hurt as much as the Shingles vac. You will be hurting sorry
16259,I Have never had any kind of reaction to a vaccine. Not Covid. Not flu. Etc. but today I had the first dose of the shingles vaccine and Oof. Should come with a prepare to be hit by a truck warning.
16260,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Count your blessings! Out of all the shots I've had, this one is by far the worst"
16261,PSA Vaccinated? Yes you CAN still get shingles: Yeah my first outbreak after my vaccine was about a year later. Much much tamer outbreaks but yeah it sucks.
16262,Got the Shingles vaccine for Rinvoq-Heres what happened: Thank you so much for sharing! That makes me so excited!! So happy for you too!!
16268,Shingles vaccine: Got both of mine a few years ago. No worse than the flu shot. Shingles on the other hand is a sucky thing to have.
16271,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had no issues beyond a sore arm. I have seen what shingles does and I will take whatever side effect that comes with the shot
16272,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: COVID test is negative. Thanks for the suggestion for sure
16275,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: My spouse got shingles and Delta at the same time. So not awesome. He was only 45 and I Am def going to get the vaccine when I Am old enough
16279,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Glad she got Shingles. Unfortunately your daughter now may get it some day too and she would not have if your MIL did not deliberately infect her. This was a normal thing to do 50 years ago. Not any more. Also my SIL did it to her son 50 years ago and he had a bad reaction his kidneys shut down and he came very close to dying. MIL and husband are insane. You are a good mother keep that precious child safe.
16280,Second Shingles Shot: As a nurse I can say that its one that causes swelling and redness in a lot of people at the injection site but I Have never seen it last more than a few days.
16282,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes. I got it twice. First time was not bad. I had like 3 spots on me. Second time my mom put me in the bathtub with friends who had it. I got it so bad I had pox on the soles of my feet and palms over Christmas break. I got shingles at 41. Insurance will not cover the vaccine because I am not old enough.
16283,I have got the shingles: 36 here and was diagnosed this week and I am mind blown and in shock and very upset right now. I am having way too much pain. There is burning but the pain I am having is worse than the burning and itchy feeling.
16284,"Health PSA - Don't ride the day after breaking a fever: If you happen to get the pneumonia and shingles vaccine on the same day and react poorly to it such as running a fever all day with full body aches, maybe don't ride the next morning because you think your fever broke and you feel good. It's gonna be a bad day if you try that."
16291,RSV Vaccine Side Effects: Update  I did reach out to my OB when my fever got up to 101.4. But they said it was only concerning up to 104. I have been in bed literally all day so it has absolutely taken me out and napping on and off. I have not been awake for most of the day so it feels so the only thing I Am paying attention to now is fetal movement. I just have not felt her kick much but I have not been paying attention to it either between naps.
16292,Got diagnosed for shingles today :( I'm only 19: Hey don't feel alone! I got shingles when I was 19 too actually (21 now) but was around my waist. I'm one of the lucky ones without nerve pain with a tiny amount of scarring. Hope you're ok! C
16294,Got my Covid booster then 4 weeks later my flu shot. Other than a sore arm no issues. Will be getting the shingles vaccine next month.
16295,Shingles after Shingrix: I Am under 50. I just put the money aside and went to an independent pharmacy who cut me every discount they could cut me and they cut you a lot and got it early. FYI no doctor waits until they are 50 to get their vaccination. They pay out of pocket.
16296,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I got my 2nd just the other day and it is feeling pretty good. By tomorrow I should be right as rain so 4 days.
16300,"35[F] diagnosed 8 days after first AstraZeneca shot: Sharing my unexpected post-vaccine story. Shortly after receiving my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, I noticed a strange rash developing on my chest. The rash was itchy and seemed to be spreading rapidly, causing me a great deal of discomfort. After consulting with a dermatologist, it was determined that I had developed a rare skin reaction to the vaccine. I was prescribed a steroid cream to help alleviate the itching and inflammation, but the rash persisted for several days. The experience was both physically and emotionally challenging, as I had never encountered such a reaction before. Despite the setback, I am grateful for the protection the vaccine provides against COVID-19. Has anyone else experienced a similar skin reaction after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine?"
16302,Had the second shingles shot: I got shingles at age 39. Was pretty shocked as was the doc. Big ass sore right on my forehead. I guess it was a pretty mild case. If I remember right it was some steroids and Lyrica. I have not remembered there even is a vaccine. Probably ask next time I go see the doc.
16308,I am totally freaking out. I am a total hypochondriac. I obsess over being healthy. I eat all organic i exercise everyday i do yoga regularly for god sakes I have never even had smallpox or chickenpox before???? i hardly know what shingles is??? I am only 18???? apparently the vaccine i got for chicken pox as a child can because shingles later on in lifetold to me by my doctor. I had done a colon cleanse and my immune system dropped and now there is an itchy burning rash on my back. I am absolutely horrified. I am sensitive to light now too fatigued I am supposed to start a new job on monday i have a tattoo appointment that I have had scheduled for MONTHS on friday??? Thankfully my rash is rather mild I am def in the early stages. and I started meds less than 24 hours after it appeared. but even tho I am on the antivirals.. its still spreading? slower than it was but still. how long does this take to go away do the antivirals work???? what are they doing for me?? is this going to be a regular thing now????? i can hardly breath. someone pls give me reassurance. sorry if I am being over dramatic I am very uneducated and everything i read online is so scary.
16309,I am a 55 year old female 51 and about 175 pounds. I do not drink or smoke. I am prescribed levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and 600 mg gabapentin for restless leg syndrome. I also am prescribed 10 mg lisinopril for HTN. Last week I started having back and neck pain that was unbearable. I thought maybe I just had sore muscles from working at my desk all day. By late that evening the pain was unbearable and I could not sit still. The pain was over my entire back and neck area. It felt like I was bruised everywhere. No rash and no reason for the pain. I took OTC ibuprofen then Tylenol and it did nothing for the pain. I used muscle rub and then took a hot shower to get the muscle rub to work better and that also did not work. I finally fell asleep around 4 am and slept for about 3 hours. The pain was still there in the morning but it was all over now. My entire torso back neck scalp along my jaw and my legs but only above my knees. I am only in pain if something touches me or if I move. The pain is similar to shingles pain. A burning soreness just under my skin. I can lean back in a chair and have no pain when the chair touches my back but the movement of my clothes on my skin or a touch from anything is excruciating. I had my annual physical last Tuesday and everything was normal. I went to urgent care last Friday due to the pain and they did not have any answers and I was told to go to my regular doctor as soon as possible. My primary doctor ran labs again and added all kinds for vitamin deficiencies and other bloodwork and everything is normal other than slightly low sodium levels. I have no other symptoms and I cannot work and I cannot drive because the vibration of the car causes so much pain. I would also like to add I did have my shingles vaccine series completed earlier this year. I also had COVID19 in September and my cold symptoms finally went away about two weeks ago. Any ideas?
16310,Shingles and other Vaccines: I put off getting my shingles shot then got shingles. It was awful. I would get the shot because the side affects may stink but having it is worse
16311,Hi I Have looked some things up but honestly I Have had an exhausting couple of months with a lot of health things happening on top of that and appointments coming up. I was worried about vaccines with the incoming admin and decided to get my titers checked. I went ahead and got my TDAP because I was due for tetanus. The doctor only sent a script to check MMR and its come back that I have zero immunity. I Am not sure if this is because my parents are vaccine and lied about my infant vaccinations I do not have an official record and was homeschooled so I never had to have it checked. Or if this is because over time its common for immunity or at least antibodies to drop. Or I Am curious if a third thing is possiblecan someone be a nonresponder to most or all vaccines? I Am a HEP B non responder. I got the vaccine five times I eventually realized ended up in the hospital and could not remember my last HEP B vaccine date they told me I Am a nonresponder and gave me a huge dose of the vaccine and said Id be fine now. I have not checked it since. I got the HPV vaccine and several years later I was infected with a strain of HPV that I was vaccinated for. I cannot find any records of this happening to others though surely it has. So out of curiosity is it possible for someone to just not respond to vaccines well or at all? And if that could be the case should I have immunity for anything else checkedshould I even BOTHER getting more vaccines? I Have scheduled MMR and my doctor has a script for me to get Shingrix because I Have had shingles three times now and I Am in my thirties. But?
16312,Shingles vaccine: Same early 40s and I took the whole 11 weeks of fmla. It was really bad and exhausting and I wanted to rip my face off from the itching and burning.
16313,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I went to unintentional pox party. I Am a younger millennial and got the vaccine. A few weeks later I was at daycare and I remember a kid going home early. Then when we went home the teacher said we were all exposed to chicken pox. Every single kid in my class who was not vaccinated yet got it and I was the only one who was vaccinated and still got it. Unfortunately I gave it to my step dad and he ended up on the hospital for a day or two. Ironically I also gave him COVID during the pandemic that landed him in the hospital.
16314,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: but the hallmark sign of shingles is it runs along a nerve on only 1 side like mine was on 1 side of my upper back my under arm on that side and the breast on that side does not sound like you had shingles IMPORTANT addition in rare cases shingles can spread across both sides of the body a condition called disseminated shingles.This can be a medical emergency and requires immediate hospital attention
16316,How did you handle Shingles besides meds?: Mine was on my right side about that same spot. My tolerance is also very high but shingles was baaaad. I say this now as a 52 year old with end stage arthritis in both knees and a bulging disc in my spine at L5S1. This is why I was so excited to get the vaccine. Shingles was worse than both of those other issues.
16317,Shingles vaccine pharmacy recs?: I felt like I had the flu chills fever body aches.
16318,Shingles and other Vaccines: The shingles vaccine was the worse painful but worth not getting shingles
16323,Put me out of my misery.: Sorry that you are suffering but i admire your resolve to go through with the second shot. I actually had shingles 2 yrs ago almost exactly diagnosed on Xmas eve and I still have pain on the right side of my upper back. Hang tough you did the right thing and you WILL feel better
16325,I went to pick up some meds at CVS. They asked me if I wanted to get the flu vaccine shingles vaccine and COVID vaccine I asked at the same time? Is that ok? Pharmacist himself said its perfectly safe. This was yesterday. I have felt like shxt all day. Shoulda spread them out.
16328,Has anyone had the vaccine? How did it go? My mother 80 just had a bout of shingles and it was horrible for her. Would like to avoid something like that if possible I m generally onboard with established vaccines but because my mom s ancient rural doctor advised her against it thought I d get some opinions. TIA.
16330,Thought it was heat rash lol: I am dealing with this now. Had what I thought was hives from trying a new skin serum until it travelled from my forehead to my right eye. Even though I am 6 days out my doctor prescribed valacyclovir prednisone and ibuprofen yeah like that is going to help. Because I have a blister on my right eyelid and an infected eye I was sent to an ophthalmologist right away and he checked the pressure of my eye. He prescribed me prednisolone drops to take. I am in serious misery Had my first shingles outbreak back when I was 17 and now I am 52. I have to wait one year for the vaccine which stinks because if you have it in the eye they make you wait. I am sorry you are going thru this but just know you are not alone.
16337,"""Unexpected side effect? Numbness in my fingertips post-vaccination. The sensation is reminiscent of the tingling I experienced during my battle with shingles a few months ago. Could there be a connection between the vaccine and this neuropathy? Share your thoughts and experiences!"""
16345,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I have had shingles. Had to take antivirals. I have also had the shingles vaccines and I did it in my early 40 s.
16346,Paroxysms of burning pain: Wow Acreage having shingles several times sounds terrible. I was reading in pubmed more about zoster and there are some genetic variants that make some people more susceptible. I am happy to say I am on day 5 of no gabapentin and no more severe pain attacks. To me it felt like the gabapentin was suppressing the pain and storing it up somewhere until the dam burst and unleashed a bunch of gaba or some other Neurotransmitter or my sodium gated channels went crazy. Not an expert at all just like reading the research and trying to suss out what is going on. I do feel I am getting better day by day. Nights are the worse. Lidocaine patches 4 percent helpful for 1 or 2 hours. I take Excedrin pm with 25 mg of an antihistamine. I always end up back to using calamine lotion and cool compresses though. Happy to get sleep even if restless. I am back to driving and feeling confident. This time last week I was depressed because I felt like an invalid who would need to be driven to places. I cannot imagine how your friend drove during an attack. Thankful I am on the mend and sending hope to everyone dealing with this awful disease.
16348,: I was coerced and guilted by my family doctor to have the astrazeneca zeneca jabs because I was caring for my dad who was dying from terminal cancer and was told I HAD to have it or the NHS would stop carers visiting lunch times while I was at work... I am hoping the AZ jabs do not give these dodgy clots.
16349,Has anyone experienced a fever after receiving the flu shot? I did. Just curious if this is a common reaction. I'm in my 30s - my friend got the same flu shot and had no issues.
16353,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I had Shingles at 40 too It was EVIL Felt like I had bones made of glass shards and the fever my rash was not as bad as the other symptoms Got the shingles vaccine last year Do not Ever want to have that again Get Vaccinated You all
16358,25m white USA no preexisting conditions 61 160lbs. Got this rash under my thigh after experiencing a fever nausea vomiting sweating chills. Looser stool but no watery diarrhea. Its been changing the last few days but it started as bug bitey bump then shifted to flat almost hive like splotches now there gone down in swelling and the color seems to be darkerfading. Noticed I have the smallest amount of neck strainsoreness. I Am really freaking out. Urgent care said he thinks I have shingles but I was vaccinated. Any ideas? I need some peace of mind.
16359,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: My pain is actually pretty minimal now except for this frequent stinging in my eye. My issue now is almost entirely my eye and being able to open it fully and the stinging. I do have a bottle of gaba pent in but have not tried to take it for the eye. Other than a spot of rash and some numbness a few days ago my nose has been unaffected. Eta before I had a rash I had a terrible headache that was treated like a migraine and given a prescription for a migraine medication that did nothing. Thankfully the headache went away after 5 days.
16360,I am glad to hear you resisted their propaganda. I sometimes wish I had used reverse psychology on my mum pretend to be vaccine she might have not taken it if I said it was OK lol. She caught Shingles then took the shingles shot has not been right since.
16367,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: My fatigue lasted for about 2 days. I do know a couple of people that felt it for at least 3. Of course anything is better than shingles.
16368,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: I had shingles on my face this spring. Nothing crazy on my face antivirals fixed it. But like you I dealt for weeks and months with the most odd zaps zingers and nerve pain all over. Like my whole nerve system was fried. Really worried me. Its slowly and I mean slowly retreating. I attribute it to shingles.
16370,Shingles vaccine: second dose: My second shot was no problem compared to the first.
16371,Shingles vaccine: I got it on my face in my 30s. Everyone get the shingles vaccine.
16372,Fever cough and runny nose I feel horrible because I think he got it from me working in a preschool setting. I hate myself for not being carefulnot wearing a mask this time of the year I took him to the pediatrician and there was basically nothing I could do other than monitor his fever fluid intake number of diapers and breathing. How can I ease his discomfortpain? I read about hot steam showers and nasal sprays. Should I actually give him a bath or just use steam from running hot shower? Is there anything else? Also he got his RSV vaccination too I am so frustrated. Does anyone have experience with RSV even with vaccination? How were the symptoms? How long did they last?
16374,I just wanted to share my experience and a few tips for those who come on here looking for answers. Day 1 I had some stingingsoreness when I sat down and soreness in my hip. Day 2 When I was taking a shower I noticed the soreness again. I got a mirror and looked and I had a rash on my bottom. I have never had something like that before so I called my OBGYN because of location I preferred her and she diagnosed Shingles. I immediately started Valacyclovir 1000mg ultimately I am going to be taking it for 10 days but common duration is 7 days. I am feeling very tired. Taking NyQuil so I can sleep through the pain. Day 3 The rash started forming small blisters in some areas. I noticed a couple new spots of rash on my leg same side as the rash on my bottom. My leg the one with the rash started tingling like when it first wakes up from falling asleep and aching. I am still tired a lot and it hurts to walk. Still taking NyQuil. Doc says I can alternate higher dosages of Tylenol and Ibuprofen but I do not want to take all those pills so I am just sticking with NyQuil twice a day. Read that you are only supposed to eat a clean diet of basically vegetables some fruits and whole grains but not whole grain bread. I read to especially not eat sugar. You can search up the reasons for this. Basically it aggravates the Shingles if you eat all the other stuff. No coffee either tear. Day 4 The rash is stinging now and I am still having pain in my leg. I put a little vaseline on the rash and have been staying in bed. Tired. Ordered Lysine Maluka Honey to put on the spots because a nurse recommended it and medical boy shorts gauze like shorts to put on over the rash with honey on it. So far no itching. Foot feels swollen and hurts when I walk. Decided to buy some edibles with 5mg THC and 5mg CBD. Tried one it knocked me for a loop. Did not like that. Day 5 Staying in bed leg aches and had nerve pain all night. Woke up and took HALF an edible. That was ok. Still hurts to walk. Rash still burns. So far the rash seems dried up but is still there. Day 6 Rash is scabbing over and starting to burn. Noticed what seemed to be the beginning of a couple more spots. Day 7 Rash is really starting burn now. Doctor prescribed some pain meds and another week of antivirals. She told me to put Desitin cream on the areas that would come in contact with anything when using the restroom. Hoping the rash starts to disappear in the next couple of days. I heard it is 710 days for spots to heal once they appear. In summary  I caught mine early. The antiviral med seemed to work by the end of the second day I was taking it. The rash did not spread after the second day of meds. NyQuil seems to work well at night for me. I am just suffering through the nerve pain because it is bearable but my doctor did offer to call in Gabapentin if it got too painful. Keeping Vaseline on the wound in a light amount once a day did seem to help with the burningdry feeling. Calamine lotion also seemed to help a little except in the areas where I am supposed to use Desitin. I will try the honey also. Not sure how the prescription pain med will work yet as I just took the first dose 20 minutes ago.
16375,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember going to a friends house on purpose to get chicken pox. My brother sat in my lap when he had chicken pox. I never got it and eventually the vaccine came out and I received it.
16379,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: me too I was in my 30's. Since I had nerve damage prior things went from bad to agonising and stayed that way for a decade. sadly most have to pay out of pocket in you s. if under 50.
16380,I saw my doctor this morning about something else and she was like hey do you want your first shingles shot while you re here? Once I got realizing I am now eligible for the old folks vaccine I was like sure ok. C uz I know shingles really sucks and I don t want any part of that. Well. Let me give the rest of y all some advice. Don t get this damn thing in the morning. I have felt like absolute crap all day spacey tired weak stomach just not right at all. And my arm is seriously killing me. Not saying it s not still better than actual shingles just saying do it when you can take to the bed.
16381,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: I have very mild tinnitus and nothing has changed since I have gotten both shingles vaccines. However shingles will really F you up.
16382,Waiting for test results. In a 4 year relationship. Scared confused and really sad.: Totally will. Its a PCR for HSV 1 2 and shingles. I had three broken blisters when it was swabbed and I hope that would pick it up. If it comes back negative it will make zero sense nothing else matches the symptoms.
16383,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I have to older siblings and they did not get the vaccine but I did.
16385,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: oof that head thump was strong
16386,Both Shingrix shots were rough for me for a couple of days but I know someone who got shingles and it was AWFUL. Hang in there
16391,Shingles for Xmas  New Years.: I am new here and I have some similar problems A few things 1. How old are you? 2. Have you had the shingles vaccine? 3. Have you had the pneumonia vaccine? 4. Have you had a full immunology blood work up done? I am 42 F with Specified Antibody Deficiency diagnosed about a year ago. I have always been bronchitis and shingle prone but I ended up with bronchitis I could not shake last fall and shingles near my eyes. I did not know on what to do so I spoke to a geri tia tricia n friend of mine. I figured if anyone knew what to do she would. She said I should see an immunologist so I went to see an immunologist and internist that I already knew. My blood work came back with almost zero pneumonia t it ers and no other problems. I got the pneumonia and shingles vaccines and I have had some success. I have had less recurring respiratory infections. I have had nerve pain and a few occurrences of shingles on my face head mouth but none on my body. My pneumonia t it ers are hanging on post vaccine barely and for the moment.
16393,Shingles vaccine experience: I got encephalitis with auditory and visual hallucinations from chicken pox as a kid was hospitalized and had two suspected seizures afterwards too. I signed right up for the shingles vaccine.
16397,Not saying the C19 vaccine do change our DNA. Just peculiar that vaccine blood was not given to general population. I am not vaccine however I am still recovering from a Shingrix vaccine 7 months ago.
16398,I need to schedule my flu vaccine. And my shingles vaccine. And my Covid vaccine. And a tetanus shot because why not? All in my right arm. Damn you lymphedema Damn you
16399,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I never had chickenpox either, had to get the chickenpox vaccine in my 20s before I got pregnant. I got my first Shingrix shot a few days ago and it knocked me on my a** for 2 days. Hoping the booster will be easier!"
16407,My friend took the shingles vaccine got shingles and then sent a message to everyone saying how this showed the importance of us all getting our shingles jabs
16410,Funny someone else just posted he got the first dose of shingles vaccine and said it hit him like a Mac truck. He said he was fine with covidflu vaccine so was not prepared.
16416,Finally out of my flare loving rinvoq more than I should as it is not a human being and BOOM SHINGLES.: I was 18 and got my shingles vaccine before starting rinvoq
16417,Shingles vaccine: Before there was Shingrix there was vaccine It was only 55 effective. I got shingles anyway on my face. I lost 50 of my hearing in my left ear. Then Shingrix came out. I have had both shots. No side effects. I highly recommend it.
16418,Vaccine Schedule: My girl has a Family Medicine doctor who was ok with delayed schedule. For multiple reasons including my own vaccine reactions in childhood her delayed growth explored chromosome issues and my anaphylaxis to C19 vaccine while pregnant with her. Family Medicine was understanding but two pediatrician offices I interviewed with were not. Some even have that on their websites.
16420,This week can be over now: Thank you. Unfortunately the shingles are on mom's face. I went back through the pictures from mother's day to see if she had any symptoms that I could see and she did. Due to the cancer she often has skin stuff so I did not think much of it at the time. One of the pictures is literally my baby's hand on her face right next to her eye where the shingles are. Chicken pox is not a huge big deal. It was just like the last thing my brain could wrap itself around tonight. Tomorrow will be a new day
16421,Shingles vaccine experience: You can get the shingles vaccine do Shingrex its more effective under 50 but you might have to pay out of pocket. I believe Costco has it the cheapest but you should call around and verify. Also I can confirm shingles is horrific. I was one of those people who got it around their eye and I was sweating it for a little while there. The pain is horrible. Nothing can touch the skin where the shingles are  it hurts too much. Even a breeze of air is painful. Its wild.
16424,Had shingles 3 times...had enough...getting vaccinated....: I am a medical mystery and they are fascinated by me. Everytime they taper me down I get shingles again. Anything under 1 gm and boom eye herpes. I was also diagnosed with Specific Antibody Deficiency Respiratory as they were running labs. Basically my body does not make antibodies for respiratory infections even when they give me a vaccine like vaccine So I also take regular high dose antibiotics. Plus I got lyrica for pain liquid amitriptylinegabapentin for topical use and prilosec because all the meds give me acid reflux. Oh and zoloft because all the above made my depression and anxiety worse Sorry to hear about your MS my infectious disease doc asked me a lot about MS symptoms and Family history around it not sure if there are other links besides the med?. MS is no joke and shingles on top is double woof. Hope you can get the shingles sorted without messing with the MS. Also DAMN that is a tough vaccine reaction
16426,Put me out of my misery.: That second shingles shot is rough. Better than shingles though. Be thankful for modern medicine lol
16429,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: I Am curious as to why you did not get the 2nd dose. Shingrix is a dead virus. I got it with active shingles and my doctor said it was fine as did the pharmacist. Their response was were not going to make it worse. And since that time knocks on all the wood no outbreaks.
16431,First Time Head and Neck Only: So so sorry. My first outbreak was a week old before I figured out it was shingles since the rash was under my hair and I just thought I had some godawful headache. It took a puffy eye to get me to think shinglesI would never known anybody who had it. Of course it was a weekend when I finally got the message so I did the same as youemergency room then box store pharmacy who had just sold out of valacyclovir. I feel your pain. I hope the antivirals kick shingles butt once you got them. FYI I now keep a filled prescription at home to avoid that delay in the future multiple shingles outbreaks since that first experience. Take care of yourself.
16434,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: My second dose was easier than the first.
16435,I guess well just ignore all the infants who pass away from RSV every year: I was so happy I was able to get the RSV shot for my baby I wanted to get it when I was pregnant there is also a version for pregnant women but you have to be 32 weeks at a specific time of the year but I missed the cutoff by a month. Our pediatrician was happy that I asked about it too she said the number one reason they send babies to the hospital is RSV and they were trying to get as many babies to take it as possible
16439,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: Yep my left eye is permanently damaged from shingles six years ago. The pain and the debilitating effects on my vision caused enough problems to upend my whole life and I am still trying to catch back up.
16440,I Am level 24 and I Am pretty close to reaching 25. Back in April I was just playing as usual when I suddenly got a notification that my character randomly got the shingles debuff on the face around the eye. My character basically became unplayable for two months. Fortunately my guild leader was able to carry me and got my character to another guilds healer before the debuff got me a game over. Apparently this debuff is normally locked to players level 50 and higher. Because I was so underleveled for it I now have seemingly permanent scar nerve pain and photophobia debuffs. I think it even messed up my graphics card as it reduced my render distance by 20. Has anyone else had this debuff before level 50? For anyone who has not I recommend getting the shingles vaccine item as soon as possible.
16442,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: The second shot felt like a tetanus shot. My arm hurt for 2 days but if I do not get Shingles its worth it. I worked with a lady when I was in my 20s that had it on her scalp. She was in so much pain and felt so bad for her.
16443,Rashes on body after seeing girlfriend: BTW I had shingles at 48 and I am not old people. I took meds immediately and the area was the size of an apple. But it HURT ached burned total misery. there is a vaccine for shingles nowadays HerpesZoster GSK two doses and I made my parents take it and will take it myself must wait 6 months after occurrence. it is well worth it. That pain never more.
16448,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Count your blessings. Yes, the sheet says I got Shingrex. I didn't even mention the sore arm or fever because that's pretty typical. But the awful and unrelenting headache caught me off guard."
16449,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My parents did the same thing. Kids across the street got chicken pocks she had them over and we shared popsicles. My sisters and I were sporting spots the next day. I was not a big deal none of us got any sicker than just itching. Then shortly after the start of the Covid lockdowns I had my first shingles outbreak. The whole right half of my face was coved in pus filled boils. They were on my eyelid and so swollen I could not see out of that side. It was super painful and left me with some bad scarring on my face. Six months later I had another outbreak right when I was starting a new job. Was Not nearly as bad though this time it stayed mainly on the lower half of my face and since we were all wearing masks anyways it was easy to cover that nastiness up.
16452,Had the second shingles shot: Second shot hit harder than the first for me.
16454,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My husband's mom kept him rather isolated as a young child do he did not get chicken pox before kindergarten like most kids in his area at the time. He is 49. There were no vaccines for varicellaat the time. He came down with chicken pox in his first week at college and had to leave school until it cleared up. The doctors were worried that it would because nerve or skin damage because he was older 18 but luckily it acted like normal for a kid because his body had not developed enough yet. He just has one little scar over his right eyebrow which exactly mirrors the one I have once my left eyebrow from my chicken pox when I was 4.
16457,: I am weeping for my estranged children who willingly received the vaccine and condemned us for not wanting to get it. This is horrific.
16462,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Speaking as a person who never contracted chickenpox as a kid and had to be vaccinated against chickenpox as an adult before pregnancy you should reconsider your stance here. I share the Gen X bravado but some things are not worth the price. Stay home until you are no longer infectious.
16464,Its a cover for shingles caused by said vaccine
16465,My wife 63F 5' 3 approx 240 pounds and Caucasian located in Oregon. We have 2 dogs greyhounds and a very fluffy cat who is always laying on her lap despite our best efforts the dogs tend to be on the floor on their very fluffy beds. The issue My spouse has been coughing pretty constantly since about midJanuary. she is been to urgent care 1x virtual care and in contact with her PCP without any current resolution or reduction of symptoms. The coughing is pretty much all day every hour. It impacts her sleep and in turn mine. She is also wheezing to the point that I can hear it in bed and on the couch. she is had a pulmonary function test which came back normal to rule inout COPD or asthma. she is never smoked anything at all in her lifespan including cigarettes or marijuana however her parents were heavy smokers and her family smokes which we are not around regularly or live geographically near. we have were doing so well in increasing movement to help with weight loss and in turn future knee replacement but is now even struggling with stairs in the home even with the below mentioned inhalers that all movement has effectively stopped. Our home has stairs and it looks like we will need to move to move into a home without stairs to increase her comfort we rent. she is so miserable as am I. x200B Ongoing current meds Amlodipine 10mg Solifenacin 5mg Meloxicam PRN for arthritis pain management Recent meds to troubleshoot coughing Albuterol 108mg Alvesco 160mg Various allergy meds including Zrytec Benadryl and Claritin but has not historically had a problem with allergies OTC Fish Oil Omeprazole Tylenol PM for overnight pain management Ibuprofen for day time pain management she knows when to alternate Meloxicam and Ibuprofen Etc Approx 2xmonth alcohol beverage typically two Miller beers each episode Appox 2xweek weed gummy only no smoking at all All vaccines current including COVID flu and RSV multiple COVID home tests have been negative
16466,Spouse got Shingles wneuropathy despite both Shingrix vaccine right after contracting COVID about 6 months after COVID Pfizer inoculations. COVID andor mandatory COVID shots wreak havoc with immune system
16470,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My baby got hers in the hospital two days after she was born before we got discharged. She did not even cry it was so quick. And afterwards we did not really notice any side effects. Her schedule seemed about the same and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
16471,Shingles? Rinvoq? Pain before rash after Covid booster: Definitely wise to time for side effects My rheumatologist has me time them so that I am halfway between my monthly injections and then I hold the shot for an extra week depending on how my immune response looks. I have an atypical presentation where I have joint damage in both central and peripheral joints. Mine is present in the sternoclavicular joints cervical and thoracic spine SI joints hips fingers and toes. I have found that the lines on my tattoos get raised and my very few psoriatic patches flare up a few weeks before my joints do so we have found the best timing to dose prednisone tapers to keep flares from getting too very bad. I am glad you are feeling better and I hope your holiday is amazing
16475,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got shingles on my neck a couple of months ago at 32 years old. I caught it really early and it cleared up within 2 weeks and I am still having shooting nerve sensations in my scalp and ear canal. It is awful. The worst pain I had during the breakout was this electric shock that I would get deep inside my upper back behind the shoulder blade. It was not as excruciating as I have heard some people describe so I think I got lucky. I wish I could get the vaccine but even next year at 33 they will just tell me I am too young to even get shingles. Sigh.
16476,RSV shot: My baby got the rsv shot every month and it is safe but also its totally reasonable to be upset about lack of consent and the vomiting. Our medical team filled us in everyday on everything they were doing and asked for our input.
16477,Shingles vaccine: I had a minor case of shingles when I was 42. A rash about 2 inches across.. It hurt like HELL and pain shot up and down the nerves it was in...
16479,41 and got Shingles: I got hand foot and mouth from my kid a couple of years ago and it was awful. Much like shingles it will take any weakness in your skin and make it into something terrible. Min should have been called beard scalp and mouth disease.
16480,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had shingles and all they did was itch. I did not really have any pain. I was surprised though that I was given the ok to continue to work. This happened around 2007 ish so I was about 30 31.
16481,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I had shingles. I thought I was going to die. I was out of work for a month. I still have ghost flares. GET THE VACCINE
16482,PSA get your shingles vaccine.: I had zero problems with the second shot just like the first. Go get it.
16483,I just got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.: That second shingles shot is rough Do it on a Friday.
16484,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Yeah I had a little patch on my back got to the doc got the antivirals and started them immediately and the VERY NEXT DAY one whole half of my back and part of the other had started turning red like it was going to break out all over but the antivirals knocked it back and kept it down to that one little spot. They really do the trick That spot drove me absolutely BONKERS for a month and a half I do not want to imagine what it would be like if it were worse.
16485,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Me too I have three pox scars in a triangle in the middle of my forehead.
16486,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the vaccine just when it came out 1996 now I am terrified of getting it as an adult since the vaccine has probably worn off in the last 28 years
16487,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: It was the worst vaccine I have had. I would advise scheduling it when you have a couple days off. Also from what I have heard the alternativegetting shinglesis TERRIBLE. One girl I knew had it in her freaking eye. I would rather be down a couple days than deal with that
16488,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: We got the antibodies for our baby as it was still newly approved for pregnant women in 2023 and my husband and I both got so sick when she was born and she is never been sick So we are thankful for this
16493,I am an active 56 year old. I eat pretty well not overweight not sedentary at the gym 56 mornings per week. I have been nursing a congestive thing runny nose sinus inflammation and cough for about 2 weeks. Woke up on Monday with a bloodshot eye as if i had scratched it in my sleep and wondered if it was something more. General loss of energy. I took a COVID test on a whim and surprise its positive. Very mild symptoms so I figure well ok I will weather this its probably at the end anyway since I Have had this sinus thing for almost 2wks. But on Wednesday night I noticed it felt like someone had bludgeoned me with a broom handle in the ribs on my right side. Very painful inner stabbing ache hard to sleep. I initially thought it was stomach cramps but determined it was probably body aches from the COVID. Then I noticed a small rash forming over where the pain was. Two or 3 days later here I am with what is clearly shingles still somewhat mild and the pain has subsided a lot and is more of a discomfort than anything. Hoping this rash does not turn into something worse. No visible pustules but super sensitive feels like a raw wound. Took a COVID test this morning and its negative. My eye has also cleared up completely. I was worried that it was part of the shingles but if it was it seems to have cleared up in that part of my anatomy. I am getting the shingles vaccine from now on. This sucks. I had the chicken pox as a kid in the 70s. I remember that being pretty mild too a few blisters here and there compared to friends of mine that had it bad. Maybe I have got some kind of natural resistance to it.
16494,Shingles with PHN after: I am so sorry. I fear the PHN more than anything else. I am about 11 days out from the rash that showed up above my eye. Mine is so small compared to others' I have seen. But holy shit. The pain. My pain is in my templeear canal and it feels like someone is trying to unalive you with a butter knife. When my throbbing is active like up to 10 15 of these attacks per minute. It is been brutal. I am only 48 so I have not been vaccine and cannot be for another 1.2 years.
16496,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: I would fully believe the RSV vaccine made a difference for my daughter. Both my kids are in daycare 2.5 son 6.5mon daughter. My son got RSV from daycare really bad in December 2023 when he was about 17 months and ended up in the PICU for a few days on high flow oxygen. I have been a nervous wreck about my daughter getting it. I was not able to get the vaccine while pregnant so I made sure she got it as soon as she was able. She got the RSV vaccine at her 4month appointment. This past week my son caught RSV again just not as bad as in 2023. He was sick for about a week fever shallowrapid breathing cough etc. I took him the ER one night because his fever skyrocketed and he was having a lot of belly breathing and retractions. My daughter has stayed relatively healthy. She may have caught a really mild version because she had a bit of a cough and some congestion. And he brother kept stealing her paci and giving her kisses so she definitely got exposed . But over all this round of RSV was SO MUCH EASIER than the first round.
16497,I am extremely stressed out due to life haha and now even more because what ifs its bug bites so now i am freaking out even more but i question if it even is bug bites because i have a baby laying next to me with absolutely nothing. but almost every body part it pops up on it then pops up on the other like both elbows sides on torso but there are few that are not mirroring each other but the majority is. The only new thing I Have done recently is get the 1st round of the hpv vaccine like 2 weeks ago. I Have only had two occasions of hives my entire life not including now which happened after swimming two completely different pools and I was covered from neck to toes. I believe those incidents are due to high chlorine or something of that nature because anytime I Have taken a shower my legs get red and splotchy but no welts like what is going on now and those two other instances. Also yes my legs are hairy please ignore that
16499,Getting my first Shingles shot today: First one had no sides. Second floored me.
16501,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did. It was not a party some family friends of ours got the virus in their house and I went and played with the girl that was my same age whom I also played with on a regular basis. This actually was recommended by my pediatrician as it was a more controlled way to get the virus and get it out of the way. I will not be taking the vaccine as I Am immuno compromised and I do not react well to a lot of those treatments. I had a very rare auto immune disorder years after exposure to the chickenpox that had nothing to do with chickenpox they actually still do not know how you get it juvenile dermatomyositis I think these parties are definitely a case of parents making health decisions based on best information available at the time.
16503,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I think it depends on the shingles case. Even though my shingles was awful your sepsis sounds more painful and difficult. Glad you are still around and I hope you do not have any reoccurrence.
16507,I recently been diagnosed with shingles I thought it was heat rash at first or a bad spider bite. It started Monday I waited until Friday hoping to see if the pain goes away or the rash resides. When I got to physician on Friday she automatically knew it was shingles and got me on acyclovir. Its my 2nd day on it and the pain sucks but bearable. I Am more worried about my tattoo I just got done recently which healed a couple months back. The rashes are located on my left shoulder blade and towards my spine.
16509,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles s few years back. It is incredibly painful and that pain is prolonged over a long period of time 2 weeks in my case. My face is also permanently scarred from the disease. I was lucky because I had a fairly mild case of shingles. Trust me whatever pain you might or might not get from the vaccine is infinitely better than getting shingles.
16510,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: I let it go the first time for 23 days. Luckily it was on my chest not my head. Took over a year for the lightning to stop shooting down my arm. Luckily being young it healed up. Since then I would call my doctor and they would just call me in a script. It did help me identify it in a coworker who got it on the side of his head. Might have gotten into his eye had I not told him to go to the doctor and pharmacy immediately and do not wait to take the meds. So that was a nice side effect of getting it. Have not had it in almost a decade now knock on wood but I will never forget that feeling.
16513,Following my hpv journey: During the colonoscopy they did not remove any warts for a biopsy. I assume that when I undergo surgery to remove the warts inside my rectum with a surgeon they will take a biopsy then. Yes I received the first two doses and in February will take the third one. After getting vaccinated I noticed a slight improvementnot going to lie. The wart growth has slowed down significantly and is not as extensive. My main concern now is to completely remove the rectalanus warts and prevent them from recurring. After my third dose Ill do an HPV PCR test to determine which strains I have. Hopefully its not any of the highrisk ones.
16517,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: It did not. I was born in 83 and never got chicken pox ever. Despite my moms best efforts too when my younger sister got it when we were small kids and again while on a 5th grade field trip and one of my good friends broke out. By the time I started college in 2001 the vaccine was out and I got the shot as a requirement for being in the dorms.
16518,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Yep I got shingles at 30. A mild case but it was truly awful.
16519,And my old ex door neighbour got the shingles vaccine and she got shingles after taking it she was Annoyed big time. So it sounds like none of these jabs do Fall
16522,Shingles shot: No high fever and terrible body aches. Only last 24 hours but not fun.
16525,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I had it near my ear internally which completely messed up my hearing on that side for a week before I became paralyzed. It was not Bells palsy it was Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Its a rare form of shingles. I got it at 33 I did get vaccined
16527,Shingles vaccine?: I had it for the same reasons. Had a small allergic reaction to it. Now its part of my allergens list.
16536,Because of shingles other than stress?: Are you vaccinated? My Hubby was on immunosuppressive therapy for a Kidney Disease and when he got Shingles they spread to his Spine at C4  C5. Known as Disseminated Shingles. It only makes up 2 of Shingles cases but makes up 30  50 of cases in ImmunosuppressedImmunocompromised people. He spent 2 months in the Hospital and has right side paralysis similar to a Stroke. He was vaccinated. So as horrible as it was it could have been worse. I strongly suggest the Vaccine if you are Immunosuppressed andor Immunocompromised. Stay well friend
16539,32f 5'7 taking leflunomide hydroxychloroquine bupropion buspirone trazodone more meds listed below. I have been to see two doctors for these bumps on my neck. Timeline is day 1 left shoulder pain and small red bumps under my left clavicle. Day 3 5 small red bumps on left side of my neck. Day 4 headache. Day 57 razor sharp pain across the bumps on my neck and under my clavicle. Today is day 8 and the razor sharp pain feels like is through my clavicle and muscles around it. The rash on my neck feels like something is bubbling from under my skin. However the rash has not formed clear blisters. The thing is the doctors just say rash. I have had extreme stress looking for bed bugs in my house but not a single sign and no one else has bites in my house. No more bumps have appeared outside of this area doctor said in dermatome 5. I am on two antibiotics doxycycline and cefadroxil as well as valocyclovir only a couple doses in. I am still in terrible pain and frustrated I have been even more stressed at the thought of having pests in my house. I am very careful about cleanliness and do not stay in hotelstravel. Can shingles present like this? I am seeing a dermatologist but it is a virtual visit and afraid I will not get answers again.
16542,Dr. Peter McCullough A Lethal quotTurbo Cancerquot Appearing Soon After mRNA Vaccination Ask Dr. Drew: From anecdotal evidence it appears turbo cancer appearing soon after mRNA vaccination is real thing as two of my workmates have siblings who have died of turbo cancer soon after receiving their COVID boosters. They went from high functioning workers with active recreational life styles to dead in a matter of a couple of months.
16544,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I felt shitty from it but I Am sure it was not as bad as shingles
16546,Never had chicken pox but still got shingles?: At the start of the year I broke out in apparently the shingles across my cheekbone near my eye went to the hospital because I had no idea what was going on I had a pain jaw pain it was pretty severe. To find out that it was shingles and me and my mum were absolutely shocked because I Have never had chickenpox in my whole entire life and was vaccinated against it as a child but the only thing we can think of was that my sister had chickenpox and I must have caught the virus off her even though I never showed any signs or symptoms and it finally broke out in my adulthood life.
16553,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the chicken pox when about half my class got them in 1989. I got shingles when I was 43 years old and it was horrible. It was mostly just on the left side of my face and head. I felt horrible and had a permanent headache and sores all on my face. I was in shock when the doctor told me I had shingles when I went to the emergency room. I got antiviral meds to stop the spread it was all around my eye and I got a couple of thorough eye exam to make sure it did not spread to my eye. I was lucky it did not get my eye and I did not get any facial scars.
16554,The shingles vaccine helps your body's immune system build up a solid defense against shingles so you may experience temporary side effects after getting the shots. These side effects may include Pain or soreness at the injection site. Redness or swelling at the injection site
16565,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I was an idiot and got the shingles shot a flu shot and a COVID booster on the same day. I had to call in sick the next day. Not recommended.
16566,Some Singapore doctors see more patients with shingles over past 2 years: well i had shingles when I was 17 and the pain made me want to put bullets thru my brain.
16567,Shingles vaccine: Last year I got the covid booster and the shingles vaccine in the same visit. Did not feel sick at all afterwards.
16569,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 96 got the vaccine and also caught the pox in 1st grade. But it was so mild compared to what my mom said they were like for her when she was a kid. I got some red splotches and a mild fever for a day. No blisters or puss. If i have kids I will definitely vaccinate them because it could have been so much worse.
16572,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: There's a specific vaccine for chicken pox"
16576,My bro who is fully vaccinated had it at least 6 times. Now has shingles and is getting vaccinated for that too.
16580,I have always been randomly affected by vaccines. The weird thing is that sometimes I do not have SE's. I had started taking benadryl prior to getting the Mrna and I would say that definitely helped.I do not like meds so did not take it prior to the shingles vaccine
16582,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Nope I picked it up at school. I gave it to my dad though which is maybe the opposite of what you are talking about. It made him completely miserable. He looked like a dying lizard. Shingles also sucked so maybe he got his revenge.
16583,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yea happened to me. Got shingles from stress due to residency. Shit felt like someone was ironing my side
16586,here is to ya bastards my loyal crew Taking Shingrix having had GuillainBarre I bid you adieu See ya on the other side: No problems with the Flu vaccine but I have to have the old skool flu vaccine no more mRNA vaccines for me due to the risk of a GB S relapse.
16587,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: I had a coworker with shingles. He was the toughest guy I've ever met, but shingles did him in. He left work in tears more than once. Anything that could take this man down is nothing I want to mess with."
16588,"Shingles 3 weeks after 1st Pfizer Covid Vaccine: I'm a healthy 28 year old male. I'm also a staunch supporter that everyone get vaccinated, but I feel a little disheartened by the ""fact-checking"" of shingles being a side effect of the mRNA vaccines weakening the immune system. 3 weeks after my first dose, I got a rash on my right thigh. We assumed it was an allergic reaction to some chemical (I've gotten them before). 2 days later I received my second dose. The next day I contacted my PCP about the rash because it started to blister and learned it was shingles on my leg and because it was on day 4, antivirals would be useless. I'm now on day 9 of Shingles on my L2 dermatone and more red spots are appearing wrapped around my leg along the dermatone. I guess it's rare to be in this location, never mind on a 28 year old. I guess does anyone have any tips for stopping the continuing of outbreaks? It's already been 5 days of blisters, and I'm not looking forward to more popping up wrapped around my leg. The blisters have been when the pain/ burning starts. Also learned not to watch a scary movie, because the jump scares with a rush of adrenaline, feels like a knife is stabbing my leg. I've tried Benadryl, calamine spray, benzocaine spray, witch hazel, hydrocortisone, cold compresses, & wrapping at night while airing during the day."
16591,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom had us get the vaccine right at the early stages of development. I never got chicken pox but I DID get shingles as a 7 year old after it So sometimes the shit just gets you one way or another
16594,Anyone considered travelling to the US while pregnant to get the RSV vaccine? on: My baby was in the nicu in alberta for a week after birth. She was given the RSV vaccine within 24 hours of her birth.
16599,I had the same reaction and I do not get reactions to vaccines as well. But it was not as bad as the fire burning in my armpit when I had shingles so I prefer the vaccine.
16600,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I got my shots the week I turned 50. I Am not messing with that shit after seeing relatives get it. Let me tell you the Covid vaccine was easy after I had done those They hurt and you feel shitty for like 36 hours. But its worth it.
16601,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Do yourself a favor get the shots. My wife was officially diagnosed today with shingles. It started with about a half dozen red splotches on Sunday. Did Not think anything of it at the time but now she has excruciating pain on her left shoulder and down her arm. Get the shots.
16603,My brotherinlaw had never had shingles before but took the vaccine not because it was recommended. He then came down with a horrible bout that knocked him out completely for a couple of months still not fully recovered.
16607,I made a post before but noticed the bald spot looks really bad and did not show that so redoing. This is a very long post as I am chronically ill and will describe my meds diagnosis as well as family members who have issues. I am desperate and do not know how much longer I can stand this itching as it is been a few months now. If you read and have adviceknow what it could be I appreciate you. My scalp has never itched before. I have been itching for months and now turning bald and I am quite desperate for help. My itch is driving my sensory issues nuts and I have an unusal sensory response they said on my report. I went to allergist almost 2 years ago and this was for regular rashes as I have taken Zyrtec and Claritin back and forth daily for years. I recently switched back to Claritin like a week ago. I also take Flonase for chronic rhinitis and Mucinex max extended release daily for chronic sinus infections. Neuro suspects bronchiectasis. The allergist did patch test and I was allergic to dust mites. She told me when I came again with worsening rashes a couple months ago that I need to go to the dermatologist and get patch tested there for my concerns about skincare. Fast forward about 2 months ago perhaps I am bad at time due to asd and the issue has started on my scalp. No matter what it hurt. I tried everything and have spent hundreds of dollars. I even scoured through tj Maxx for hours reading every ingredient shampoo. I switched my laundry detergent to seventh generation from ecos and this helped those body rashes almost disappear with using an organic bar soap ingredients peppermint oil rosemary oil olive oil palm oil sodium chloride and glycerin. With that combination fragrance free lotion with the colloidal oatmeal I have now almost completely eliminated the body rashes. This is the tricky part. The scalp is only getting worse. I did switch to a coconut free shampoo and conditioner called clean kids on amazon. It has helped more than anything but alas the rash and baldness and that intense itching are not letting up. I try to palm at it which helps some. I use cold water. I have tried everything and every cream. All range from does not help to severe reaction. Triamcinolone cream stopped working I only used for hand eczema before and when given for scalp it caused a severe reaction which actually rendered it hard to breathe for me. I assume it is the propylene glycol. My sister Kat who shares the pots bicuspid aortic valve same tooth pushed back myopia ADHD migraines gerd bladder issues etc did patch test at derm and is allergic to propylene glycol coconut pineapple red food dye and something else I forgot. I use crystal deodorant now which works really good. I am also sensitive to yellow dye badly blue dye most of the time and not sure about red but do not think I am. Sensitive to and I feel I should mention I have severe gastroparesis chrons disease esophagitis chronic gastritis gerd again erosions now peptic ulcers internal hemmorids dyssynergic defecation history of a flat colon polyp pelvic prolapse etc. but sensitive to Gluten eggs cashews possible almonds and dairy propylene glycol as mentioned coconut and all its derivitives started with food and drink and turned into skin and cocomidopropyl betaine is the worst castor oil lavender oil sweet peas rapeseed oil baking soda and possible tea tree oil. Possible aloe vera which is in the clean kids shampoo. Derm was really mean to me and said they do not know what to do and said they would show me the door. They said patch tests in dermatology are rare. Asked if I was ripping my hair out I am not? Itch sometimes but try not to Getting a second opinion having doctor refer to family dermatologist who did diagnose my son with spitz nevus PCP though melanoma but derm said something xuanthogram I have no idea would have to find it I apologize but benign and spitz nevus which we now see is most likely. My whole family including my 3 children who are also asdADHD or AuDHD like me have eczema. Sister Kat again as mentioned I have 3 younger sisters has ketopillaris and adult acne as well. I have been told all my life I have thick hair I also am wondering if I have more than one hair on the follicles. I was not diagnosed with all these conditions until narcolepsy with cataplexy and cervical dystonia and hemiplegic migraines showed up at 25 getting serious. I like answers so I went to doctors and saw specialists which I had never seen before. I do like to shower daily due to sensory issues and have tried every other day with not much help flakes would appear and little yellow things which I thought could have been serrorhbic dermatitis. My scalp is also very oily and dry at times so it is very confusing. I switched to a new toothpaste that does not have baking soda or dye and it has significantly almost just vanished my mouth ulcers which would occur all in my mouth and on my tongue. Happened several times a month for a year or more although I would tend to get since childhood every here and there and was miserable. I do not dye my hair and I do not go out in the sun. I am a natural red head and have very fair sensitive skin. I always get bit by bugs and sunburnt and I prefer my alone time indoors. I live in the state of Arkansas. My mother and Granny also have bald patches that itch. My mother's PCP did not send her to derm. They said it was shingles at first then switched to swollen lymph nodes on her scalp. I have tried nizoral and not sure if the actual product or irritants like the blue dye are the because but it made it so much worse. I want to stop itching I cannot even read or put makeup on anymore as suddenly allergic to everything and it was a daily routine which disrupts my asd. I am level 1 but functioning at a level 2 it feels like. My PCP old one who moved that I miss Dr. Lea had said I had alopecia and thought it could be stress as was not products at that time. That was over a year ago. New PCP I had to move to said the past 3 times I asked her to look that it was red erythemoys raised papules i do not know if spelled right as sleepy and sick with kidney infection right now but getting better due to antibiotics My diagnosis are as follows Abnormal acth function always low and endocrinologist had done the cortisol simulation test 2 or 3 times last year making sure I took no steroids and the cortisol would time nicely so she was stumped. She did a pituary MRI and no tumor. This was a year ago. Neuro said likely due to pots. I was one point off on pots test but he does not care he said. He gives meds for syncope. Connective tissue disorder mild likely nos genetic doctor said. Still waiting on exome he wants to do genome but pricey. I did a connective tissue panel out of pocket before and had variants of uncertain significance col2a1 c.2156GA p.Arg719His FLNB c.461CT p.Pro154Leu My children had exomes not youngest but he age 5 and level 3asd had microarray and autism id panel come back normal Matthew my oldest 10 who went through a bad regression 2 years ago had variants of uncertain significance but would have to look on what genes as forgot most seemed not likely to because harm thankfully. Mine they do not know. Emma was good on her exome too. She is 6. Matthew and Emma are level 2 asd and all have comorbidities too. I have mildy low lying cerebral tonsils not enough for chiari like Emma whom also has seizures mainly focal though Emma and Katherine the sister I mention are like a 1010 on beighton scale. I sadly was diagnosed with hypermobility but did not meet the criteria on the beighton scale as I was like 1 point off from a mild diagnosis. Endocrinologist and neuro thought I had ehlers danlos. They are monitoring my daughter as they have to watch over time of course. My test was almost 2 years ago however and I since have developed chronic daily dislocations and subluxations over the summer genetics refered to medicine doctor for help. Still waiting to schedule apt. Mitral valve prolapse with posterior thickened leaflets heart valve regurgitation mitral aortic and tricuspid mild. Tachycardia high blood pressure low BP orthostatic hypotension. Possible pots as explained up there. Being monitored for long qt syndrome. Going To see what they say next week as did a montior for them. I have lung nodules likely due to mrsa fungal lung infection I had almost 2 years ago likely due to the chickens we had the infectious disease specialist said they found due to my sputum that had blood in it I asked them to test at pulmonary I also have a cyst they cannot place the location of. They said middle mediastinum likely bronchogeal on the first angiogram that electrophysiology was doing to look for aortic coarctation I was negative for this Then the 6 months follow up ct showed likely esophageal cyst gastro did esophagram and did not see this Need another follow up so not sure. I have multiple kidney stones and actually just passed a small one a couple days ago with my infection. I think the most I had was either 16 or 17. They are on both kidneys but other wise good kidney function. I have hematuria persistently but every once in a while it vanishes. Enough for them to be concerned of bladder cancer. Scope was good but shows my duplex kidney duplicated collecting systems for me my son has this but duplicated artery I have pelvic prolapse and I also have had history of hematoma during c section and partial collapsed lung afterwards tears endometriosis seen during my laparoscopic tubal removal 2022 and I have history of gallstones removed over the summer and had 70 something jagged black stones also had my hiatel hernia corrected during this surgery.

16608,Shingles vaccine experience: My dad and I got the vaccines mom caught shingles no comparison disease is 100 worse.
16612,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I do not remember it in the US but some of my friends my age in the UK do. I got the vaccine.
16616,Right before I started on my latest medication for arthritis I had the flu shot Covid shot and shingles shot at my doctors appt. All one right after the other. Apart from some expected arm soreness I was fine.
16627,Rsv.: The vaccine will help They did not administer it to our baby because it was not considered RSV season at the end of August last year. I SEARCHED high and low for that silly shot all over the state finally found one he got it administered on Wednesday and he was admitted to the childrens hospital on Saturday. Thankfully he did not need any respiratory support they admitted him in abundance of caution because he was in the NICU for respiratory failure. They told me that it might have been worse if he did not have the vaccine and they were currently studying the effects of the vaccine while using it as treatment. Saline and suction will be your best friend. We bought the Dr. Nose Bot when he was being discharged and it really works well way better than any other electronic non hospital grade suction. If you have any doubts trust your gut and go to the hospitalurgent care to be safe. You Are the best parent for your baby. You got this
16630,: My sister has been hospitalized with lung infections and is currently hospitalized and the doctor told her the infection was moving around like an entity. No antibiotic has worked. She has received the vaccines every year since they came out.
16631,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My husband lost vision in his eye from shingles as well. Its serious.
16632,Shingles vaccine experience: Ill tell you from experience shingles is no joke It started out feeling like tennis elbow but a day or two more in my god I thought I was dying. I Have never experienced pain like that before. Id like to get the shot but I Am not quite old enough to have insurance cover but as soon as I am I Am going for it.
16633,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles more than once and my dr strongly recommended i get vaccine Have Not had it since and the only side effect was just a painful arm
16635,Has anyone tried Varicella Zoster Vaccine?: Yes. It doesn t work. I tried it 3 times. It made my OB s severely worse for a long time. Good luck if you do try it. But I saw you re recently diagnosed. Please consider antiviral therapy if you re looking to minimize future OB s. There is no silver bullet for HSV.
16637,I made at least a couple posts here going back a full year in a few weeks the day I took Cipro for a non infection and then 2023 took a turn for the worse. I initially thought the issue was mild since I mostly had joint discomfort but monthslong PNlike symptoms as well as other shooting paint arms neck face legs that started out severely very little sleep for awhile and took a long time to clear outshowed that I was wrong. My mood was greatly affected and the distraction of the issue took a good six months of my life last year where I was totally occupied with researching trying to rehab failing getting new supplements losing sleep etc. I did still manage to work play with the kids after a couple months at the low point of not being able to do much of that at all and make some progress. I do not know when my last post here was. I kept telling myself that statistically most people seem to turn a corner between 6 and 9 months. At 6 months which was August I think I was improving but still could not train with any intensity and still had neuropathy at night. BY 9 months November everything had basically dissipated. BY 12 months now I am 100 recovered I took 1x500mg Cipro. I know some take way more. While there is no absolute threshold of amount of drug taken onset of symptoms clearly I would have been worse if I would have taken more. Thank God I said something to my wife about discomfort who remembered from Nursing school over a decade before about Cipro side effects. I could not do knee pushups. I had trained with high intensity for years powerlifting weightlifting general resistance training grappling martial arts etc.. At my low point I could not walk 1000 steps without getting dayslong injuries in my distal hamstrings tendons and could not do knee push ups without severe shoulder elbow and even neck pain. I could not focus. My mental health was strongly impacted. I was busy. I have children am a home owner have 2 pt jobs and am a fulltime postgraduate research student. Fortunately people understood that I was unwell and I was able to take a break but the mental burden of it all was heavy. One of my children did not want to play with me one day when we were out because he said I was too hurt to play so he wanted to play with a buddy of mine. He meant it sweetlybut man it hurt I focused on what I could do. I have a background in exercise science. I took the recommended supps and did all I could do to start building range of motion and make positive adaptations. I do not think this caused me to be healed since it was all of a sudden and not slow and linear but I do think this helped. I began to simply live. After my big slump AprilJune 2023 I decided simply to live and not let this burden me in terms of the pain. I had to let this go and find what might be good about it. What do I really value in life what really matters would everything be worth it if I lost my physical health? I am fully recovered. How do I know? Since last November I have moved houses days of moving heavy boxes flights of stairs lifting awkward objectsno issue begun training BJJ again no issues begun lifting heavy weights according to my old schedule again presses weighted pull ups squats etc. with no issue have been sick kids with colds flu and even shingles I thought it was Ciproimagine how relieved I was to learn it was only shingles. I recovered in 3 weeks to get PN like shingles symptoms after cipro and recover fully was a great send off. I have eaten lots eaten little had alcohol treats and sweets and also been very healthy. I have had a minor injury elbow tendinosis that while likely a latent effect downstream of cipro was very mild and has mostly gone away with physio exercises. What helped me most? I always felt more psychologically than anything best when taking CoQ 10 and Magnesium and ALA 1200 mgday. I felt best when eating something like a Mediterranean diet. I felt best when being as active as possible as opposed to doing as little as necessary gave me a sense of effort and control. I felt best when forgetting about Cipro and focusing on my work and family. I felt better over time. it is really just that time. Yes I am youngish mid 30s. Yes I was healthy and fit before this. Yes I only took one 500 mg dose. Yes I responded immediately and thanks to this sub with good supps. These are all factors in my favour. Yet my reaction was almost immediate within hours of the first dose and I believe had I taken more or the full round this would have been an exponentially longer process I still believe if that were the case 90 healing would come but perhaps it would take years. Unexpected silver linings? While I could say many things one thing sticks out. We decided to move houses many years before we initially were planning to and found something of a dream home. I sincerely believe that I would not have been open or looking or mentally prepared to do this if cipro had not happened. We do not always see how changes in focus and perceptions reorient us to good things and open new doors All the best everyone
16639,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Yet I know several healthy doctors that had heart attacks one to two years after getting the Covid vaccine
16641,I have got the shingles: I noticed this rash on Tuesday I started Valtrex Wednesday around 2 I am hoping it does not get worse I do have two more small spots on my back it is in total 4 small patches
16642,I got my first outbreak in 2019 and have gotten them like 23 times a year since. I always catch it super early so it s never gotten bad but I m getting a little freaked out even though I m the picture of health? All that I can come up with is that it s some weird reaction to getting C covid as the second time was 3 months after. Other than that maybe stress or a high arg in e diet? I m a 39 year old male and honestly the picture of health perfect blood pressure cholesterol great shape I go to the gym daily I rarely drink and when I do not until I black out. Anyways I ve been on val t rex for a month because the previous 2 outbreaks it came back 3 days after I was off the antivirals but now I m afraid when I stop this round it ll come right back. I ve also already gotten shin gri x and it hasn t helped at all as far as I can tell I honestly started to spiral then I found this group and it grounded me to see how common this was becoming. I rarely ever get the blisters because I catch it so early but is there anything anyone can recommend as an immune booster to help stave these off for a few months? Also is anyone else just living with them? How do you do that? Do you just stay on val t rex indefinitely? Hope I get some answers but if not thanks everyone who s already shared in here
16645,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: The vaccine eventually becomes less effective. If you've gotten it early (even if ""early"" is at 50 when it's first available to you), its effectiveness will have waned by the time you are most susceptible to severe effects from the virus. It was only tested in adults over 50 and it's effective for about 10 years."
16646,I stepped on a rusty nail a few weeks back and went and got a tetanus shot. Well that turned into shingles. Just got over them. Nothing is safe anymore medically
16652,41 and got Shingles: I had shingles at 22 it super sucked for about a week and took a couple months for the itchingspots to fully go away. That was a little over twenty years ago and luckily I have not ever had a reoccurrence.
16655,41 and got Shingles: Was maybe 30 when I got them. Actually thought I had scraped my side at work. Just kept getting worse so I saw the doc. Miserable does not begin to describe them. Got the shots a few years ago. Now a buddy posted he has them after getting the shots.
16660,Shingles vaccine: I never had shingles but know 2 people who have outbreaks. I will take 24 hours of flu like symptoms anyday over what they experience. And the 2nd shot just got my arm sore for 3 days.
16661,Sadbe Questions: I do not think at this point the Shingles vaccine will have an effect. Any vaccine modulates the immune system just like SAD BE. For example when I received the C covid vaccine my weekly OB s returned. But when I did a booster dose of SAD BE later on the weekly OB s stopped again. So you should be fine.
16670,Is my boyfriend in danger?: You get shingles from yourself as your link says. You don't catch shingles. Copied and pasted below: You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles. You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine.
16673,Shingles vaccine: How far apart do the shingles shots need to be administered? I think I got mine in August shingles Covid and flu all at once I was laid out the next day but I think it was just a lot a once. I need to schedule my second shot and I think Ill feel better than the first time around.
16677,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had shingles on the forehead Late Sept. after losing my dog unexpectedly. Had valtrex already take cymbalta daily for fibro. I was not coping well with the stress and ended up with pain in the ocular nerve. Week 2 another rash on the chin as well. Ramsay hunt maybe? I definitely had brain zaps and what I would think is an ocular migraine. I tried to go back to work too early. Ended up having a seizure at work fell from standing gave myself a huge concussion and tbi. So you mentioning these brain zaps is making me wonder how much of my lingering pain is post shingles in addition to brain injury. So thank you for this post. I know that I am probably an outlier but If your mom feels weird Deja vu flashbacks fogged vision she needs to sit down and stay down. Its better to have a seizure from sitting than full standing. Lots of potential for injury. Wish I had know. I was having dream flashbacks every 15 mins the morning of my seizure. Anywho hoping your mom is not as problematic of a case ETA that was my 3rd case of shingles first time on the head. I have had 1 round of shingrex but broke out before I could get my second dose.
16681,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had the chicken pox vaccine. I still got chicken pox in 4th grade. Just about everyone in my class didwe were all vaccinated against chicken pox. My younger siblings did not catch it.
16683,Hello all partner slept with over 50 sex workers that is the number he admitted could be way higher. I found out myself if I knew firsthand i would not have started a relationship with him. I think about breaking up over this because I cannot get it out of my mind but that is a whole other story. I am concerned about my health. I am currently 25 and will get a PAP soon. I Am in the relationship for a year. Had sex with condom oral without. I am vaccinated once against HPV. He does not have any signs of warts and has been tested for other STDs. My question  How screwed am I? I will take PAP smears for the rest of my life. I Am asking in the worst case scenario if it is caught early will I be fine? Health issues scare me. And ontop of that I cannot trust any man anymore and am scared of sex. I cannot stop crying. Edit thank you all for your comments. I really appreciate you guys
16685,My shingles vaccine had no side effects whatsoever.
16688,Could my life be anymore interesting Had chicken pox for the 1st time 3 yrs ago. Got the shingles vaccine 3 months ago. Told today that the rash I have is shingles WinningAtLife
16691,Its a direct result of the vaccine but yea shingles. Fear porn. PS Ivermectin cures cancer pass it on.
16692,Argh. Reports of GBS after the RSV vaccines both brands alert www.fda.govsafetymedic...
16693,41 and got Shingles: My wife got shingles in grad school due to the stress. I think it can attack at any point.
16694,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I know you cannot give out medical advice. Maybe I am just hoping for some insight? I am F 58 and got chronic you rtica ria from the Modern a vaccine. I would like to get the shingles vaccine but am disinclined because of this. Any non medical advice thoughts?
16695,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: If they are on parts of your face you could lose your sight. My neighbor has scars from it. An old boss of mine got shingles on her face and it spread into her ear and to her brain. She is now intellectually disabled as a result. It is so sad. She was such a strong and intelligent person and while she is relatively ok low support needs she is definitely not as she once was. Shingles is no joke and people need to be very careful. edit Oops I think I replied to the wrong person. Should not multitask.
16698,Lady I know had her Covid booster and shingles shot and was very ill the next day. Asked her why she would had them she replied well its what were supposed to do our doctors tell us. She Is elderly and too sweet to argue with her just said I would not do it.
16700,I am getting conflicting answers from my doctor and my daughter's doctor. And my RIGHT NOW mom is giving me completely different information than either doctor. I have shingles it is been about 10 days since onset. My daughter now has an almost identical rash on her shouldersupper chest. Just a little more defined and separated blisters. I thought for sure she got chicken pox. Took her to the doctor today and she says it is shingles because she was vaccinated for chicken pox. I do not understand I thought shingles itself was not contagious...? She also said we need to wear a mask because it is contagious through droplets from breathing and cover sores because the blister fluid also is contagious. I have a 9 week old baby and my 35 yo husband has never had chicken pox. Obviously worried for them. My other 7 children are all over a year old and so are vaccinated. But now I am worried they could all catch shingles. I am just trying to understand. This is so stressful. ETA the other doctor told me it is not transmittable by mouth is not directly transmittable to another person who is vaccinated or has had chickenpox.
16703,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yes. Had it nearin my ear. Truly unbearable.
16705,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I turned 50 in September. On my birthdaya Friday I scheduled a blood draw and vaccines covid shingles flu. I thought it would be a rough weekend but I only had flu symptoms that first night. whew
16707,Shingles after covid: Happened to my then 17yearold brother when he got it the first time a few years back. The way SARSCoV2 casually fucks people up no matter the age is terrifying.
16708,Shingles shot: I Have heard its usually either or hit you like a rock. I posted this around 3am local time waking up with horrible joint and muscle pain. I really do not want shingles if the shot hurts this much. I took off work today to sleep as much of it away as i can.
16710,Tell me about your vaccine flares: Lymph nodes go nuts The ones near armpit and on the neckthroat on whichever side it was given. So the pain is relatively localized but the fatigue is intense. Takes me out noddinghead kind of drowsiness.
16712,My sister is a chemo nurse. When she turned 50 she obediently got the shingles vaccine One week later she got shingles.
16713,Got my Shingles vaccine: Did my first shingrix covid and flu shots on the same day. Totally survived unscathed. I recommend doing yoga or upper body strength after the shots if you can  really helped with arm stiffness.
16718,"PSA: Vaccinated? Yes, you CAN still get shingles: Lucky you! I'm about 3.5 weeks in and the rash has pretty much disappeared but I have insane itching in the area where the rash was. It has been keeping me up at night...I try so hard not to scratch but it feels soooo good when I do. Then it gets MORE itchy! It's driving me crazy."
16722,Shingles vaccine: So true and I Am saying this as someone who has bad reactions to many but not all vaccines. I assume Ill be fine but occasionally get knocked on my ass or have a bad reaction. Its always better than getting the illness itself
16727,Pt came to me with left side of face dropping no slurred speech or other signs. Had a shingles vaccine few hours ago. Sent them to the emerge right away. They came back with diagnosis of bells palsy and a r x of antivirals and steroids. My question is do the have to get shin gri x in activated shingles vaccine again after the antiviral therapy course. Its the first dose in a two dose series. If yes or no please explain why.
16728,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I had shingles. There is no side effect of the vaccine that is as bad as Shingles I was around 40 and mine was on my neck ear and face. I Am lucky it went only next to my eye and not in it. The nerve pain went all the way down to my left arm hand and fingertips. The rash is nothing compared to the pain which is like jolts of electricity not to mention the incredible fatigue. The only pain I Have had that was worse was active labor and giving birth
16730,Shingles and methotrexate: I got shingles before I even had an RA dx. It was torture. I am going to get the second part of my shingles vaccine today Definitely talk about it with your MD when you are recovered. Like youyescoffeepleeze and youMrsredfast said you can get them more than once. Feel better soon
16733,Not sure why Shingles is trending. But here is a reminder to get vaccinated if you are 50. I heard nightmare stories for years put it off then had to delay it due to COVID boosters. Got it this year not a big deal. Did the 2step process. 2nd shot just a bit of fatigue.
16740,Shingles and methotrexate: I got shingles while I was on methotrexate and a biologic. I do not know whether the methotrexate andor biologic was the main factor in it happening or if it was just plain bad luck getting it fairly young I was 29 but I took the antivirals and I think that helped a lot. It definitely was not a good time and I stayed home from work a few days but overall I do not think I had it too bad thankfully
16741,I know five women who got shingles after they had the covid shot.
16743,Anyone with experience dealing with shingles or postherpetic neuralgia?: Yes she is under specialised care already as she has stage 4 lung cancer as well. And she had been hospitalised as well due to the shingles. Hence the check ups which include regular blood tests and xrays. I am here to see if anyone who has experienced shinglesPHN has any suggestions on what they have done to cope with the pain
16744,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: And I learned like 2 years ago there was a vaccine? My wife told me she got it. I called bullshit. I should have known better she is always right.
16748,I was informed that I should have an updated Tetanus shot. I said no thank you. I had the Shingles vaccine several years ago got the shingles virus for first time shortly after. Never having another vaccine again. I Have changed to a wholistic MD now.
16751,RSV Vaccine: Also in NSW and I was told it is only offered to highrisk babies at the moment as they are having some stock issues. Our bub got one as he falls into one of the categories but we had to insist on it.
16756,Shingles vaccine: Shingles was some of the worst pain I Have ever had in my life and I Have experienced a lot of pain. And apparently my case was mild because I did not experience permanent nerve damage or scarring. If there is any way to protect yourself from Shingles please use it
16758,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: I had them when I was 32. Stress can bring them on. Now vaccinated. Never want them again.
16761,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: You are ignorant. I know another person who is on permanent disability because one of the vaccines in the military fucked up his leg. Yes the military acknowledged it.
16765,Houston pediatricians that offer RSV vaccine: Texas children pediatrics on Kirby and west Alabama has it. Just got it done for our infant.
16766,Shingles vaccine: I had no after effects from either shingles vaccine but then again I did not from the Covid ones either. I have heard of friends having some very tolerable side effects though so it varies from person to person. However as many others have stated having shingles is far worse and last for much longer than any side effects from an inoculation.
16767,shingles with no rash: I also had terrible pain for 56 days before the blisters. My PT guy thought it was gout. In the hospital they thought it was muscular. But at least they gave me Zaldiar which is tramsol and Tylenol. After 6 weeks of relentless pain I found a pain specialist and he injected Botox into the affected areas my whole arm. The paid subsided and by the next day I was off pain meds. Still have some tingling but it is fading away slowly
16776,My husband got it about a month after his shingles vaccine. Only a 2 chance . There is a prescription you can get. It helped immediately.
16777,Shingles vaccine: I just finished my second shot and did not have any problems at all. I am a complicated medical case so I expected something to go sideways...
16781,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: No chicken pox party needed. My cousin brought it home from daycare and I was covered in hives that same day. Mom was halfway to her mothers with me and my sister looked in the rear view and I had red dots all over my face. This was right before the vaccine came out. It was a hassle and a half explaining to every new school and doctor I went to that I got the actual chicken pox so I did not needget the shot. But I have to ask has anyone heard of chicken pox lollipops? My first boyfriend said he got some chicken pox infested suckers so he would get it and get it over with. Because as other redditors pointed out pre vaccine it was way better to get it in preschool than as an adult
16786,Mounjaro  Shingles??: I can t remember. I did have an injection site patch of a rash with red bumps one time and I can t remember if it was 7 5 or 12 5.
16787,Got my Shingles shots in 2022. That mess hurt. Got flu shot last month and will get COVID booster before end of month.
16790,Sorry for the length. Bit of background my mom has always been pretty controlling using money as a tool. I kept my head down paid tuition 100 with scholarships worked to pay about 12 living expenses they paid 12 through professional school. Told them I was eloping but asked me not to. They and FIL paid for a modest wedding then i noped off to the opposite coast 20 years ago with fresh grad husband and a clunker car they gave us as a wedding present. I have my own money now and have not asked for anything else. I am certain she thinks I owe them for supporting me and maybe I do but I certainly do not feel that way about my own daughter. My mother also will not back down on anything. I have never heard her say she has made a mistake. I apologize to my own nuclear family on purpose when needed to break that cycle. I think my daughter and I are building a much healthier relationship and I am thrilled about the human she is becoming. When my daughter was born precovid I required that everyone get uptodate on every shot shingles flu everything before they visited. This was fine if annoying with everyone on both sides no one had ever been vaccine I was not going to have anyone on a plane then around my newborn. My parents visited once or twice a year for her first three years and we always went there once but that stopped for a couple of years at the start of covid during which my parents were careful. My parents got the first covid vaccine and we vacationed with them that spring we drove because daughter too young for vaccine. My mom told me my sister was not getting it she is vulnerable because of health conditions and I called sister an idiot. My mother blew up at me during the vacation and then promptly became vaccine herself. She refused her first booster got covid. When they got it that first time they had originally planned to be here daughter still too young for vaccine but I had told them no booster and mask on plane no visit. My mom tantrumed again during that call and did not contact me for 6 mos. I am fairly certain they passed it to my grandmother in her nursing home who died from it based on timing. They hid all of it from me and I found out only from a cousin that my parents had it then seeing my gmother's death cert listing it as because of death then doing some math. My parents led me to believe that it was her dementia. I can work from anywhere so offered to take daughter to stay with them the following summer if they would get all their shots. They were initially super excited but then declined when i reiterated the vaccine requirement which really hurt me and damaged my opinion of them almost beyond any repair. I stayed nearby with FIL did not tell them and contacted them to let them see daughter outdoors the final weekend after she was old enough for her shots. That was 2.5 years ago. Have not seen them since. Have traveled with inlaws being careful. In the meantime daughter has developed RAD asthma like. Her aunt had it so it is just genetic. I have been in an ambulance with her turning blue and passing out and in the ER begging drs to do something. She is been hospitalized twice with oxygen down into the 70s and has missed a day or two of school this year to stay home and medicate to avoid the ER. Her triggers are viruses and things like RSV go real nasty REAL quick. We mostly we have it under control with meds and home o2 monitoring now to stay out of the ER. But she spontaneously talks about how frightening it was not to be able to breathe which breaks my heart. Everyone knows about this. I have been calling my parents 4 or 5 times a year they call me maybe once. My mother's dog died yesterday I am a dog lover and from my perspective she tried to use it to manipulate me. She emailed about dog I tried to call no answer. Several hours later emailed to ask to visit. I called her and sympathized about the dog listened to her usual health summary she loves talking about all her joint replacements and updated her about our lives these days. I said she is welcome if she gets all of her shots. She screamed that vaccines do not work and they are not coming and hung up on me. I am not sure if she is anti all vaccines or just covid boosters because of her tantrums and hang ups. It feels like she would rather die than see her own grandchild. Which is certainly...a choice. She feigns to be SO EXCITED about being a grandmother and is usually all about family. Certainly daughter is exposed to unvaccinated people and no vaccine is 100 effective but we mask for the return to school after holidays mask in crowded places time our vaccines to be most effective around the holidays and I just try to minimize risk as much as I can control without ruining my kids' childhood. It seems like such an easy ask and suddenly becoming vaccine in your 70s seems insane. I do feel sorry for my dad who sounds pitiful asking when we will visit because I do not think he is driving this car but he is also not getting out. For reference I fired my extremely lefty therapist postcovid because she has always been vaccine and suddenly she could not be helpful for the biggest issue in my life. I also disinvited a family from Thanksgiving with plenty of notice because they were not all up to date on everything and one of my guests was 80 and recovering from surgery. I am visiting a cousin next spring and have confirmed they are up to date. These rules are applied evenly to EVERYONE. I guess I am looking for any hot takes. What is she thinking here? I will not change my mind about the rules or vaccines but would love to hear perspectives from other grandparents. My FIL thinks they are nuts. I do feel very sorry for my daughter and mother a bit because she has only 1 grandmother and her childhood is flying by. My parents also have and will only have 1 grandchild. I may also be jeopardizing daughter's grandparent 529 see above very controlling with money but we have saved for complete undergrad it would have been nice if she wants grad school or to give to her kids but not lifechanging. I do wonder if daughter will resent me for being so rigid on this. And whether the fact that this is a battle of wills with my mother which is definitely a trigger for me from childhood is making me do things normal people would not. If my daughter has a child I will cut off my own arm if that is what my daughter says it takes to see her. I cannot understand and it just seems like she cannot possibly love us at all and still behave this way. On the other hand am I actually using this as an unreasonable testexcuse because i dislike her personality so much? I have resented for a very long time that she prefers one of my cousins and my cousin's children to me doing all sorts of things for them and positively lighting up in their presence. She seems to worship my cousin the popular type. I do not think so but I no longer have a therapist to try to separate the threads out lol.
16792,I KNOW from it my SIL a close friend got hardened lungs friend kidney damage dad pericarditis effusion two who got severe shingles one got AF during hospitalised 2 who got seizure onset during continued. 0ne died collapsed dead months later. All close to me.
16797,"Just got the flu shot and now I feel like I might be coming down with the flu. I had a sore arm for a couple of days after the shot, but then started feeling achy and tired. Now, I have a low-grade fever and a headache. Could it be a reaction to the vaccine or just bad timing? Has anyone else experienced this after getting the flu shot?"
16804,Shingles vaccine: I felt bad for a day. Got it Friday afternoon. Was good to go by Monday. Much better wasting a weekend than getting shingles.
16810,First time getting singles on my forehead eyelid and scalp any tips for face wash and healing?: Thank you so much for sharing your experience your areas affected are the exact same as mine and I Am so sorry you went through such a difficult experience. I can completely relate to what you are describing and the pain has made me think many times I cannot live like this it is comforting to know it eventually ends and I have been trying to breathe when the waves and punches of pain come meeting them and breathing until they pass Thank you for your well wishes and I will share updates as I can. I hope the appointment with the neurologist goes well and that there are options to support you in your recovery and healing. Sending great care your way and wishes for continued recovery
16811,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: That Is why you should not wear anti blood circulation denims.
16817,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox so bad I have scars on my face. My wife 33F just received her old people shingles surprise. That shit was awful. Shingles does not care
16820,RSV Vaccine: Baby got it upon release from the NICU and was totally fine. No changes to behavior at all
16827,Is keeping the cervix really a big cancer risk if you have received the Gardasil vaccine are HPV negative and have never had an abnormal pap smear?: I assume that is largely because cis women are removing already heavily diseaseddamaged uteruses and trans men trans mascs often are not. In my case I have severe endo and suspected adeno. Time under anesthesia is directly correlated to recovery time and I anticipate being out for a couple hours at least while they try to get all the endo out. Not adding the time necessary to create a cuff to that time under should help along with having one less wound to heal.
16828,"Shingles shot?: If your doctor is specifically recommending it to you, then more than likely, it is a good idea to get it. The chicken pox vaccine is only 82% effective against chicken pox and shingles, so there's still a chance you can get chicken pox (and shingles) despite being vaccinated. The varicella vaccine only guarantees that if you were to develop chicken pox or shingles, it wouldn't be as bad as if you developed it without any protection. But it doesn't guarantee that you won't ever get chicken pox or shingles in your lifetime."
16834,Effectiveness of rsv vaccineantibodies? Nurses have you noticed less admissions from babies that received this?: It is SO EFFECTIVE I Am not a nurse and can only speak from personal experience We got my newborn the RSV shot when he was 2 weeks old. 2 weeks after that our toddler 26 months at the time came down with RSV and I Have never seen him so sick. It was really stressful and honestly super scary. Our entire house was RSV contagion to the extent that even my husband and I caught it  although it was just a head cold for us of course In that entire time our newborn did not even so much as sneeze. I am absolutely convinced it kept us from a really serious hospital visit. We told our pediatrician about the experience and he was hyped about it and confirmed that we definitely would have landed ourselves in the hospital had our newborn caught RSV at such a young age Getting the shot will absolutely protect your LO and it is 1000 the right call. I cannot stress it enough
16837,I believe that my bursitis in my shoulder was a result of SIRVA...from a shingles vaccine that I got about 8 years ago...
16838,"Initial Symptoms: Hey there! Seeking advice - my friend recently received the HPV vaccine and has been experiencing unusual symptoms. She's been dealing with joint pain, fatigue, and headaches ever since. Have any of you had similar reactions to the HPV vaccine? If not, what symptoms made you realize something was off after getting the HPV shot? Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Stay healthy, everyone! ??"
16840,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Covid 19 and measles are two active infections that knock out your natural immunity while they are around. I would assume you had one or the other very recently.
16841,Was this really a thing?: I was a similar age when I got shingles as well. I did not get it around my midsection which is apparently the most common. I got the have it on my head and face. Had to go to an optometrist and get my eyes checked to make sure it was not also on my optic nerve. It did make one eye shut and I got some scaring on my nose. I asked my doctor about the vaccine and they told me I was too young to get it. Go figure.
16844,Shingles vaccine: I got mine early due to my psoriasis treatment weakening my immune system. It was not that bad at all.
16845,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I Am a young millennial who got the chickenpox vaccine. Later my mom became vaccine and took me to a chickenpox party to make it look like I could get chickenpox. Someone correct me if I Am wrong I thought you could still get shingles even if you have had the chickenpox vaccines because you may still have gotten the virus but the vaccine prevented you from being symptomatic.
16846,LOL. I did the same. I proceeded that with a Shingle shot and that one hurt
16848,No weight loss before 1.7mg of Wegovy: About the 3rd week into my 1mg dose I had major bloating heartburn nausea and these little burps that I can only describe as sulfur burps. I injected my 2nd dose of 1.7mg Friday morning and I was up all night last night with major bloating that was just too uncomfortable to sleep through.
16849,Shingles: I delayed the second shot due to a brain injury and this cancer over the 2 last years. My GP said I can get that second shot at my leisure and it will still be effective. I am going to wait a little to see how Letrozole goes. Its been good so far.
16853,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: My daughter got it at 16 months and her lips and fingers turned purple and she was lethargic and had trouble breathing. Get it.
16854,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: My shingles was constant nerve pain. It is very unlikely to develop on both sides of the body. You usually get it on one side or the other in connecting dermatomes. A dermatome is served by a single spinal nerve. It is always possible but you could have also had some sort of contact dermatitis. I have had other rashes so bad that I cried in the shower. Shingles was worse because it is not just the rash. The itching set in as the blisters healed but not during the rash. I had it on my head and wanted to bash my head against the wall to get rid of the pain.
16855,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Used CBD topical on the injection area due to swelling and Tylenol for the funk.
16860,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Last summer I felt sick like the flu. Two days prior I thought I had an ingrown hair on my crotch that was tender did not think anything of it. So went to the dr and tested me for flu and it was negative. Came home took a shower and on my butt cheek I had three raised bumps. It look like a prong got me. I was very uncomfortable and my leg started to hurt like achy . The dr said it was shingles and I went on the antiviral medication but it did not do anything. I was driving in the car and I got a pain down my leg that was unbearable. It went away in like 3040seconds. Did not know what the heck that was. Turns out I got a complication from shingles called Post Herpetic Neuralgia PHN. I had the pain once a day did not know when it was coming but it took me to my knees it was so bad. I was on Gabapentin 100mg 3x's a day. Did not really feel like it did much. The intense pain lasted two weeks but I have been numb on my butt cheek the entire year. Definitely better but I had no idea how debilitating shingles could be. I tell everyone I know get the vaccine. I would get very anxious anticipating when the pain was coming back. Pray you all have a speedy recovery
16862,For context I have had 3 shots of Gardasil9 as a late teen before becoming sexually active. Since then I have only had protected sex until I met my latest exbf. I have always been against taking birth control and going without a condom because I Have never felt comfortable enough with past partners. I started dating my ex in February this year and he has been the best and the most understanding partner in all other aspects. When my ex and I became sexually active this March he requested after our first few times of protected sex that we try without a condom. I know for a fact that he has always had unprotected sex with his past girlfriends and partners. Because of this I asked about his STIHIV testing history and he let me know he had just tested negative for everything since last December and has not been sexually active since then. I then proceeded to get tested myself for an STI panel HIV and HPV via a self swab. Came back negative for everything and we started having unprotected sex. I had a routine Pap smear in September which to my surprise came back positive for other high risk HPV non1618 and ASCUS. As expected I completely freaked out to say the least with the thought that I might have precancerous cells in my cervix and absolutely did not expect this considering I Am vaccinated. I decided to share this news with my ex we have not been in contact since the breakup in a somewhat accusatory tone and he responded by saying he remembers me mentioning I was vaccinated against HPV and that hes sorry if hes the one that caused it. He also shared a test he took recently also in September for HPV which came back negative  which I understand is not entirely accurate for men. Then asked me to let him know what my upcoming tests show. I think that hes been respectful about this but I cannot help but feel some type of unexplained anger considering the fact hes the one who asked me to have unprotected sex. Of course I consented to it so maybe I Am more mad at myself. The entire process has just been super stressful and maybe I Am angry at him because I do not have anyone else to blame. I Am just having a really hard time navigating through my feelings and deciding if I Am really mad at my ex. Has anyone been through something similar?
16863,Shingles second vaccine: In my experience where you are right now was the hardest part of RA. I had swollen joints that did not make sense and for almost 2 years I went through several meds that did not work. Or they were brutal. Or both I promise it is going to get easier. It sounds like you have great MDs and that is huge. No matter what kind of dx you end up with you are doing all the right stuff. Keep me posted on what happens Sending good vibes
16864,Second Shingles Shot: My second was far worse good for you.
16865,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Shingles can be whaaaaatttt that one was annoying
16866,I got a Tdap the other day. Seems I had been remiss. Shockingly maybe it is my COVID arm or what lol. Did not hurt the next day. I might go brave my shingles shot.
16870,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to get it . Our baby received his at 35 wks in nicu born at 32. Ended up getting it from our kids at 3 wks adjusted STILL ended up in hospital for respiratory distress and needed oxygen. Docs all said it could have been even worse without the vaccine .
16877,RSV shot: I made sure my premie got the shot at the peds office a day after we were discharged from the nicu
16879,RSV vaccine: I took the vaccine myself and had zero side effects. Even the vaccine itself did not give any discomfort in my arm like the flushot did.
16882,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I am starting to feel tired and achy. I will be playing it up as much as possible so i do not have to cook dinner tonight
16883,How many women have monkey pox? Are the children boys? Seems to me its showing child sexual abuse. They should also release statistics on whether or not the infected are vaccinated for covid. I know A LOT of people who got shingles after their vaccine.
16884,It happened for my second shingles shot
16889,So I started talking to a gentleman on Sunday by Monday he asked if I wanted to meet for dinner since he would be in my area Friday night. I said sure. Confirmed the date yesterday. He got to the restaurant before I did. Had a great time laughing and talking all through dinner. Two hours later still standing outside in the cold I knew he was not feeling well because it was one of the things we talked about. He got his 2nd shingles shot yesterday and had a bit of a sinus thing. After about 20 minutes I said I could tell he was cold and not feeling well and should head to his hotel. AND then I kissed him on the cheek and said good night. He stood there grinning. Got in my car and left. I guess it went well? Should I contact him and send a thank you note?
16890,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You can still get the shingles vaccine in the YOU.S. I got it at 28. Though tbf I Have had shingles before as well.
16893,I was diagnosed Monday 2 days ago but had severe headaches for a few days before and pain especially on scalp. My rash does not look like the ones online. I have a very large hard bump right above my eyebrow and the rest are smaller going up into my scalp. All are raised though. The Dr said they are infected. I had the shingles vaccine years ago but just my luck. This morning I woke up and the right half of my face is swollen and sticking out further than the other side. Just curious if anyone has experienced this. I am on antibiotics antiviral and gabapention.
16895,Shingles vaccine: I got the two shots this past year and no side effects. I do not even recall a sore arm.
16897,Shingles vaccine: I missed getting the vaccine last year at my physical when I was 50 because I had been really sick with RSV and wanted to wait until I was more healthy. Well I got busy and never got the vaccine and of course the day after Christmas ended up with shingles. It was on my ear and neck and I continue to have excruciating pain in my ear. I have nerve pain up and down my arm in my neck along my collar bone and on my chest. Its been awful. GET THE VACCINE I will definitely be doing that as soon as I am well enough to get it.
16898,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My daughter born at 28 weeks got beyfortus in NICU last winter season. She never got rsv. This winter season I chose not to give it to her and she got sick with rsv and ended up in the hospital needing oxygen support for three days. I regret making that choice.
16902,It started after a stressful event. I felt tingling pain on the side of my neck. Over the next two days it spread down to my chest. The nerve pain was the worst. I cried when applying medicine on it. I do not know if this will help you guys but I took black tea baths and gently applied the black tea leaves on the area. Thankfully I skipped the blistering stage and went straight to scabbing. Thanks for reading stay strong.
16903,my mom just got shingles right after shoulder surgery. the stress from surgery can trigger it. keep an eye on your eyes if you get any lesions near there you need to get checked out. hope it let us up quickly
16904,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I have had them after scalp shingles when it also affected my jaw another time when it affected my temple. They do not go on forever but like everything else with shingles they go on a slow fade. Good luck to your mom. I doubt that it is any consolation but the last week of March I got an appointment for a neurologist for February of 2025. That was the soonest I could get. Seriously.
16907,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes totally flu symptoms I thought I was just coming down with something and that the itchy blister on my face was an allergic reaction to something that must have bitten me. Nope shingles. Never knew young people got it until then. Interestingly my doctor said the theory is that adults used to get periodic exposure to chickenpox when all the kids in the community got it so it kept up their immunity. For us we have not been exposed since we were kids so our immunity has waned and thus more shingles in younger people now
16909,Blister type sores: So I posted the other day asking if anyone got blisters that look like burns that are circular and look like round cig burns when they pop....and they itch BAD. A couple people said they had. I went to the doctor and he told me its in fact an allergic reaction likely from the kratom or an impurity in it. Just another reason to quit! Thought I would share in case anyone else has had this problem.
16910,"Rash on left arm, chest, and left inner thigh: I'm 28, male, 5'9, 215lbs, Caucasian. A little over a week ago I noticed little red rashes form on my left forearm, upper chest, and left inner thigh. The rashes on my thigh itch more (likely due to me scratching them), and have tried taking a baking soda bath, taking Benadryl, and treating the rashes with tea tree oil. I'm wondering if it's a combination of jock itch (I do martial arts), an allergic reaction to something, or possibly shingles. Slightly NSFW pictures here: <url>"
16913,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Holy shit. She really did fracture her skull. Found this Recounting the night she collapsed McDonald said she felt dizzy at the start of her set and had she not been on stage in front of friends and family for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic would have simply sat back down instead of trying to fight through it. Afterward McDonald received a battery of tests from doctors who said that she had no underlying condition and that the fainting spell was not linked to the vaccine. McDonald suffered a fractured skull and a concussion and still checks in with doctors but has had no lingering issues.
16917,Shingles vaccine: It did not bother me at all. However this was after two bouts of shingles where it felt like someone had run me through with a spear and was having fun wiggling it around. I may be an outlier though. We got a dozen vaccinations earlier this year for trips to Central and South American jungles including Yellow Fever Chikungunya Typhoid etc. which also did not bother me at all.
16918,Shingles vaccine experience: I had both shots and no reactions to them to speak of. Slight soreness in my arm each time not noticeable by the following day. I react strongly to some vaccines MMR D PT but not others so that is probably not much help. BUT yeah the shingles vaccine was fine for me. My poor brother developed shingles at about age 40 before he was scheduled to get the vaccine and he had a fairly mild case but it went on for months and months. A coworker of mine who is older developed shingles and had a much worse time but you do not even want to know.
16919,They definitely have side effects from the vaccine. Almost everyone I know did. But the discomfort FAR outweighs the nightmare that is shingles.
16923,Shingles vaccine: My wife has shingles and was miserable so I got the vaccine as soon as I was eligible. The second dose hurt more and for longer but it was not a big deal. I did not get any other symptoms besides pain and swelling around the injection site. It was basically all better on day 4. So 100x better than my wifes symptoms.
16926,41 and got Shingles: It is available but can be a fight. My sister is a high powered attorney and between those and ulcers her job has had a rough time on her health. My mom got shingles from an abscessed tooth. She still cannot hear well out of one of her ears.
16927,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: My dad who was the most stoic human being I have ever met said this hurts pretty bad when he got shingles. And he grimaced. To translate from Dadspeak for him to even say that much or to make an actual facial expression it had to be pretty damn bad. I had never heard him complain about ANYTHING before I did not even know he COULD feel pain I have gone through childbirth been hit by a semi suffer from migraines had an impacted and infected wisdom tooth and had covid 3 times I think of myself as pretty tough and I am scared of shingles because of watching my dad suffer through it. I think my reaction would be much less restrained than my father's was
16928,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Well damn. bad enough to where you reread a thread after someone says you answered the wrong guy and still think you answered the right question. I am feeling much better than I was this weekend but the closest approximate feeling I have with my shingles on my ribs and chest is a mix of Broke every rib on my right side and Red hot screwdriver being stabbed into my diaphragm.
16931,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: AGREED I had a relatively mild case and it was still the most painful thing I had in my life. I am sorry you had to go through that and have permanent damage. The vaccine pain was 1 day of minor pain in comparison.
16935,Has anyone had a bad experience after getting these shots? Both recommended by my gastro but I Am worried about getting are symptoms after.
16939,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Lol My ears have been ringing nonstop for about the last 18 months. They think it is tenitious. A noise machine at night set to brown noise helps me get some rest. Otherwise I struggle with sleep.
16940,Shingles vaccine experience: That is great Glad you got it done. My experience was bad but it was very temporary and MUCH better than shingles.
16942,Starting Kesimpta: I have been on Kesimpta for just over a year. The first dose did give me very mild flulike symptoms mostly a headache but also tired and a bit achey. I also took it a few hours before bed and did not bother with painkillers which was a mistake. Ever since then I have always taken it maybe an hour before bed with some paracetamol Tylenol in the US I think? and the next day I am fine.
16953,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yep. I got the vaccine when I was 13 or so because I had never had the chicken pox up until then. Even after my parents let me play with my cousin who had them to get them out of the way. Even then though it was around when they were starting to have one.
16957,RSV shot: My baby got it and she is fine. She Is 2 months now and she got it at 4 days. No offense but do not you understand RSV can kill babies? No babies have died from the shot. Babies die from RSV.
16958,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: it is different for everyone but definitely do not schedule anything really important a day or two after the shingles vaccine just in case you have a reaction. It does have a higher incident of side effects than most other vaccine vaccines. Felt like hell on the first and absolutely nothing on the second shot. Or skip it and be prepared to be wrecked for weeks or months if you end up with shingles. that is some pretty simple math in my book.
16960,"Shingles Vaccine: I had the vaccine and I feel like I did well. I got some swelling in my armpit lymph node and felt tired the next day but overall pretty okay. Also, it is two doses (two or more months apart? I don't remember exactly) Edit: I got Covid vaccine, flu, pneumonia, TDAP and shingrix all same day as I was a new DX and needed to play catch up."
16961,Its been a year since I completed my treatments including surgery chemotherapy and radiation. Following my second chemo I was hospitalized for a week with neutropenia. This was one of the most traumatic parts of my journey. then a family member came to carecare for me and brought me Covid. Everyone felt fucking awful and no one has been near me since. Now my labs are still showing low WBC and my lymphocytes continue to drop. I Am working with an internist who keeps telling me its OK to go out and live and take off my mask but given that my lymphocytes are only .40 I Am terrified to do so. I broke the seal and had a friend visit unmasked after he took public transportation. The next morning I had the sniffles panicked and took a Covid. Negative but I Am still freaked out. For anyone who has experienced this I would appreciate your perspective. Thank you for your consideration. Edit I should add that Taxol caused an anaphylaxis to Polysorbate 80 which is in WAY more stuff than you might imagine including some foods but specifically vaccines. I cannot get a covid booster flu shot RSV or shingles vaccine Solitary confinement and isolation have taken their toll too. It feels like a loselose canceling the big win of going Stage IV to NED. WOMP
16963,Took Shingrix shot 2 wks ago. About 4 days ago I woke up with all over my back that itch like mosquito bites few on upper legs. No I donhave bed bugs. spots are still there and itch. few have blisteredpopped and gone down and few more bumps popped up. Like chkn pox again. Side effects?: Allergic reaction bedbugs usually bites in a line. Mosquitos bite on exposed skin.
16965,I turned 50 in 2020 and my doctor said We should talk about shingles vaccine but a side effect is a fever and right now the last thing we want to do is give you a fever. referring of course to the covid19 pandemic. I have since gotten it and he was right. Feel better.
16969,UPDATE As you all suspected he was diagnosed with shingles. He now has the proper medicine and a couple more checkup appointments in the weeks to come. And it is all thanks to you guys I was able to convince him to go Thank you very much He is still suffering pretty badly and that is worrisome but at the same time I am so relieved. My husband 34M 230 lbs smoker has gotten a cluster of boilsblisters and a rash under his boxer shorts. At first we thought it was a sweat rash which it could still be but it went from only being on his lower right back to spreading ALL over his lower region. It is near his crotch lower back butt and now it looks like it is in the ridges of his crotch inbetween his legs and under his balls. He had only one region of blisterboils that were red and now there are more. One is turning a dark brown but the others are still red. Some are more raised than others. I have a picture of when it first happened and will try to upload in a comment. Advice I am trying to convince him to go to a dermatologist clinic. Could it be something serious? Maybe it is something that just needs a topical cream? Could it be more serious?
16970,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles shortly before my youngest was old enough for the second round of chickenpox vaccine and was so careful to NOT infect him before he could get his booster. Keeping him from getting chickenpox means hes never at risk for shingles. I had a mild case but it felt like someone lit my shoulder on fire for weeks with antivirals and I still have odd sensations there months later.
16971,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus took exception to that joke
16973,My husband has developed this rash all over his body. It is been going on since January He is seen his dermatologist several times and they have actually done a biopsy. It is Dermotitis. He is got a pharmaceutical cream he puts on it twice daily. And he will be getting a 2nd opinion since it is getting worse. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or know what it might be? He is had shingles and the shingles shot but this is a full on rash. Could this be a Celica rash?
16974,Rsv vaccine success stories with siblings in daycare?: My toddler has RSV and its been terrible for him. He went to the ER on Monday for a breathing treatment and now has an ear infection and bronchitis. Fever on and off breathing problems not eating fussier than normal sleep issues. My 7 week old just has a cough and some congestion and even tested negative. I got the vaccine when I was 34 weeks pregnant.
16977,Alex Berenson Why Did Pfizer Spend 14 Million For A Super Bowl Ad About Cancer? Ask Dr. Drew: Am I correct in saying the Synthetic modified mRNA that was mass produced with process 2 was only tested on 252 people? Very concerning. When a healthy 7 yr old boy has a heart attack 30 days after his first Pfizer experimental genomic jab and dies 8 days later we have a massive problem. This of course totally censored by MSM. Shocking state of affairs. Vote with your feet and do not comply
16978,Shingles vaccine: I am double heterozygous for Mthfr and I asked for the shingles vaccine. You get two shots about a month apart. For me it was a piece of cake. I do not react much to vaccines. My husband had one day of chills and fever but that was it. Last thing I want is to get shingles. I hear its extremely painful.
16980,"Just got diagnosed with chickenpox 3 weeks post-Moderna shot!: Hello everyone, I wanted to share my recent experience with you all. About 3 weeks after receiving my second dose of the Moderna vaccine, I started feeling extremely itchy all over my body. I initially brushed it off as a mild allergic reaction, but the itching became unbearable. I also noticed tiny red spots appearing on my skin, especially on my back and chest. I went to see my doctor and to my surprise, I was diagnosed with chickenpox. My doctor explained that the weakened state of my immune system post-vaccination may have allowed the dormant virus to reactivate. The itching and discomfort have been driving me crazy, and I'm now on antiviral medication to manage the symptoms. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Any advice on dealing with the itching and discomfort? I'm hoping for a speedy recovery and looking forward to feeling better soon. Stay safe and take care, everyone. ---"
16981,If I do not have shingles will the antivirals hurt me?: NAD but I was lucky enough to get shingles in my 30s. The pain is the worst part. Mine started right on my bra line as an irritant I just assumed it was detergent on it or something. My evening it was a burning terrible pain. I would never experienced anything like it. I was using ice packs just to numb it. My Dr gave me an open RX for antivirals because apparently insurance still will not cover the vaccine if you are under 50. Kind of shitty in my opinion not on the Dr. On the insurance. 50 of cases are in those 50.
16982,friend got shingles Covid booster two days ago is deathly ill in bed and does not know why sad really but with all the info out there about the jab and refusal to even acknowledge they have been hoodwinked is on the person. I have zero sympathy other than
16984,RSV Shot side effects?: I will defs keep an eye on it I too have never reacted like this with a vaccine so it threw me off
16988,"Just got my second Covid vaccine while still recovering from shingles. Update: I'm relieved to say that I didn't experience any additional side effects apart from feeling a bit fatigued for a couple of days. Despite still being on gabapentin for the pain, my shingles didn't worsen after the vaccination. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and how did you fare after your second dose?"
16990,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Got the first one yesterday. Besides a sore arm that is 80 gone now had no reactions. Took two Advil before bed and slept fine.
16991,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I got my vaccines as soon as I turned 50. Poked my husband to get it too. I was annoyed at my rother the other day, who is 54, when he said he hadn't done it yet. The vaccine side effects do suck but so what."
16993,I had my first shingles break out 12 days ago. I finish my antivirals today. Singles are in my groin and down my thigh. Definitely not a mild case. Most areas have scabbed over but the stinging nerve pain is still a big issue. They also gave me gabapentin and oxy We have a camping trip planned this weekend and I Am so nervous. 41f mom of 3 2 dogs and a husband that helps. Its my oldest kids birthday so its a pretty big deal to cancel. I will have help if I need but I Am so nervous that I Am just going to be miserable. We leave in 2 days. Will I heal enough to be okay? Or am I crazy to be going? I Am sick of feeling sick and just want to live my dang life.
16994,Got shingles after spending time with vaccine and boosted family
16995,Shingles vaccine under 50?: Thanks for this post. I am about to start demanding i get the vaccine as I am on now my 5th shingles outbreak since August. I also suspect i have EDS and hope my Gastroenterolist might be able to help me on a path to get diagnosed. I am 42f and currently having zero life due to constant shingles. August. January. May. June now twice as new rash appeared just as last lot cleared and this time its on both sides of my face. I am so confused and beyond frustrated. I wish you well.
16996,"Moderna booster shot and fatigue: Following my Moderna booster shot, I have been feeling extremely fatigued and lethargic. It's been a week since I got the shot, and I still struggle to find the energy to do even simple daily tasks. I've never experienced this level of exhaustion before, and it's starting to worry me. Has anyone else felt this drained after their Moderna booster shot? I'm wondering if this is a normal reaction or if I should seek medical advice."
16997,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: He is doing well now but I swear he was traumatized by the whole thing. He brings it up a lot like he cannot help but think about it all the time. He says it is one of the most painful things he is experienced. We were at a summer cookout and he was joking about how he got all these weird bug bites and asking everyone else why he was the only one who got bit then when they got worse and worse he went to the doctor and found out it was shingles. It was mainly on his face and he could not sleep because it was too painful to touch. Poor guy.
16998,So I 22F have been having health issues for a few years now. I was diagnosed with the following GERD IBS and PCOS. I Have been treating the PCOS with hormones and symptom management for the GERD and IBS. In the last three months I have had skin lesions and abscesses on multiple occasions as well as colds stomach viruses and random fevers. The first time nobody diagnosed the rash as anything and it took 3 or 4 antibiotics to treat. The second time I was told it was shingles and sent on my way until it exploded all over my legs and then they sent out a culture and it came back as MRSA. I have not been exposed to anyone who is sick. I Have been having terrible stomach aches and pain and headaches on and off since the first one and zofranpeptotums do not seem to help. My doc says to just ride it out but I cannot be sick anymore its exhausting.
17005,: I have been to the ER twice in the past year from sudden loss of vision and really high blood pressure. I never know when my bp will spike now otherwise it is normal. They call it a TIA but can find no clogged vessels or cardiovascular issues. My daughter has had strange continuous clots with irregular menstrual cycling. My son is having all kinds of problems pain in left side diastolic blood pressure in high 90's. Has been to ER and had many tests with no diagnosis. We were all healthy before being vaccinated
17006,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: so not 18 but close. My boyfriend got shingles suddenly at 25 with no notice. He and I were both under extreme stress after moving to a new area and he got a weird rash. He waited a day or so thinking it would get better and then finally it kept spreading rapidly. When he went to the doctor the doctor said it can appear suddenly under periods of extreme stress. But we were shocked because he never even had chickenpox before. the doctor thought he was exposed but it never activated until he was under extreme stress again. He said it felt like his skin was on fire. Now anytime he is extremely stressed he breaks out in hives. It is not the shingles itself but it is like his skin freaks out. It is crazy how the body remembers holds onto things like that.
17007,Would you get your child the hpv vaccine? Have any of you personally or known someone personally that has had an adverse reaction?: I had it when I was 20. It was 3 needles over months. At the end of the course I was diagnosed with a 23cm cyst coming out of my ovary and my doctor said it was from the HPV vaccine. I needed emergency surgery and lost my ovary. If I could go back I would not get it.
17013,Rinvoqacneshingles: Have those who suffered acne gotten the shingles vaccine prior to starting Rinvoq? I got acne after starting rinvoq and the shingles shot after starting rinvoq? I am not entirely sure what the question or info you are trying to collect is though haha.
17015,I just took my first dose like 3 mins ago I Am so excited but so nervous I drank a bunch of water and ate 2 egg whites with an Oikos protein yogurt. I hope I do not get sick
17019,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I took the shingles COVID and flu shot all at the same time. I was just like ""Have at me bro!"" I don't remember feeling too bad more than a day so. I was kind of like ""f it, just deal with the pain all at once, but maybe they kind of cancelled each other out?"
17021,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Got it twice once at 26 and again at 52. Pretty painful both times so the vaccine shots did not hurt at all.
17023,Reactivated viruses while on DMT?: I was diagnosed with MS in Aug 2019. Put on Gilenya Nov 2019. Developed Macular Oedema in Mar 2020. Shingles on my lower back in April. Shingles behind my right eye in May causing Acute Retinal Necrosis and permanent total loss of vision in this eye. Was hospitalised taken off Gilenya placed on Tecfidera and antivirals. Will be on Valacyclovir life long to ensure no more Shingles. Was unable to have vaccine for Shingles when I was placed on Gilenya as it was a live vaccine at that time. I have recently had the current vaccine for it as it is not live. Never want to get Shingles again
17024,Had the second shingles shot: Thank you for sharing this I got shingles on my 48th birthday and it was truly the worst pain I Have experienced in my life. I did not know what it was and did not catch it on time for antivirals. In retrospect I was lucky I had the traditional presentation on my torso. For reference I have birthed three babies without medical intervention aka no pain killers. It also completely derailed my life for a solid month made it extremely challenging to worklive. I share this to say that the vaccine is worth it. Ill get it next year when I turn 50 and like other vaccines it will knock me flat for a couple days most likely because I typically react that way. But the knowledge that I may never get it again in my life will be priceless
17025,Shingles vaccine: Bells Palsy sucks as does shingles
17029,First flare questions: Acute shingles lasts through at least week 35 then subacute until week 12. Just because the rash is healing does not mean your nerve pathways are fine yet. You need to rest as much as you can and to lower your stress as much as possible and that will make it the most unlikely that you will develop any permanent symptoms. Any stress mental or physical or emotional of any sickness or vaccine can because shingles. Personally I got it after getting actual covid while the vaccine was fine. I hope you feel better soon
17031,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Highly recommend following the low residue diet beforehand! If you don't, and go the traditional prep route, my additional advice is to coat your bottom in Desitin before you start prep. It will keep you from chafing and getting irritated."
17038,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I am so sorry and hope you are on the mend soon. I 63F got one shot a year ago and never went back for the second and came down with shingles at Christmas. I am just finally getting back to normal and still have some sensitivity where it started. My husband went out and got his first shot the day after he saw my rash. I urge everyone to get both shots.
17040,Preventing shingles recurrance: Fortunately it hasn't affected my hearing in that ear. I asked my doctor if there was some product that would numb the inside of my ear because it will drop me to my knees when it zings me. There is not a product that will do that. I'm on Gabapentin and have actually felt some relief. Pain is still there but waaay less.
17043,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My friend got it on her neck and in her ear and it caused Bells palsy on one side of her face. Her face is permanently damaged from it like she had a mild stroke. Scared the shit out of me and I got it as soon as I turned 50. Terrible stuff
17044,It was painful. I am dreading the second dose. I had the tdap last week and felt little. I was told the shingles hurts because its viscous.
17046,Shingles vaccine: I Have had shingles twice. Once when I was young. 22. Very painful. Had it again in my late 50s. Not so painful but left scars. Took a vaccine after that and was told I was forever protected. Now I have to get 2 more shots??
17049,Shingles Is NO Joke: I had a boss who went blind from the virus resting on her optic nerve. She spent 72 hours literally SCREAMING in pain. It was so bad the ER could not do anything without sedating her with Propofol. By the time they figured out what it was she was blind. You are right it is absolutely no joke Pro tip If a cold sore ever extends to the tip of the nose that is a big red flag and you should go to the ER immediately.
17051,Shingles vaccine: Same to shingles before 50 then chills aches with the vaccine but shingles is the WORST get the vaccine OP
17054,Shingles vaccine: Get it I had a mild case of shingles before I got the vaccine and it was awful.
17056,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I lucked out and had virtually no reaction just a sore arm both times. Fingers crossed for you
17057,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Mine too. I have MECFS now because of it. Irreparably harmed me for life.
17058,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I got it at 29 on the back of my scalp. One of the worst months of my life. I cannot even imagine what you went through.
17061,I actually got the Shingles shot many years ago and then I got Shingles There is a newer version that my Dr wanted me to get I Passed
17062,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: I have and I did not have any problems. I rarely have any reaction to vaccines except for some soreness at the injection site. My friend is a nurse who took care of several shingles patients and this is nothing anyone should suffer from. Just my 2 cents
17063,Hi everyone This group has been incredibly helpful during the past 2 weeks. I had robotic assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovary removal on 719. I am 51yo and did not have babies. I am one of the 0.3 that was born with Uterine Didelphys I had 2 uterus 2 cervix. I stayed overnight at the hospital and the worst part was the catheter. It was not draining properly and the pressure in my bladder was excruciating. Thankfully they removed it at 1am instead of waiting until later. Two days after I returned home my abdomen broke out in a rash. Turns out I had a reaction to the presurgical scrub the steri strips and the surgical glue used to close my 3 incisions. I was put on a 6 day Medrol dose pack and finished those 48 hours ago. Ice Benadryl and the steroids helped and my incisions are a still a little pissed and itchy but others good. This morning I woke up with a weird ache in the left side of my labia. I discovered a small cluster of blisters and called my doctor. I was seen this afternoon and I Am now being treated for vulvar shingles. Not the most common place to get shingles. I was prescribed Valtrex and lidocaine ointment. I Am using frozen water bottles wrapped in a towel to ice. I Am sharing my unique experience hoping to help someone who may find themselves with a strange blisterrash on their labia as there are few posts or I was searching the wrong words. Our bodies are weird and interesting and the things that I Have experienced are nothing what I expected before surgery. Until the shingles outbreak the two worst parts of the entire experience had been the Foley catheter and the allergic reaction. I only took narcotics for 2 days for pain although I Am debating taking them now so I can sleep. To everyone who has shared their experiences thank you Its been reassuring to know I Am not alone during this recovery even if my journey is a little bumpy. To anyone getting ready for surgery you got this
17069,Shingles with PHN after: Maybe this will help someone... I got shingles in May 2024. Recurrence right now and have severe PHN. From shoulder blade up to top of skull complete misery and excruciating pain. I just read about 10 articles on PHN and the one that struck me was about Vitamin C and PHN Best results apparently are IV vs. pills. Have not done that yet but I am going to. In the meantime I ordered lyposome Vitamin C apparently absorbs better. Ironically I am in an airport and cannot get the pills or anything so I chugged 2 orange juices and just ate a bowl of fresh fruit. Took a 300mg Gabapentin which typically does not touch this pain and in 30 min I feel 50 better. Still have pain but I do not want to scream. No clue if this works but it is an easy thing to try.
17070,Waiting to get my shingles vaccine pls CongratsLikeImFive: Oh no Sorry to hear that Luckily I had no bad side effects
17071,Shingles vaccine: I did after getting shingles at 55.
17076,We went to visit my husbands grandparents and his grandmother kissed my baby on the cheek I was in shock she even did it. Its been two days and this morning its 5am where I Am at his nose is stuffy and he has a little cough. I am stressed out because I Am worried it may be RSV is it a such thing as to early to get him checked out? I know I Am probably being paranoid but I just cannot shake the thought that she kissed him and now hes getting sick. He got a RSV vaccine a month ago I Am hoping that makes a difference if he does have RSV. How do you address this with grandparents?? I do not want to sound rude but I really do not care when it comes to the health of my children EDIT I DID NOT SAY SHE MADE HIM SICK I can understand the idea that it could have come from anywhere. I said I may be being paranoid but I Am not ruling her kissing him in his face out and I Am not agreeing with the idea its okay for a adult to kiss someone infant especially without permission if its odd so be it Ill die on that hill  My children do not go to school or daycare and we have been in the house other than to visit family just recently and to run small errands. My husband has not been out of the house hes a construction union worker and things have been slow so hes been home.
17080,Despite the temporary pain I still took the shingles vaccine because getting it is horrible.
17081,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: The day after the first shot was a rough one for me
17085,Enough with the scare tactics. Nobody is going to believe this garbage for a 2nd time. Monkey pox is not an issue its really shingles as a side effect from the c19 vaccine Remember its in the trial data information.
17091,First got flu vaccine in the Army before deployments. Always made me sick as a dog. Since retiring from the military I have not taken it again. Got talked into shingles vaccine though by VA doc. So far so good but I do not feel protected against shingles in the least
17092,Shingles Sucks: I got shingles unvaccinated in my late 30's. It was not too bad but quite annoying and painful for a couple weeks.
17096,Honey I did not get monkeypox from hot gay sex I got shingles from the vaccine
17103,Sore arm 1 week after Gardasil?: Yes I did not have leep but I have CIN 1 and I thought it would not hurt to get it. My arm did the same thing
17105,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Hey can I ask what post hepatic neuralgia feels like? I got shingles for the first time back in 2018 and afterwards I never felt good again... feeling body pain like I am running a fever but do not actually have one and random itching in the spot where I got the first rash which is on the scar from where I had surgery to repair a broken leg and ankle. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have basically been told I am not really in that much pain. I also have EhlerDanlos so i do not know honestly how the hell other people feel but I struggle to get out of bed almost every day.
17108,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I had in my armpit and it drove me crazy it was quite painful.
17110,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I remember having chicken pox myself also possibly the chicken pox vaccine a bit later but it was bundled with school vaccines. I am not sure why I got the vaccine if that was the case.
17111,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Its more unpleasant for adults but only a higher risk to expectant mothers. The get it over with mentality had nothing to do with concern for the childrens future health. The idea was to make sure the kids caught it at a time convenient to the parents rather than risking the random chance of them maybe getting chickenpox before a planned holiday or other event. I Am over 60 and have never had chickenpox. I did get vaccinated when the vaccine became available though.
17118,I hope you feel better. I got the vaccine 2 years ago and yes I felt the side effects. But they were NOTHING compared to when I got shingles in my late 30s. Trust me you did the right thing by getting vaccinated
17120,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Had shingles on my scalp face and in my eye on the cornea. Was hospitalized for eight days because they did not know what was wrong with me did a lumbar puncture and there was blood in the spinal fluid. I lost my humanity at one time screaming and trying to claw my eye out with my fingers. Dilaudid did not touch the pain. I had a red hot iron stuck to my face and scalp and boiling acid pouring into my eye. Only escape from it was when I passed out from exhaustion. On day 6 an infectious disease specialist and eye specialist came in took one look at me and said shingles in unison. Started me on massive intravenous antivirals and cortisone. By this time I had a pic line because my veins were done. It was like a miracle how fast the rash started going away. I was out of critical care and home in two days. I was in a dark room in bed for three months basically homebound for six. Now I have nerve damage on that side of my face. For a couple years the pain was almost as bad as shingles. A pain specialist team helped so much. It has been three years and while I am not completely well medical marijuana helps tremendously.
17122,What vaccines were you offered before starting a bcell depleter?: I had to get another hep B vaccine before starting Ocrevus because my blood test showed that I was apparently a nonresponder. Shingles RSV and pneumonia were not discussed. I was only 22 at the time.
17123,Shingles vaccine experience: The worst reaction to the second shingles vaccine is better than any episode of shingles.
17131,"Friend has shingles on his scalp.: My friend was diagnosed today with shingles. He has them on his scalp under his hair. Three days ago I spent a few hours playing board games, eating pizza, and having some beers with him. He said on that day he had noticed a small rash on his head but didn't think much of it until yesterday when he noticed a larger rash, began to get a headache, and get itchy. I have never been vaccinated or had chickenpox(I'm 31 years old, male, and currently healthy). What are the chances I am now infected? Should I go to the doctor and get tested?"
17136,RSV vaccine: I am in southwestern WA and my baby got this a couple weeks ago. The state had just approved giving them out. I would ask your doctor if they ran out or have not gotten it yet? Or they may be priorizing certain patients my 2 month old about to start daycare was high priority.
17137,Is it herpes zoster?: they usually blister at some point i assume the chest rash is close to the arm. if you look at a dermatone map it could be in the same nerve. When i had shingles there was no itching the radiating pain was like a jolt upon touching it mines was slightly different since i allowed it to fully blister and it bursted. is there any sensation on the arm or chest. continue taking the antivirals.
17139,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: Everyone I have ever spoken to that did not get the vaccine and then got shingles said it was one of the worst if not the worst experience of their life. The nerve pain is almost unbearable. My dad got the vaccine and he still got it but it was mild. Even then he said it sucked. Get the shot.
17141,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I had shingles on 2013 due to my immune system being messed up after chemo. It was so bed I had to be hospitalized for a week. Covered most of my left side from my buttocks down to my ankle. Still suffering with nerve pain and nerve entrapment on my ankle.
17143,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: Vaccines are different for everyone but anecdotally I am immunocompromised and I just got the shingles vaccine at 30 I did not think it was horrible just took it easy and took Tylenol for a sore arm Not a bad experience at all and i definitely do not want to get shingles
17150,Response when asked if HPV vaccine should be taken.: Was not there some issue with people having really bad reactions to the first HPV vaccine I remember one of my friends kids having a pretty serious reaction that kept them from getting the followup shots. People seem to remember stuff like this forever but do not pay attention to the fact that they release updated versions of things to fix problems found in previous versions.
17153,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Same with as far as scarring. I was out for 6 weeks from the scabs in my face. I worked day to day with clients and my mgr gave me hell for not returning after a couple of weeks since I was not contagious. I showed up to show her what I looked like. She told me to home and I got short term disability for it.
17154,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: I had shingles at age 35. Cleared up pretty quickly but the nerve pain was off and on for a few months after
17156,COVID jab gives shinglesthen take the Shingrix jab to cure itShingrix jab causes neuropathy demyelinating neuropathywhat started out as compliance led to a rash which led to brain damage your doneMerck stopped producing vaccine in 2020 switched over to Shingrix.
17157,"Under 35 with Shingles?!!!: 33 here, just got diagnosed yesterday. My doctor didn't seem surprised at all! It affects people with weakened immune systems, which is why it's typically seen in older people as their immune system weakens. But stuff like stress can also weaken the immune system and trigger it too! I've also been going through some physically and mentally stressful events in my life, so that's probably what got me too."
17161,Shingles with UCD?: That sucks so much I am so sorry. I hope it goes away quickly. My GI actually did not tell me to get any vaccine besides the flu and to watch out for my son when he gets live vaccine vaccines. My rheum a to logi st was the one who recommended the Shingles vaccine and Prev nar. The shingles vaccine knocked me on my as s.
17163,Shingles vaccine: It was terrible for me shot 1 but shot 2 was a breeze in comparison. Still worth it to me. My mom told me about someone she knew having shingles internally and I looked it up and yeah it is a thing. And I knew someone that has near miss for eye damage blindness based on the location. Glad I got the vaccine.
17164,Shingles vaccine experience: My arm was really sore for a couple of days and I had bad chills for a night. Ill take that over debilitating nerve pain any day. I had an uncle who was tough as an ox and shingles just about broke him mentally.
17168,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: The pain was beyond anything I had maybe sepsis? It was akin to sepsis pain that I had when I was having cancer treatment. I am pretty tough about pain live with severe chronic pain and I was screaming at the top of my lungs. My whole lower back to the left into my groin. I had a weeping groin wound for months could not wear underwear nothing. Worst thing beyond the chemo for an unrelated bone marrow transplant and sepsis that I have gone through pain wise.
17169,"Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes, witness me!: My second was nothing. My first just made me tired. My wife was pissed that I ""passed out"" after work and we didn't go to dinner. Had to remind her like 7x that I had a shingles shot."
17172,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: you should be My wife experienced something similar recently and the state of WA is supposed to cover it as preventative. I cannot recall if she ever got it covered but it was a PITA I am not really looking forward to them when I start HRT it is the ewwphoria thing where it is eww and oh yeah I am a woman now. The process sounds horrible though.
17173,"Preventing shingles recurrance: I got shingles in my ear, face and mouth on the right side. It's been a living hell. Blisters are all healed up and gone but the nerve pain remains and is insane."
17174,Shingles Sucks: I got it too in my 30s after a crazy week of little sleep and doing a lot and my immune system was low. Felt like an icepick to my temple for a few days. Then faded away. Not fun but somewhat bearable. I am just afraid it hits harder when we are older.
17176,41 and got Shingles: Had them twice. First round happened at 29 shortly before my first MS relapse which led to my diagnosis. Second one gave me muscle spasms in my left leg and foot. Mostly not noticeable now two years later but rock climbing shoes in particular can set off some gnarly foot cramps.
17177,I took my first and only does of Rituximab at the end of November 2024. I had a really bad reaction super rare by the way so do not be scared to take it if its your first time so my neurologist is going to be starting me on Mavenclad in March. No vaccines were ordered before Rituximab but they were for the Mavenclad. I Am taking the flu shot pneumoccocal Tetanus even though I just got the TDAP booster two years ago? and maybe one other ALL on Tuesday as well as a TB skin test. Ill be taking the Shingles vaccine as well later on. I guess I Am just nervous to be getting all of these vaccines at once hahaha. I Am new to having MS and its mostly my autonomic nervous system that is affected and I Am just nervous about having crazy side effects. I am also nervous because I just had Rituximab like two months ago so would not all my B cells still be depleted? I do not know anything about science haha. Also I Am saying this as someone who is very pro vaccine I know they are important and I Am going to get them no matter what I Am just nervous and looking to hear how other peoples experiences went.
17182,when I was a baby I got a bad fever from one of the shots and my mother had to tell them not to proceed and I had shingles where the nuns put my feet in warm water in primary school. I blame the vaccine.
17186,Several friends have reported nasty side effects after the new shingles vaccine. I had the one dose only several years ago with no problems.
17187,Shingles vaccine experience: 52 year old. Two shots of Shinrex over 6 months. No issues. The mild immune response.
17189,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I was just a hair too young to get the chickenpox vaccine. Got chickenpox at 3 or 4 still have a scar above my eyebrow from it. Then I got shingles at 14. It was awful. The whole nerve from the center of my check down to my left elbow felt like it was on fire and it lasted for I think two weeks. There were faint white scars on my chest until I was probably in my late twenties and I am 31 now. Cannot wait till they let me get the vaccine. I would not wish that on anyone.
17190,All of May there was the rash area and after the pain went away and rash started healing new blisters appeared on the abdomen neck and shoulder areas. Just itching again now no pain. Does this mean the original infection never went away? There was a weeks course of Valtrax in May. Do we need another Valtrax course again for this new outbreak or is it part of the same and Valtrax will not help? This left no time and room to get the vaccine. The doctor said you should be immune for a year so you do not need to rush the vaccine. What gives?
17191,Shingles vaccine: I had both with no side effects other than the usual sore arm. I also had a mild case of shingles 9 years ago and do not want that again.
17193,3rd loading dose done having new reaction: I Am having a breakout on my face. Forehead. Red  now bloody. Size of a dime. And I Have never had this. It almost looks like shingles. I Have been vaccinated for shingles. Going to doctor tomorrow. I Have had one dose of Skyrizi.
17199,I am currently 9 days into my shingles journey. I have it on the face. Pain is stabby electricshock like in my temples ear canal and head. My doc said I cannot get the vaccine because I am under 50. However I see the CVS will let me get it because I am immunecompromised wink. Should I get it even while I am currently experiencing shingles? My rash is all scabbed over but the pain remains. Again I am about 910 days in since I saw the rash. My doc did not prescribe antivirals since we caught it about 67 days in.
17200,I did not have a problem with either shingles shot except for soreness. It was gone within a day.
17201,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I remember growing up my mother caught it in her 30's and it nearly killed her she was sick for weeks. Shingles is a nasty disease.
17203,Shingles and other Vaccines: People do not want to do the research. About ANYTHING. Much less even be able to write as much as you did. Fear based anything is not good. Yes. I have had shingles. A bad case. And I had chicken pox and whatever vaccines they were dishing out in childhood. The profit based science or? It is interesting what people believe
17204,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got mine around 35 weeks and it was a breeze. I had zero side effects not even a sore arm. Baby continued moving like normal and I am currently 383 and things are well so far. Very happy I got the vaccine with a winter baby on the way. RSV kills infants.
17205,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: She was vaccinated and still got it? Is shingles a possible side effect of the vaccine? I would like to see some studies from a neutral party.
17206,Shingles vaccine experience: I got the MMR vaccine and STILL got the mumps. 
17208,Got my 2nd shingles shot today. All the same side effects as the 1st shot ThisIs50
17214,a previous post made monkeyP look just like shingles. shingles is a side effect of the jab my brother got shingles fully vaccinated and his doctor said... we have a vaccine for that
17216,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I have a broken immune system and did not have any reaction to either shingle shot. As for the other I have been getting those since my teens. There are far worse things out there. Good luck
17222,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Just got back from seeing my doctor. She said it was very odd to her and all the doctors she spoke to at the clinic. She also checked the CDC database and could not find any instances of it causing shingles right away in someone who is not immune. She thought it should have manifested as a weak version of chicken pox if anything because my lab work came back with 0 immunity to it prior to my vaccine. She prescribed me Gabapentin and said the rash is already starting to clear up and pain should hopefully stop in 46 weeks.
17224,female age 23. 4 days ago had 1 little bump on neck that i thought was a bug bite. scratched it a bit. put some scented hand sanitizer on it thinking that would stop the itching I am dumb. then this pops up. at first my mom thinks shingles but i go to my primary care physician who says not shingles here is some prednisone. i took the first dose tuesday and my 3rd dose this morning. the rash appears to be getting worse photos show progression as well all the suspected culprit. it does cross the midline of my body but my mom is still worried it is shingles. any ideas?
17225,A case of reactivation of varicellazoster virus in a 27 year old male. we describe a case of itchy papulovesicular rash which is consistent with shingles reactivation following PfizermRNA vaccine second dose.
17226,Medical history that I know of for my mom 59f overweight but otherwise in decent health. Hypoglycemia and IBS and I think high cholesterol are the only things I know of that she is been diagnosed with. I put a picture in the comment but not sure if that is allowed so Ill do my best to describe it my mom has these white almost crusted spots on her left eye that have gotten worse and now her eye is severely swollen. Not sure if its related but she is also had a headache for the last 4 days. She drove to my house this morning to watch my son and was really queasy when she got here and needed to lay down. I took her BP thinking it would be low but its 14590 which is not normal for her. I sent a picture to my friend who is a dermatologist and he said it could be shingles she is had the chickenpox as a child. I made her an appointment with urgent care because her doctor does not see patients today. Can urgent care help with this? I Am worried about her. If it is shingles can she spread it to my son? Hes 17 months old and has only had 1 of the 2 chickenpox vaccines so far. He climbed up on her lap this morning to give her a Mothers Day gift but was not kissed and did not touch her eye. I Am kind of freaking out. What kind of decontamination can I even do if she was laying on my couch? She also is currently still at my home and waiting for my dad to get here because I do not want her driving herself.
17227,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: 39f  Canada. I got tested for HPV first to make sure I did not have it. Had to pay out of pocket for that which is weird  Pap tests are free and covered but tests for the virus that specifically causes abnormal Pap tests are not covered I only work part time so do not have health insurance thru work and its not covered under my provincial coverage. Paid 220 shot x 3 shots but feel like 660 is not a lot to pay to help prevent future potential cancer. I know too many people my age getting cancers from HPV now. Throat cancer cervical cancer Get it. Before RFK makes vaccines too hard to get.
17231,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Pox at 4 bad case of shingles at 19
17232,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Had it in my late 20s luckily got on antiviral medication the next day which helped. I just got my vaccine a few months ago at 50
17233,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Truly no joke lost the majority of sight in my right eye to shingles. Sudden massive attack in 24hrs. It usually causes cataracts but I ended up with cornea damage. GET VACCINATED PEOPLE
17235,When I made an appointment on clic sante a few weeks ago there was only an age requirement born after April. I was trying to reschedule at a different point service and there is an additional requirement that baby is 5 kg. Wondering if anyone has been turned away for being under 5 kilos? The other point service I originally made an apt at did not have the weight requirement. Edit we got the shot at point service Lachine. They have both doses for under and above 5 kg.
17238,RSV Vaccine: My baby got beyfortus at 4 days old and had no reaction. The pediatrician said there is generally zero side effects because it is antibodies rather than a vaccine.
17239,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: There is something wrong if you get shingles that much. There is also something wrong with your doctors advice. I notice you have a new account. Please stop spreading misinformation. That is not how shingles works.
17242,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles at 16 not long after my BCG jab i have survived this far without a vaccine for shingles so i doubt its really needed.
17247,Shingles vaccine experience: Ironically I have Shingles right now. For the goddamn FIFTEENTH TIME. Nausea fever swollen lymph nodes and of course the blisters. I get it on the palm of my hand so I can t drive use a computer keyboard or anything where I have to crunch up my hand. Thankfully I can type on a phone. It suu you uck s but I can t get the vaccine yet because it s not FDA approved for people under 50. I m 48. Sigh.
17248,Do Not get that shot my brother did he got sick n then got shingles 3 x
17252,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Is that what they call Dying on Stage?
17253,Its the shingles side FX of the Covid vaccine
17258,V glad to get second Shingrix vaccine yesterday. Life is tricky enough right now with left arm out of action in splint
17267,Shingles vaccine at 27?: Get it. I Have had shingles twice. Bad once minor second time. I wish I had gotten the vaccine.
17268,TO BE HONEST I am not sure why this is happening. I did take my shot a little close to my belly button but I am all fluff. but the next day the right side on my waist band the skin feels like third degree burns but it LOOKS fine. Did I knick something? I am on 2m ozempic and started 10 months ago. Been on 2 for a couple months. Or do I have like shingles or cancer or something It is been over a week and I am not willing to go to my terrible nurse to ask as I do not even have a car right now and would take months to get in probably Anyone have anything similar? it did spread around to my back on the right side a bit. Its painful to push on too.
17269,Luckily I got It on my arm but this constant burning sensation is horrible. It drives me crazy. I am not taking meds because I caught it too late and cannot do the vaccine at 26. I hope it is just the worst state right now.
17271,Shingles vaccine experience: It seems that everyone reacts differently to vaccinations. I never get any reactions at all. When I got my shingles vaccine a few years ago I got it at the same time as my flu shot and covid vaccine. No reaction at all. My wife mother and other people I know all get some sort of mild symptoms from vaccinations. So I guess YMMV.
17273,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Fingers crossed the diet helps. How much mg Lysine did you take daily? I never had a rash and I Am still not 100 sure if I had Shingles but 95 all the symptoms but a rash. Now months of PHN. Doctors have ruled out serious stuff but not very helpful in diagnosis. Never had anti virals but I guess that is more so for the rash anyway. Good to know Just realized I have so many nut and seed products. I Have just cut it all out. Sesame being one So crazy how that affected you. Did you ever feel like a non burning pain? Sometimes it just feels like normal deep pain but most of the time it is a burning pain. I Am so sick of it.
17277,RSV Shot opinions: I got the flu shot and covid booster no side affects. No site soreness or anything I plan to get the rsv shot and antibodies shot if they offer it. I have seen what serious rsv cases look like.... nooooo thanks
17278,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Hang in there. It took me about a week and a half to get back to normal. I like you had a temperature fatigue chills for 2 to 3 days and then dizziness that lasted about a week and a half.
17280,31 yr old male: Oh man That looks painful. Mine was not that big but it wraps around my waist. And you are spot on its one of the worst pains and I can handle pain. I Am three weeks out and my neck still hurts so bad that I can barely stand it. I Have read that is where the virus hunkers down in the nerves coming off the spine. neck is where a lot of people get the pain. Once I started the oral antivirals as well as topical antivirals the blistering itself started to heal. But neck pain is still horrible. So sorry you are also going through this. I had not ever even thought about shingles and thought it was just a rashI was sadly mistaken and my eyes are now open. I do not wish this on anyone. I really hope you find relief and start healing.
17286,Shingles vaccine?: I got the shingles vaccine because I got shingles and had to spend a few days in ICU. I got it on my face and in my mouth. I am under 50. Hopefully now I will not get shingles like that again. It was horrible.
17287,Shingles Vaccine: I had my first dose the same time as flu and was miserable for about 36hrs. Second dose was just shingles and less impact. Healthy spouse had shingles alone and both doses had flu like symptoms for ~24 hrs.
17292,Recently on vacation missed a dose of my weekly injection and the following week I got back on schedule but my hunger seems to still be there where before missing that one dose I was never hungry Anyone else experiencing this? I even increased from 1015 units to 20 units yesterday Still much more appetite than before Its my second dose since missing the one dose
17295,I have been trying for over a month at this point and I keep getting we are looking in too it with no commitment. I have explained I am immune compromised as is my husband they can see on my record when I was admitted to THAT hospital when I had my allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine AND the medical I was given to treat it . And all my other various health issues. I plan to mask the whole time and I purchased a small HEPA filter that will be easier to hide than the bigger one I had. I have heard fans are allowed so I am going to try to pass it off at a fancy fan. I do have a portable HEPA for my stroller when we can leave. I am mostly concerned about my baby. Covid RSV Norovirus measles and who knows what else is still floating around right now. Why is this so hard?
17297,Has anyone tried Varicella Zoster Vaccine?: I took two dose of var i vaccine in December January when I had constant ob for six months. It seems that it takes a few months to take effect but my symptoms decreased and I am now ob free since March not even a tingle. You have to stay off antivirals and you can have four dose if two are not enough. The most difficult is to find a doctor who will let you try.
17304,Baby sick with RSV 9 months  sick kids on: There Is a different RSV vaccine for pregnant people. It was not available when I was pregnant so I got my baby the vaccine at public health. She was so sad and I said I wish I got the one for pregnant people so my baby did not need to get this but the nurse said the one for babies is better. I did not really look into it though.
17308,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I would JUMP at the chance I had shingles when I was 26 and it was fucking horrible. Not only is shingles horrible enough as is but I got postherpetic neuralgia from it which means it damaged the nerves in my leg and even after it was gone I spent about a year and a half needing a cane afterwards because of leg weakness and was in constant pain. If you have the chance to get the vaccine that seems wonderful I would not wish shingles on anyone.
17310,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I had this happen at 6. They were taking advantage of the fact that chicken pox is way easier when you are young and you are probably going to get it eventually regardless. Contracting chicken pox as an adult is dangerous. My cousin got it in his 20s and got pox on his eyes and in his throat. For me it was just I felt itchy for a few days.
17311,I am not asking for a diagnosis. I am asking if anyone else's experience was like that i.e. no blisters flat red and brown dots a few on the other side of the body. My doctor is treating it as shingles.
17313,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I have had them in my groin area and it was horrible. Started out as some unexplained soreness in the area. Then bam Full blown shingles. Took a couple of weeks or so to fully cure but the really bad pain was only for a few days.
17315,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: How long do you have genital warts?
17318,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Horrible for both. But still better than getting shingles. Just do it and take the day off afterward. Strong vaccine reactions are considered a good thing because it means your body is mounting an antibody response immediately. I have horrible reactions to most vaccines the worst ever being a live virus typhoid vaccine.
17320,First Time w Shingles really struggling: I am so sorry hope you find some combo of things that help you get through this Hopefully it will be a frightening memory instead of daily reality SOON I do not know how tough I am and certainly do not feel tough I just know Shingles on my torso was agony I did not even experience what you are experiencing right now. I did have an infected cyst on a tonsil recently and it was HORRIBLE just agonizing. It even sent me to the ER when I was struggling to swallow was scared breathing would be next STILL awful as that was and it totally was affecting nerves in my ears and jaw it was not as painful as Shingles... Shingles SUCKS
17325,THE 39TRIPLEDEMIC39... Should Parents be Worried? RSVFluCovid Dr. Paul Retired Pediatrician: My daughter got flu A and strep throat at the same time over Christmas break. It was a mess her fevers were so high.
17326,RSV vaccine: I had both Tdap and RSV. No symptoms other than swollen arm. I highly suggest getting them both
17328,Hey all I Am female 23 and just been diagnosed with shingles today and getting antivirals tomorrow. Got sent home from work and so far I have a small patch on my back and some tingling and the beginnings in a new rash on the front same side of the body  do not feel too rotten otherwise at the minute only the rash area feels like someone holding a lighter up to my body  like a burn  and some spots of the rash I feel the pain going deep into my nerve. In you guys experience is this going to get much worse even if I start the tablets? I Am so scared
17329,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom was friends with a pediatrician and he urged her to get me the vaccine when it came out. I think I was 10 or 11. She scheduled it and I got chicken pox between then and the appointment lol. Never knew who I got it from. I got strep throat simultaneously so was absolutely miserable.
17331,Shingles Vaccine: I had a Shingrix jab before having Lemtrada. Felt nothing.
17332,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles about 18 years ago. I had them on my face. I do know that my eyesight got worse when I had them but the worst part was the pain like a dry sun burn that just would not heal. Was given a steroid and cream. Went away after a month. Scars stayed for a couple months. I was in my mod twenties and going through child custody case and was told mine was brought on by stress. I recommend the vaccine to all.
17334,Shingles vaccine experience: Just got it a little over a month ago  i am 49 so cannot get a shot. It was one of the most excruciatingly painful things I have ever experienced. I feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance but 4 nights of feeling like I was being tortured with electricity was the absolute pits And for some reason it was only at night all night  so much horseshit lol
17336,First time: Oh no I am so sorry you are going through this and with 2 little ones no less. Yikes Well everything I read said that babies and pregnant women were the most at risk from contracting the pox virus from someone who has shingles. So I stayed home. Hopefully you can stay somewhere else for a few days while the blusters are out. Once they start to dry up and crust over then you should no longer be contagious but definitely speak to your primary doctor to make sure. I would keep them covered and maybe not handle the kiddos if possible. It is a tough spot to be in for sure. Take the meds after you eat to avoid the stomach issues and drink a ton of water. The meds will help even if it is pass the 72 hour mark. For me the rash showed up on a Sunday and did not get diagnosed and start taking meds till Thursday. I believe the meds help with drying up the blisters because they did nothing for the pain. Tomorrow will be 2 weeks since the rash first appeared and the blisters are dried up and going away not fast enough for me though and the nerve pain is not as bad. Thank the LORDT The nerve pain was the worst part of having shingles for me. My doc did not prescribe pain killers so I popped Aleve and 800 mg of ibuprofen pills like tic tacs but just ended upsetting my stomach more so I stopped. I tried CBD gummies and cream but did not get the relief I was hoping for. Although the cream was nice because it had a cooling minty affect which helped calm the nerve pain for a little while. I have read in other posts some people use Aspercream which has helped them. There are a few natural remedies I did I believed helped. I drank apple cider vinegar tea 3x a day started taking llysine supplements daily and ate mostly fruits and veggies along with drinking at least 12 gallon a day. Like I said tomorrow will be 2 weeks and the pain is nearly gone maybe feel like 5 and it is a faint flicker fire pain which I am so grateful for. I really attribute the ACV tea for this since it has inflammatory and boost immunity properties. Definitely do some research especially if you are still breast feeding talk to your doctor and rest as much as possible. I wish you the best of luck. May the odds be in your favor that you heal quickly so you can be 100 for your kiddos.
17340,RSV vaccine preterm labor risk?: I got all the vaccines offered to me and was induced and then had a c section when labor stalled during my 37th week for preeclampsia. My baby is super healthy.
17343,Shingles and other Vaccines: I have never gotten a reaction from a vaccine shotdose and I am 60
17344,My current shingles experience: Last evening my wife applied a lidocaine patch and it brought some nice relief. Lasted about 3 hours before the now normal pain resumed. Going to another doctor Thursday and Ill update after that.
17345,Update: I'm the woman who fell and broke my arm last month.: I'm so sorry. I think Covid reduced my immune system and allowed the cold sore outbreak from hell too. I hope you feel better soon.
17348,Hi everyone so I live with someone who brought the virus in here who also works in healthcare and is a minimizer. Probably no vaccine since 2021. I have only had one JJ when they first came out. Loves to fight with me about this and has told me several times over the years that they do not care if they infect me. Often comes into contact with Covid positive patients while wearing a KN95 but does not mask in every area of that building. This is quickly becoming a debate between her philosophy of minimization and my cautious approach. Constantly encouraging me to drop the precautions refusing to wear a surgical mask when in the unventilated hallway and wanting to or actually closing the windows and doors I have opened telling me it is not necessary and that I am being selfish. This after I have done what I can to take care of things for her. Other people I know can be downright hostile about my masking. It feels like if I fail here and become infected that it will make my approach look less legit. I treat everyone like they are infected. Never unmask around anyone unless I am outdoors. Have multiple Winix C545s in the house and try to get away with ventilating as much as I can. When I unmask in here I always do it inside whatever air pocket is generated by the HEPA I have nearbymeaning I am within a couple feet of the purifieropen window or closer. Just got a Winix 480 for my 10x10 room. My C5454s and Bionaires have replacement filters in them that I installed maybe a year ago or less. Some have been on a lot more than others but none of these filters should be outdated. Not sure on the status of my Smarthepa's filter. Had it about a year. Run it here and there not 247 or even for hours a day. I just set my fan to blow toward my room door so any viral particles in the hallway will hopefully not get in. I am not sure how many could get in within .52 seconds whenever I open the door. The other person walks the hallway a few times a day so it is not like someone is breathing in it constantly. She is also a very slow and shallow breather these days. I am also not sure how many viral particles can accumulate in the main areas of the house when there are multiple windows and sometimes the backdoor open. I have always tried to wait until I was by myself for at least ten minutes while windows were open before unmasking. There is no way to ventilate the hallway where the bedrooms and bathrooms are because somehow all the windows refuse to open and the one that does in the bathroom has no screen anymorebut I open it some here and there just have to be careful because wasps inhabit the shingles on the house outside of it. I have stuck a C545 in the front of the bathroom along with a Bionaire minitower. CADR rates are about 230 and 75. Also a fan that comes on to blow air out upon entering. And again not sure how many viral particles can get in within the .5 to 1 second needed to open the door and hit the lights so everything turns on. This is a pretty small bathroom with barely enough room for the tub and vanity. I am wearing an Aura or P100 3M elasomeric unless I am sleeping or doing something that requires me to unmask. As far as I can tell I do not notice any air leaking when I breathe in these. It feels completely sealed on my face. Started wearing regular safety goggles on top of my usual glasses. Normally I just wore a mask and had a C545 behind my computer desk a smart HEPA portable next to my desk facing the kitchen along with a cardboard box and other things in a shelf next to me to block possible viral particles and the Bionaires in my room and the bathroom respectively. Plus a C545 next to her couch. When I talk to her now I am standing next to the C545 and the usually open backdoor while masked. Her symptoms went from not much to major diarrhea. I had thought she had a major neurological health event because it was so sudden. One minute she is on the couch sleeping having been up the whole previous night I go to my car to head to Six Flags. Check their app for a couple minutes to see the lines. Ah well the one ride that does not use flash pass is 50 minutes. Decide it is not worth the long drive considering three other things I wanted to ride are all closed too. Come back in after two minutes and she is standing in the kitchen not able to move very well excrement all over her and the couch. Somewhat confused in a way you would expect from someone who had just been jarred out of sleep as she was. Tells me not to call anyone and everyone I do call tells me to observe. After sleeping a ton she ends up being about 95 back to normal today. Got Paxlovid and took the vitamin cocktail I used the one time I got infected. Quercetin NAC 600 Zinc Vitamin D Omega 3 and Vitamin C. I started taking the cocktail last night as a precaution. Shoot Xlear every day and shot it a few more times than usual. She was probably infected a couple days ago when I was holding my breath and not masking in the 12 seconds it would take me to enter my room or the bathroom. The idea being I could hold my breath until I got next to a purifier's air pocket. Not sure how much of a vulnerability that created. I am trying to give as many details as possible because every so often I read accounts by people on Twitter who say they got infected despite them being very cautious. But they never give significant details. So the person I am with did a rapid test in the house today that came back positive. When I asked people at Walgreens about testing there they told me you have to come inside. Their staff are all unmasked and do not seem worried at all about exposure. Yesterday I kept observing more and more Covid symptoms pop up. When the respiratory stuff started then we both suspected Covid. Another minimizer we know thought it may have been alcohol and fatigue and mocked me for thinking it may be Covid. A lot of people are so triggered by mentioning it. The one time I did have Covid I was around an infected person in close quarters with no HEPA did not ventilate the apartment wore a surgical covered by a cloth mask and then was unmasked in a bathroom with an exhaust fan running when they came in there unmasked and were almost exactly six feet away from me for about a minute. Then I probably inhaled more particles when brushing teeth. I had asked them not to come near me unmasked that day and they did not listen. Until I found this place I assumed I would not have gotten infected had I kept my mask on when they were in close proximity. Chalk that up to the poor government messaging. My symptoms were almost nothing for a week. Felt pretty good. Some slight lightheadedness that dulled my reaction times for a couple days. Then on day 7 or 8 it was like norovirus. I had been blasting Xlear dozens of times a day once I knew I had an unmasked exposure. Ended up swallowing a lot of it. Got better each day after the first couple and then took weeks to really resolve. But I could not leave the apartment for days because I would run to the bathroom at random sometimes every half hour. I am trying not to make the same mistakes as last time. We have no AC in the back rooms so it can get pretty humid but it is been cooler lately at night. Can be hard to sleep some times when the sun is out. Humidity supposedly makes the airborne transmission tougher. When I lay in the tub to treat injuries it gets very humid in there. Lots of sweating. Cats are another factor. I have read stuff by people like Laura Miers about them being possibly infected. I have to move some of mine out of my room into big wooden cat houses because they do not let me sleep. And I am trying to minimize their risk too. Get them out quickly stand in front of a C545 then up to the ventilated upstairs. I may just have to leave them with me when I sleep. These minimizers love to provoke and start things. My hope is that I have done an adequate job protecting myself by ensuring that I am only unmasked inside air pockets. And that if I inhale any viral particles that it ends up being such a small viral load that it is closer to getting a vaccine than an infection assuming viral load matters. So far I feel really good. Better than a lot of days. But I know symptoms can lag. The worst thing I am feeling is from the elasomeric and safety goggles squeezing my skull. The goggles put pressure on my nose and also ended up getting the Aura strap digging into the area by my ears. Thanks for reading and if anyone has any other advice it would be greatly appreciated
17352,Got vaccine today: I do not think you have to wait anywhere near that long although I am sure there certain situations that it might be necessary. I got shingles the second week of June and I have been working with a combination of my primary care gastro and an infectious disease specialist since I am immuno compromised by my crohns's meds. They had me get my first shingrix vaccine three weeks ago so that was just about 10 weeks out from having shingles.
17355,I got shingles in m3: Med school gave me a heart murmur
17356,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: You would not get shingles because of a party you went to as a kid. Had shingles unbelievable painful and really hard to sleep
17361,Shingles vaccine: Best friend had is so bad she lost a month of work. She was so afraid the rest of us would get it we literally were dropping her groceries on her doorstep. It was in her face and up to her hairline all along the nerves. She said it was awful.
17363,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I absolutely got my kids the chicken pox vaccine as soon as it came out. I had the smallpox vaccine as a 16 month old because we were travelling. That actually covered me for when all my mates got chicken pox at 8 or 9 years old. It did not cover me for when I was exposed to a baby with it at a daycare I was only there for 2 days too when I was 22. It was horrific I was sick for a couple of weeks and I had to move back in with my mum. The locum came out every night to give me an antihistamine injection just so I could sleep. My digestion was messed up for months after as well. Apparently the were all inside as well as outside. Do not recommend. I will be getting the free shingles vaccine as soon as I hit 65. I am considering it now to be honest but my gp does not think it is necessary at 52.
17365,Very old alt account due to possibly identifying information on my main. I 44F have a birthday on Friday. My favorite meal is hot pot where you have all the delicious meats veggies and sauces all boiled little by little in a communal pot of salty spicy flavorful broth. It is a great group activity and my husband Pete and I eat it often with friends or by ourselves. I wanted to share my favorite bonding experience with my immediate family of my mother 74 stepfather 75 sister Deb 58 and BIL Jon 64ish. My sister and I both have different autoimmune diseases and are both on immunosuppressant medications. Hers is more severe and common than mine and she has a fragile constitution. My family minimizes COVID my mother refuses to get vaccines at all anymore my sister and stepfather only got the very first shot and I have no clue about my BIL whom I am not close with. In contrast Pete and I still mask indoors with N95s or KN94s I get every vaccine my rheumatologist recommends and we buy hand sanitizer by the gallon. If we go out to eat we dine al fresco. We have not had a dinner not outdoors with my family since 2019. Neither of us have had so much as a cold since 2019 let alone COVID. My rheumatologist is very pleased with me and my health right now and all symptoms are tightly controlled. I had asked Deb about a month ago if I could make the family a hot pot meal on her covered patio for my birthday this Saturday and she agreed although she and my mother both kind of turned up their noses at the ingredients and they were each to chip in 25 towards the fixings as my birthday present. I was fine with this as I wanted to have a leisurely intimate family dinner and share my favorite thing with them. I have been planning an epic menu and would be setting up doing the majority of the prep and cooking with the help of my husband supplying all the cooking supplies and even cleaning up. I have spent over 100 so far and expect to spend another 150 for the rest. I have been SO EXCITED for this weekend.. Deb and Jon had gone on vacation to a neighboring state recently and she had been feeling very badly since coming back as recently as this past Sunday according to my mother. Both Pete and I expressed concern within my mother's hearing and were wondering if she had covid because we would postpone the dinner. My mother said it was a bug and gave some of the symptoms which are some of the most recent covid symptoms that are going around. My mother also stated Deb had not taken a covid test. I called Deb about an hour ago to ask how she was feeling and confirm the time of arrival. She was initially very short with me then started yelling at me that people expect her to give and give but that no one has any consideration for her and no one wants her around and that my mother texted her that my husband and I no longer want to have the dinner because she is sick and we could get sick. She then continued that she fell getting out of the shower on vacation hurt her back badly and that it caused a flareup of her autoimmune disease so we could not get sick from her. She then burst into tears continued yelling and would not let me get a word in edgewise. It took a while before I could tell her our mother never told me or Pete that Deb had fallen and all the issues were from her autoimmune disease. Deb read the text that my mother had sent her probably as soon as we left my mother's house and the way my mother had worded it sounded awful. Essentially the text said that we were scared of catching covid from Deb and did not want to be near her if she was sick. It then mentioned some of the rather expensive meat we had bought for the dinner which I had shown my mother. If I had gotten that text I would have been hurt too however Deb lost it so completely on me and called me condescending and hurtful. Thing is our mother has a tendency to gossip and put things in the worst possible way. My mother can be a pretty terrible person especially when we were kids. We talk about it on occasion and those shared experiences are some of our closest times sonce no one else knows what we have been through. We were both abused but Deb always says I had it easy since Mom got saved when I was a kid and I was spared the extremes she had to go through. I consciously debate going low contact with my mother at least once a year. At the same time we are both very competitive for our mother's attention and try to outdo ourselves with getting her holiday and birthday gifts getting time with her and generally we help subsidize her standard of living Deb more than me. Yes it is very unhealthy and I definitely need to go get therapy for this someday. Deb is very likely nondiagnosed neurodivergent has extreme rejection aversion and is possibly slightly autistic. She has one nonfamily friend that I know of and her marriage is not good to put it mildly. A similar meltdown happened once before when I did not hug her a few years ago when she had active shingles. She drove away sobbing when we were gathering for a fun activity the three of us were going to do together. This has taken all of the joy out of my birthday and I do not even know if I want to do it anymore. But when I told Deb we could call it off because I do not want her to feel like I am using her for her patio and Jon set up something else somewhat intrusive to go on at the same time she said she had rearranged her schedule for this so I could come over. She then said the ball is in my court. When I was finally able to talk I apologized for her being hurt and told her Mom had texted something I never said or intended. I also reminded her how Mom could be and she said she was not blaming anyone but she would have called if she had covid and what I said was hurtful. If she had covid I just would have rescheduled so she could be there too. I feel like an asshole because I am concerned for both my health and hers. Nobody in my family really takes precautions and they believe in the faith not fear thing. I believe in science and using your common sense. I feel like Deb is going to resent me being there and resent me if I cancel. She already told me if it is awkward during the dinner it is my fault. And Deb can really drag a mood down she ruined Disney World when she was unhappy. I have been crying this afternoon because I was concerned she would been sick for over 2 weeks and that was why I would called. If I call my mother and get upset with her for misrepresenting what I said then she will get all upset call Deb cry and make things even worse. Thinking about it my biggest mistake was not calling Deb immediately after I heard she was sick but we do not talk that often...maybe once or twice a month for an hour at a time. I feel like I am fucked no matter what I do and I do not even feel like celebrating my birthday. Am I the asshole in this situation?
17367,MILs work has a RSV outbreak do we still go for Christmas ?: RSV was awful for our family. My 2.5yo ended up in the hospital overnight because his oxygen was so low. The hospital staff was all maskedgownedgloved up like it was some crazy infectious disease that is how contagious it is. They told me that because covid testing swabs did RSV at the same time they were seeing that RSV was much more common and dangerous in adults than previously known. Also new tracking was showing it was deadly for old people causing the pneumonia or bronchitis their deaths were originally blamed on. There is a reason there is a vaccine for it now for seniors and young babies. It is been two years and my son now has a respiratory airway diagnosis and needs breathing treatments for every respiratory illness because of the damage RSV did. My husband and I both had it at the time as well and it is the worst sickness we ever remember having including covid. It took us weeks to get over and mine caused a sinus infection and double ear infections only cleared with two antibiotics. My baby is 10m and was vaccinated at 7m as well as I got the vaccine during pregnancy. Even with that I still would not go knowing there is a high chance your family would be in contact with it during the visit.
17371,Hello All I d just like to give my two cents on this because I am knee deep in a shingles outbreak and had no idea. What I thought to be allergic reaction from the garden fire ants grass etc and was scratching like crazy. Be nedry l. Still there. Days go by low grade fever flu like symptoms and the burn from hell on back and left side. Thought for sure cellulitis. Hit the VA and Shingles it is. The meds burn on the way out because it screws up the gut flour a. Now I need an ice back for the back end I was exposed sometime end of June going into July and there s no telling where I bumped into someone with an OPEN rash or shedding. I am saying all this to either get your vaccine or get ready for hell. I don t need a vaccine now and was never promoted to get it. I am 48 Vitamin Bs to boost immune system and diabetics are more susceptible. This stuff is contagious and will spread quickly. Hoped this helped at least one person.
17375,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 29 weeker got his He did great with it and I Am not as terrified to leave my house lol
17378,Put me out of my misery.: GTFO Wondering if that is what is going on with me I wear contacts and thought I scratched my cornea. Feels like eyelids are made out of 80 grit sandpaper. Extreme sensitivity to light and cloudy vision which is basically useless. Usually this goes away within 48 to 72 hours. But mine has not It is been about a week and a half. I keep telling myself it is just a bad corneal scratch. But at the same time now that you mention it I also felt like my immune system was really down. I had a painful sore under my tongue which I have never had before. I am really run down. Fuck me running I have been meaning to get my shingles vaccine because I had chicken pox really bad as a child. Do not remember what age I had chicken pox but I am 51 now. Still have pictures that my parents took showing hundreds if not thousands of pox covering my body. Nothing would surprise me to tell you the truth.
17379,Shingles vaccine: I got the vaccine recently. Nothing but a sore arm. Medicare paid for it. I Am 66. My brother and I both had chicken pox. He got shingles in his 50s and suffered terribly
17384,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: When did the vaccine come out? Because my brother got the vaccine in the late 90s and ended up with a really mild case. I caught it from a kid at daycare before I got vaccinated at 4 in 1994 and I got it bad. Covered head to toe. When I got my immunity checked before starting grad school 23 years later my antibodies were through the roof
17386,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I wish I could get the vaccine. My mom got shingles 6 years ago and is still dealing with the repercussions and pain from it
17387,Got our flu and Covid upcoming 930 Already did shingles RSV vaccine knocked me last year
17389,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I got the vaccine at 26. I was 25 when I had shingles had it kept reoccurring that year. After I was a few months of no new issues I got the vaccine. I was good the last 10 years until the other week and a new spot showed up. But it was very minor compared to the previous time I had it years ago. I will be getting an updated vaccine in a few months.
17391,Recurring Warts. Need advice.: I hope the viral load is indeed decreasing. I Have been abstaining from sex also ever since I found out just so I do not get any more viral load and I do not pass it on either. Hoping the vaccine also does something to help also esp since I Have gotten my 2nd dose. Been trying not to think so much about it and go on as normal but sometimes it just makes me overthink about this and wonder if it will ever get better.
17392,About to admitted to hospital for the third time since bringing home our triplets: The were vaccinated the day after they came home from their last admission which would have been 3 weeks ago and I just found out that their swab came back positive for RSV. It feels like a cosmic joke. My 2 year old is not eligible for the RSV vaccine where I live. Its only available to under 2 right now in Canada.
17394,PHN or MS?: Before I got my shingles diagnosis the doctor thought I had MS and I did the MRI got set up with a doctor at Vanderbilts MS Clinic and everything before they ruled it out. I was having tremors widespread nerve pain on both sides leg weakness headaches balance issues nerve pain paresthesia. Turns out I do believe most of my issues were undiagnosed shingles that were internal at the time and have since come to the surface and begun to hop around all over my body. Everyone talks about oh my rash is not that bad. Yeah but its what its doing inside you that should worry you. The nerve damage is catastrophic sometimes. The thing about MS is that you need to get ahead of it You can stop its progression but once it progresses you cannot get back what it takes from you. I would err on the side of caution and talk to your GP about the nerve pain. A brain MRI takes about 15 minutes to see if they see any concerning lesions. And if nothing else you will get some peace. If there is something to worry about you will get on a good med up front and slow or even stop the progression of the disease and keep it from taking anything else from your life. There Is an MS Reddit thread when I was getting undiagnosed. And they are kind people who will offer you a lot of guidance and kindness on Reddit. They were a strong area of support for me when I was struggling.
17398,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Besides the sore arm I had no adverse reactions. Did you get Shingrex? I guess I am just an outlier because I also had no adverse affects from flu or all the Covid shots 4
17399,RSV Vaccine in Canada ca: I got my vaccine at 344 weeks. No reaction whatsoever. I did not even get a sore arm from it. No regrets whatsoever and would do it again in a heartbeat My insurance covered most of it 90. I did have to push for my doctor to prescribe it since she was hesitant that it would not be covered and Id have to fully pay out of pocket
17400,Shingles vaccine: I surprisingly had no problems other than a sore arm.
17402,Shingles vaccine question: I went out drinking the evening after getting both my shots not a single reaction  not even a sore arm. Your mileage may vary.
17406,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I had a mild case of shingles and it SUCKED. Not 50 yet but will get the vaccine as soon as i can.
17409,I almost lost 2 teeth to shingles.: I had shingles in March. Tooth pain due to abscess May. Tooth extraction July 3.ugh
17411,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: I had mine at cvs. They said I had to get two injections about three months apart. I will double check to see if I got that wrong. I would be thrilled to be wrong about a second dose
17415,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Same for me too with 2nd shot but it was over within 24 hrs. Hang in there. I am sure it is better than the alternative.
17418,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Had it in my early 40 s right on my right hip belt line. Felt like I would rolled around in fiberglass IY KY K. It started when I was squatting and my right leg would not fire at all. I would thought I would really f d something up. My doc just looked at it for a second and then started chuckling and started writing a prescription. He said go to the pharmacy and take this as soon as they hand it to you. you are going to need it. He was not kidding. I stayed high as a kite for a week and did not move unless absolutely necessary.
17424,Shingles vaccine experience: Got my second shot about two months ago. It was about the same. Sore arm. I actually Know two people with eye issues due to shingles. That was the kicker for me like the lingering shingles rash and pain was not bad enough What Was I Waiting For?
17425,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: That Is what my doctor said. She was shocked when I took off my shirt and said it is the worst she has ever seen. I have nothing to compare it too except others photos. I will say that the sharp pains in the jaw and arm are actually worse than the rash itself. Thank you for the food and supplements advice I will take it.
17429,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yeah caught me off guard too. It was a couple years back when so many people wanted vaccines there were no appointments in my town. Smugly during vacation I found a pharmacy that had appointments and set myself up with a shingles shot. The next day we had to drive 5 hours. I sat in the passenger seat whimpering with the seat heater on and my husband at the wheel. I felt so bad I could not help him drive. I scheduled my second shot very differently. It is a doozy
17430,Shingles and other Vaccines: I know having a reaction to the shingles vaccine is rough but trust me you do not want to get shingles. My mom had a normal case but it never went away. She had blisters and painful neuropathy for the rest of her life. Even morphine did not fully take away the pain.
17431,Shingles shot: Ok. I thought I read there are two shots. I thought I read a couple of comments from people stating they felt sick after receiving one or both shots. I guess I Am mistaken? As for my body being thrown out of homeostasis that has happened to me too many times. A hidden ingredient in Schmidts deodorant fucked me up for a year. The ingredient is thimerosal a preservative used in cosmetics and some vaccines.
17436,When you are pregnant and you read What To Expect or similar books or online resources you will find lists of pregnancy symptoms. Things like nausea vomiting food aversions fatigue headaches dizziness mood swings swelling back pain stretch marks varicose veins etc. These lists are already loooooong and no joke and I think a lot of us are experiencing or have experienced most of the symptoms on any given list. But THEN other things happen to your body that are not on the lists and 1010 times your medical professional andor Google will tell you oh yes that can happen due to pregnancy. Its like a whole secret menu of pregnancy symptoms. It makes me wonder how long is the real menu??? I Am curious what you have discovered on the secret menu and when it came up for you. Here Is mine 1st trimester Shingles. Apparently not uncommon for this to flare because your immune system is worn down. 1st 2nd trimester Globus sensation. This weird persistent feeling that something is stuck in your throat. 3rd trimester Pyogenic granuloma. A bloody little noncancerous tumor that my dentist burned out of my mouth this week. Pregnancy is TOUGH you all What have you found on the menu?
17438,First time shingles and scared: Unfortunate circumstances. I had antivirals within a few hours of the rash appearing and it still took a few days for everything to stop progressing. Best of luck and take care
17441,Shingles shot Ack: Yep. I had that too. Chills. Crawled into bed for like 10 hours. Only lasted one day. So glad I got it the shot. My sis got the shingles. She was putting off the shot just kept procrastinating. For age reference. She Is boomer generation. She was out for like weeks
17443,RSV vaccine preterm labor risk?: I got the RSV vaccine 35w pregnant. Had to be induced at 406 and so far a 6 week thriving and healthy LO
17444,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I would not get it if I were you. I am in the hyper reaction boat. I had shingles 10 times before breaking down and getting the vaccine 3 years ago and have had it 7 times since then and they have been my most painful cases. Definitely DO NOT recommend getting the vaccine if you have had shingles before but ymmv.
17448,After my first shingles shot I went to workout. My second shingles shot I went out to dinner that night. Guess I was one of the lucky ones
17449,Shingles and other Vaccines: I was 40 overweight not in any good shape and a quarantine alcoholic with several diagnosed immunity issues. I had no problem with either dose. My roommate who was in peak physical health amazing stamina low bmi good immune system great diet got so fucking sick both times he wanted to die. So who knows. I think it was worth it regardless he does too.
17450,My vaccine kids did likejust over a year ago All 6 at the time of them I was so excited I actually had a couple of pox myself and a fever a good immunity booster to protect me from shingles
17452,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My friends and I were about 8 for the vaccine. I never got it somehow and neither did our best friend. Id been vaccinated though. She got it at 18 and was out of school for a fucking month. She said it was MISERABLE.
17454,Shingles Vaccine worsened symptoms: Every vaccine does this to me. It gets your immune system work and ours is dod gy. Get loads of rest and try to eat bland for a few days. Hopefully the next medication will clear it up feel better
17456,BELLE PLAINE She doesn t know how long she stared out her kitchen window one evening in late January. But when she looked down Lani Mum by saw blood blooming in the sink s soapy water. Oh she thought remembering that she had been washing a knife. I cut my finger. How did I do that? Oh expletive. I m really starting to have blackout moments Mum by 28 had felt weak for about a month one of several mysterious medical symptoms she and her former coworkers at C 6 Zero had been experiencing since the december 8 explosion that filled the company s shingle recycling factory in Marengo with fire and black smoke. In the four months since the blast which ignited a blaze that firefighters battled for 20 hours former employees said they have become frustrated and scared as they wonder what chemicals they inhaled. Mum by whose panicked voice is heard on a call to 911 operators after the explosion said her problems began the week of Christmas when she felt too tired to get out of bed. She was cold wrapping herself in blankets throughout the day. Her bones ached. She didn t have an appetite. She couldn t keep down liquids. She couldn t hold her 1 year old son. By January she started to black out. Friends snapped fingers in her face telling Mum by she was staring dead eyed through conversations. The lights were on Mum by said but no one was home Company says one of its chemical mixes is flammable toxic possibly carcinogenic Mum by and seven other former C 6 Zero employees told the Des Moines Register that the company s found Howard Cornelius Brand III failed to follow Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards for hazard communication in the months leading to the explosion. Among other violations they say Brand didn t give them government mandated safety data sheets listing what chemicals the company was using to dissolve shingles into oil leaving them unsure what substances they breathed in plunged their hands into and even swallowed. Workers also accused the renewable energy company s leader of neglecting to train them on how to handle the substances. In an email to the Des Moines Register on Tuesday C 6 Zero spokesperson Mark Coral lo denied the employees statements. He said the company did not violate OSHA standards that the work received training and that employees could see information about C 6 Zero s chemicals if they wanted. No employees asked to review the Safety Data Sheet forms Coral lo said. Three employees disputed that statement to the Register and the you. S. Environmental Protection Agency recently cited C 6 Zero on similar grounds. It issued a notice of violation to the company April 10 for allegedly failing to disclose chemicals to local emergency responder s before the explosion. An EPA investigation into the company and an Iowa OSHA inquiry are still pending. C 6 Zero maintained for months that the EPA and Iowa state officials couldn t disclose the company s chemical mixes to employees or the public due to trade secret laws. It has now backed off that assertion Coral lo said Tuesday. In his email to the Register he provided safety data sheets for two mixes a solvent that dissolves shingles into oil and a diesel based stock that employees were supposed to blend with the oil at the end of the process. Required by OSHA standards a safety data sheet spells out what chemicals a company uses in a mixture what health hazards those chemicals pose how first responder s should react to an accident and what environmental damage the chemicals can because. But the company s safety data sheet for its shingle dissolving solvent provides little information about what chemicals C 6 Zero used. The document states that 60 of the mix is a proprietary blend and the rest is Aromatic 200 a term that covers several potential compounds that refineries capture while turning crude oil into gasoline experts say. Among other health risks according to the safety data sheet the solvent can burn eyelids and because blindness. Prolonged repeated exposure can damage the blood spleen and stomach. The safety data sheet for the company s diesel stock blend the final oil product from the solvent and dissolved shingles shows that overexposure can damage the brain and nervous systems. Symptoms include loss of memory coordination and intellectual capacity. Two of the chemicals used in the blend naphthalene and cum ene are reasonably anticipated to because cancer it says. Risk of cancer depends on duration and level of exposure the author of the safety data sheet wrote. According to written responses the company gave the EPA after the blast about 60000 gallons of the blend s at in a rotating t rommel at the time of the explosion. The EPA estimates that about 31500 pounds of extremely hazardous substances were emitted into the air from the diesel stock blend after the explosion. Before the company s disclosures Tuesday several employees told the Register that they had been in the dark about what health risks they faced in the months leading up to the explosion. They still don t know several important facts including what concentration of chemicals were emitted into the air during the explosion or in the months before. On the day of the blast the EPA and Iowa Department of Natural Resources did not conduct air monitoring in or around Marengo spokespeople for the agencies said. EPA officials estimated the amount of substances in the air based on the chemicals C 6 Zero said after the explosion that it had been using EPA spokesperson S hanna Be is ser told the Register. Multiple health experts who spoke to the Register criticized C 6 Zero for failing to educate work about what chemicals they used in the factory. The experts also criticized state officials for failing to fight for public disclosure of the documents in the months after the explosion. This is 21 st century America and we re treating people like they re in the 19 th century when people didn t know what they were work with said Dev ra Lee Davis an epi de mio logi st and found of the Environmental Health Trust. Frankly I don t understand how they can get away with it Ill former C 6 Zero work We don t know what the future holds Mum by and other former employees said their doctors have been frustrated in recent months unsure what treatment to provide them. Diagnosed with thyroid disease when she was 12 Mum by has used the same medication since then. She conceded that her recent problems may have occurred because she stopped taking her thyroid hormone pills for two weeks after the explosion failing to refill her prescription on time. But she said she had paused medication for periods in the past and never experienced such intense symptoms. Health experts recommend that patients maintain thyroid stimulating hormone levels between 0 5 and 5 milli international units per liter. In June before she started work at C 6 Zero Mum by s T SH level was low about 0 2. But when she visited the hospital on january 10 a month after the explosion a blood test showed a T SH level well above a safe range 356. High T SH levels mean patients bodies aren t producing enough thyroid hormones to meet their needs. Researchers have concluded that the condition hypo thyroid is m can lead to anemia cancers autoimmune diseases and kidney diseases. When Mum by resumed taking her medication she said her condition worsened. On january 23 after she blacked out and cut her finger she visited the emergency room at St. Luke s Hospital in Cedar Rapids. Doctors intravenously pumped thyroid hormones into her bloodstream. A lab test showed her T SH level had increased to 493. Mum by who shared a copy of her lab results with the Register said her doctor has changed her medication and increased her dose three times. Still her T SH levels have bounced up and down staying in a dangerous range. On january 31 her level was 175. On february 20 it was 183. On March 24 it was 318. Mum by said recent lab tests also found that her kidneys are no longer functioning properly leading to a diagnosis of stage 3 kidney disease. A Unity Point Health spokesperson declined the Register s request for an interview with Mum by s physician s assistant. Mum by said she has felt weak throughout the year continuing to struggle to get out of bed many days. Too sick to work she put her home up for sale to pay medical bills. I don t function I guess like a normal healthy person she said. The company s new disclosures have made Mum by worry more about what risks she exposed herself to when she joined C 6 Zero last August. Though she said she can t know for sure what caused her current problems the company s safety data sheet shows the shingle dissolving solvent is a potential endocrine disruptor meaning the chemicals can mimic or interfere with hormones. Ingestion of the solvent can also lead to renal failure according to the document. She said her doctors are frustrated that they don t know what substances may have caused her problems. No one knows what we put our lives on the line for Mum by said. And we don t know what the future holds Other former C 6 Zero employees say they re also concerned about the illnesses Joni Pariz ek who joined the company the week of Thanksgiving work along C 6 Zero s conveyor belt the morning of the explosion. She was supposed to sort through the sludge like dissolved asphalt shingles and remove rocks and nails. Around 1115 a m. she bent over to pull up her sock. Ten feet away she said the sludge stopped moving on the conveyor piling up. Two coworkers shoved metal rods against the belt trying to push the sludge forward. The machine sparked. Vapors from the nearby chemical mix exploded. Pariz ek said the impact s force threw her about 10 feet. It sucked everything out of us she said. Like a tsunami sucks water out comes back in at full force. That s what it did to our insides The ceiling and walls collapsed. One visitor inside the factory later told a 911 dispatcher that concrete blocks fell on him. Two employees caught fire. After Pariz ek scrambled free past flames and smoke she said she struggled to breathe. She felt sick that afternoon. She felt heartburn. Over the last four months her symptoms have changed. Some days she said her body becomes stiff. Her muscles feet and arms ache. About once a day she added a headache starts in the back of her neck. The pain creeps to her right eye. She has to lie down. Everything starts to move she said. I ll just get real dizzy Her nose bleeds about once a week. I could fill up a big bath towel actually I have she said. We re talking hours. It just bleeds. It s not just a little drip. It s gushing Amanda Dawson who joined the company in February 2022 said she deals with daily headaches and heartburn. Day na Struve who started four days before the explosion said she still has a cough a runny nose headaches and a hoarse voice that makes her sound like an old lady that smoked a carton a day It s just constant she said. Just constant sickness Struve counted herself lucky compared to other employees and she didn t visit the emergency room until the day after the blast. But when she did go she couldn t answer a doctor s questions about what she inhaled. More recently she said she began to wonder what future health risks she faces. Pariz ek said her work compensation doctor is frustrated as well unsure of what problems to check for. Am I going to drop dead in a year she said. Am I going to get sick? It s something that we ve got to think about Keeping chemicals secret an absolute scandal environmental science professor says Weeks before the explosion local officials said they tried to find out what chemicals C 6 Zero used. Iowa County Emergency Management Coordinator Josh Humphrey said he asked the D NR for a list of the company s chemicals after firefighters extinguished a small blaze inside the plant october 25. His agency maintains records of exposures in case firefighters develop illnesses. But at that point he said the D NR had not received the list. In an April 4 statement C 6 Zero s Coral lo disputed this version of events saying the company s safety data sheets were made available for review to state and local officials at the C 6 Zero facility throughout its operations As with his statement that none of the employees had asked for safety data sheets several ex workers dispute this assertion. After the explosion the company gave the EPA safety data sheets for its diesel blending stock and Kani k su the shingle dissolving solvent that C 6 Zero maintained was proprietary. But Humphrey said the EPA previously had denied his request for the documents citing the company s claims that it was exempt from public records laws because the chemicals involved were trade secrets. EPA attorney Angela Still wagon told the Register on April 7 that the agency was still evaluating C 6 Zero s claim an issue that Coral lo on Tuesday said the company had stopped disputing. State officials also have not disclosed the documents. C 6 Zero gave the Iowa Attorney General s Office records of its chemicals in mid February after Iowa District Judge Lars Anderson issued a temporary restraining order requiring the disclosure. But C 6 Zero turned over the documents only after Anderson also issued an order allowing the company to declare the documents confidential. The Iowa Attorney General s Office did not oppose the company s motion. Humphrey said even some Iowa D NR officials had not been allowed to see the documents. Asked to verify this D NR spokesperson Tammi e Kraus man said The Attorney General s Office is best to answer this question An Attorney General s Office spokesperson did not respond to a list of questions. Before C 6 Zero s disclosure Tuesday Humphrey said he did not know how to identify what health risks that local emergency responder s faced. Something may have happened to them because of the fire Humphrey told the Register earlier this month. That could happen in any fire. This one is just kind of an outlier because we don t know what chemicals are involved Dr. Danny Teitelbaum an environmental science professor at the Colorado School of Mines who has studied occupational exposure said government officials should not have allowed the company to conceal the safety data sheets after the explosion. While a company can argue the percentage of chemicals that make up a mix is proprietary he said the parts of the document that spell out health risks should be public. I don t know how anyone and I mean anyone the attorney general God himself could make a material safety data sheet proprietary Teitelbaum said. This is an absolute scandal Ex employees at C 6 Zero describe a work they say was full of hazards. Tyler Jett is an investigative reporter for the Des Moines Register.

17458,So I got shingles a matter of days after my 1st infusion Docetaxol PHESGO as my GP. Practice would not bend over to accommodate vaccination in a timely manner before chemo started. Given I have got months of treatment ahead of me wellyears really as I am metastatic HER2 positive so will be on some form of herceptin LONGER term DO I REQUEST THE VACCINE AGAIN IN ANOTHER 6 MONTHS? I understand that Shingrix is not a live vaccine so I can take it safely during treatment.but just wondering how often everyone was offered given it during active treatment? Was it is it twice a year? Or just annually? Or just a one off? And now that I have had shingles so soon would I have immunity for the next 6 months or longer? I know its a Q I should ask my GP but honestly getting past the Receptionists is an ordeal I am in the UK so NHS patient.
17460,I am on day 7 of my first ever shingles outbreak. I Am 29 years old healthy and have not had any recent illnesses or stressors so I Am super shocked to have shingles. I had a baby about a year and a half ago and have had about a million colds and hand foot mouth since my kid has been in daycare. So my immune system could be worn down. But I was just celebrating the fact that I had not been sick in a couple monthsand then this happened. Anyway it started as what I thought was a clump of spider bites below my left armpit. I thought maybe I was just having a reaction to the bites but then the most intense make you want to crawl out of your skin itch kept spreading across my left shoulder blade. Finally went in and got diagnosed and started antivirals around day 4. The itch has remained intense and today my left upper shoulder is really sore like I slept wrong and I Am overall fatigued. The only thing that has been temporarily helping the itch is ice packs.
17463,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Got the 2 shots right after I turned 50 no big deal for me. Had shingles twice before pretty painful each time so get that vaccine
17464,Shingles vaccine: Get the vaccine I am 64f. I got Shingles for my 39th birthday and put off getting the vaccine because I mistakenly believed that if you had it once you would not get it again. I was painfully proven wrong a couple months ago when I did indeed get it again. HELL ON EARTH. I got it up and down the back of my left thigh all the way up to my waist. I could not sit and the pain and itch were so bad I did not sleep for 4 nights. I was advised by the doctor that I could wait to get the vaccine for a bit since I am just getting over it so should be protected for a little while but I plan to get it the first one within the month. I never want to go through it again. I can still feel the nerve pain in my leg.
17465,41 and got Shingles: A lot of people with auto immune issues ended up getting shingles after getting their Covid shot. Usually super up mild about 47 days after the shot and also in the opposite side of which the shot was given. It is not that the Covid shot gave people shingles but when it definitely caused a response with some people autoimmune issues.
17470,This looks like shingles to me. I know because my friend got it right after being vaccinated with the Covid 19 shot. Unless of course you went and got a shingles vaccine. Look up the ingredients.....shocking.
17475,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Makes sense how the only funny thing she did was shutting up
17476,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus loves me the most Jesus Bitch what?
17478,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same. I remember having chickenpox when I was five at Christmas I had to wear mitts and they were all over my scalp. When I was 24 I started feeling absolutely awful and found a large rash spreading across my back. No one believed that I had shingles had to get my roommate to take me to the Medclinic where again I was told it could not be...oh wait it was totally shingles. A severe case in which the medicines I was taking for it would knock me out 18 hours a day and when I was not sleeping I was eating because another medication would make you incredibly hungry. It blew. Then came the side effect of postherpetic neuralgia. To dumb that one down it was basically all the pain of shingles without having shingles and it could stay with you for days or years as i was told at the time. I had it for 7 months and I just wanted to end it all because my back felt like it was both on fire and super tensesore nonstop.
17485,Because of shingles other than stress?: I got it the first time when my second kid was under a year. The pregnancy and his first year of life were pretty stressful. It recurred about once  twice a year until the same kid accidentally kicked me in the face and the instant pain revealed a huge dental abscess. I have no proof the two are related but I have not had shingles since AND a bunch of other anxiety type symptoms have also disappeared. Night sweats panic attacks. I still get the nerve pain though .
17487,Shingles vaccine: You would have gotten the MMR vaccine when you were about 16 months old. I Am older than the MMR vaccine so I never had it. The symptoms of tetanus are a hardening of the muscles. I felt like my legs were made of concrete I could barely bend them. I caught it before it rose to my internal organs. Had I not called the doc my organs would have seized and I would have died. Many people get it starting from the head and it causes lockjaw. That technically is tetanus. And that can be fatal if left untreated. You know if you have tetanus it does not have hidden symptoms.
17490,Shingles and other Vaccines: Get the 2dose vaccination for sure A few days of a sore arm and feeling crappy is a free trip to Disneyland compared to getting shingles. My dad got shingles and he was in PAIN for months plus it came back a few times. Shingles can affect you in a variety of locations. Avoid it. Also make sure to get your pneumonia shot if you are 65 or older.
17499,This will be rambling. Hopefully it is understandable. I am 47f going through a bunch of weird stuff related to menopause ADHD and post bariatric surgery so my dopamine and iron levels are seriously wacky and we have been working on getting it all under control. I take piles of meds and supplements. I am having some weird symptoms with my right ear. It is been off and on for a few years. My hearing is a bit muffled I have the sensation of it being slightly clogged it is been itching and I will occasionally hearfeel what I can only describe as tiny bubbles popping inside my ear. From what I understand mostly based on Google and Reddit  this can be a menopause thing a coming off of gabapentin thing or an ear infection. I have mostly been ignoring it for the past couple of years but the itching got more intense when I was weaning off of gabapentin and I started to have some pain so I saw my PCP's nurse. She said it looked irritated but not infected so she gave me some ear drops combo steroid and antibiotic. The pain has not come back and the itching seems to have decreased but I am still having the muffled hearing and feeling of bubbles. I saw my PCP today and during check in with a different nurse I asked about a shingles vaccine since my husband just got his. While we were chatting I told her about how I had shingles in my right ear maybe 10 years ago. A light bulb went off in her head and she said I should chat with my doc about it. While waiting for the doc to come in I ended up here on Reddit and learned a bit about Ramsay Hunt etc. So I saw my doc and she said she could see some scarring on my eardrum and she wants me to see an ENT and that it could be a shingles thing but it would be a weird shingles thing. In any case it is worth seeing an ENT for. So my question... Has anyone else had hearingear symptoms start up several years after having shingles in the same ear? And if so was it determined to be related to the shingles at all? Thanks
17501,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: I had the vaccine at 25 and then again this year at 37. I did not have any side effects. Arm was a little sore but that was it. Obviously everyone is different. Id chat with the doctor but I think you will be fine with either unless you have had issues with vaccines in the past.
17504,Hello fellow sufferers I am in my 4th week of shingles outbreak on my neck and behind my right ear. I was able to start valtrex at about the 72 hour mark. I also got a short course of Prednisone prescribed as my hearing and balance was effected initially. Thankfully I have not had any more vertigo but still feel pressure in my ear and I can tell I have some mild hearing loss. The first 2 weeks the pain was never that bad. I was moving 900 miles to another state... very stressful but managed with the 2 Rx meds ibuprofen and CBD oil. But the third week I developed itching as my rash healed. That was sooooo uncomfortable and was making me frantic. My telemedicine doctor prescribed gabapentin. I take 300 mg 2 hours before bedtime. It definitely calmed down the itching so I could sleep and I am not increasing my dose for daytime use. My question is ever since starting gabapentin I get a single paroxysm of horrific burning pain in my neck and ear every day. 10 out of 10 pain. Like a firey blowtorch on my skin. It passes after a minute or two. I have got a message into my doctor but after reading on this forum about gabapentin it feels too coincidental about this new symptom and the start of the med. Last 2 nights I have only taken half the powder in a 300 mg capsule and tonight I am not taking any. I am hoping these pain attacks stop soon. They are totally random and fortunately have not happened while driving. I do not need to drive much...but apprehensive if I do need too. Meanwhile I started alpha lipoic acid theanine and B12. Anything to help heal my nerves. Each day my general pain improves. I noticed tonight I worked in the yard and between the exercise and cool air I barely felt any pain. Anyone else get these blowtorch pains that are over quickly? Did they resolve? Is it a phase of healing? I have read some papers on pubmed about neuropathic pain and it sounds like sodium channel issues and maybe skin treatment like capsaicin or lidocaine is the way to go. I just ordered some 4 percent lidocaine patches. Anyway I hope some researchers somewhere are working on better treatments for shingles and PHN.
17507,Shingles vaccine: Get it. I have known several people that had shingles in the face and eye. One cannot see with that eye and the other have bad vision now. It is just a shot. No big deal.
17513,Shingles shot: I never had much of a reaction from the first one just a sore arm. Hopefully the second one will be the same. So I read that these are only good for 710 years but no reimmunization is suggested due to lack of data. So maybe we will need it again...
17514,Shingles vaccine: Just got the first shot a few weeks ago. Injection site just a little sore for a couple of days. No sickness. Getting second shot in January.
17522,Shingles Vaccine Tinnitus HELP?: I have had tinnitus for as long as I can remember all the way back to childhood. And I did not notice any changes in mine after the shingles vaccine. and I was born deaf in one ear and am hardofhearing in the other where the tinnitus lives.
17526,Shingrix for 50yr olds: Yes I walked 2 miles a day. I have not been lately because of the pain in my head.
17527,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Both my Shingrix shots had barely any side effects. CVS quick and easy and covered by my insurance.
17528,Realworld evidence from over one million COVID19 vaccinations is consistent with reactivation of the varicellazoster virus.  The risk of developing shingles was 0.20 for the vaccinated  0.11 for the unvaccinated. The difference was statistically highly significant P  0.0001.: There truly was viral evil on social media including videos by nurses mocking and condescending people who had horrible vaccine reactions
17533,Shingles vaccine first dose side effects report: May I ask which autoimmune condition you have and the symptoms you experienced? I have POTS as well as other autonomic neuropathy that impacts my entire GI system in addition to vestibular migraine.
17535,Shingles shot kicks your butt. So does the booster.
17539,I have had long covid symptoms for almost two years and it was fairly mild compared to what i have seen from many of the posts here but I did frequently have to take days off work for physical fatigue and brain fog. PEM was really bad and any significant physical or mental exertion would leave me bedridden and unable to focus on anything longer than a tweet for two days. I got covid the first time december 2022 and the second time january 2024 and I have to assume being vaccinated kept the long covid from being worse. In september I got shingles despite being under 40 which also seems to be a common long covid thing. I was put on valtrex for shingles and it turns out getting shingles is one of the best things to happen to me. I felt better with shingles than I had in years. After I went off valtrex and the shingles cleared up symptoms came back hard and I talked my doctor into putting my back on valtrex at a maintenance dose plus celecoxib since those two together are being used in a medical trial. This has given me about 80 symptom reduction. I still feel the brain fog but its not nearly as impairing and the physical fatigue is mostly gone and its hard to tell what is long covid and what is two years of not being able to exercise. Now I am trying to talk my doctor into running extra tests to figure out why its helping. I Have seen that this has been helpful for some of you all as well. Seeing that it helped some folks here helped encourage me to push to get back on it after shingles cleared so thank you. I Am pretty sure i have had it for four years but I could not get tested for covid in march 2020 and the long covidpasc symptoms blended in with other things so I cannot say for sure. Either way it got noticeably worse almost two years ago.
17540,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Round two of the shingles vaccine had me in bed for 36 hours.
17541,Night sweats after 3rd shingles shingrix vaccination: I hear you. vaccine has not yet been made valid too many problems. Mine have lasted 5 months
17542,Shingles vaccine: I have had shingles get the shot.
17543,Shingles and other Vaccines: I was very fortunate in that I got a limited case of shingles just an itchy patch on my back. I went right to my PC and got an antiviral. I was wfh at the time so I could dress in a way to avoid irritating that area. It was a sign that I needed to get out of that job. I started planning my exit. About a year to the day after that diagnosis I announced my retirement. I got the vaccine as soon as my PC said I could. All vaccines covid too give me a reaction. Its much easier to deal with any reaction now they I Am retired. Id seen coworkers who were around retirement age who got sick from the stress as I had. Some would keep working ignoring the signs. Those people would get sicker and sicker until they realized it was time to go. I was ready to bolt at the first opportunity. Shingles was plenty of notice for me.
17549,Shingles with PHN after: I was diagnosed with a condition Called Trigeminal neuralgia when I was 21 after my ex pushed me into a brick wall and slammed my head. I had shingles for the first time 9 years later. The TN pain I was used to made the shingles seem like a joke. I do have pain and numbness in the left side of my face. I wonder if the shingles destroyed the nerve to some degree. But I also have a brain mass. So who knows what causes what. I Am so sorry you have this pain too. If you ever need to talk feel free to send me a message
17550,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Op Husband and her Ils are horrific. But I need to mention my 28 year old daughter had the CP vaccine and never had the pox. However she did get Shingles. She had this rash that would not go away. So naturally it was assumed it was a skin issue or maybe poison ivy which she also had never experienced Her Dermatologist took one look at her and said she had shingles and confirmed it is indeed possible to get it even if you have had the vaccine. We were shocked. She ended up with a very bad scar on her face and had to have plastic surgery to repair it. Sucked all around.
17555,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: In my early 20s. Got the vaccine last year.
17556,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Kicked me like a mule. Expect the worst and maybe it will not be so bad.
17560,Second Shingles Shot: Had to get it at 43 because I need to take meds for an autoimmune disease. It was a rough one but not as bad as getting shingles by a long shot.
17561,I am M32 from the Philippines Southeast Asia. I had a peasized swollen lymph node this last June 2024 that lasted for 3 days. I remember staying up late before that. I then slept then that is when I noticed my left armpit was aching and I had that size and it is also red. A general physician doctor recommended me a sultamicillin antibiotic for it and the lymph node subsided. The pain or aching comes and go and it was mild until it came back a few days later. Before that I had experienced intense stress and anxiety due to being angry at some family members. The stress was so intense that I felt my left armpit being in pain again to the point that it radiated down to my chestmanboobs and almost to the nipple. The right side alse started to ache and both sides are onoff. I also began having back pain that started in the middle where the feeling is like someone is pointing a pen on it that it is slowly spreading. Right now my back feels hot and also my neck but it does not feel like feverish that a thermometer can read it. I also have sore throat and think I have swollen tonsils since October after eating an ice cream. I went to two ENT doctors that said nothing major about them despite seeing tonsil stones on my left side. Both also did not want me to take antibiotics maybe because I might become immune to them eventually. One doctor mentioned about contrast due to his findings and prescribed me with a throat spray as treatment. Early December I went to the second doctor saying that my tonsils are like swollen but it is level 1 for him. He took out my tonsil stones and adviced me to monitor my throat if I feel any fever dizziness and any other symptoms relating to it that needs to be checked to him again soon. I mentioned to them about some lesions found below my tonsils and before going down my throat but they still did not comment about any of it. One on the left is round and whitelike and the right is pimplelike. I notice that it is been there since October. I have onoff sore sensation since and sometimes it feels like something is stuck on my throat or that it is a bit of a choking or pushing feeling on one side I think? A while ago I went to a general physician to this clinic I have been visiting since April. Most of the doctors there are general physicians and unfortunately there the doctors are shuffling based on their schedules so the one I have been seeing there is unavailable today he was the one that gave me sultamicillin. The doctor a while ago also did not recommend me to take antibiotics for now and also apologized to me that she is unable to help me a lot and that she is more on the field of psychology. Though she then prescribed me to do blood work and also reach out a psychologist for my stress and anxiety to which I told her I just went to one but may transfer to another due to my schedule difficulties. I will take my blood works or blood tests soon as prescribed by this general physician. Just a while ago I was browsing reddit and saw this that kind of scared me because I felt similar symptoms as indicated there. I am not sure about my case but like what is indicated there I feel slight feverhot body esp in the back although thermometer today does not indicate that it is rising no night sweats though the last time I had night sweats was in January or February itchiness at the back but it is fast and there are no rashes or even hives also experiencing onoff fatigue even without swollen and painful lymph node since last year December 2023 also to add joint pain not exactly testicular swelling but the part connecting the scrotum and groin as well as my upper groin near upper parts of pubic hair on left and sometimes right part feel like swelling but no bumps I also feel this similar swelling right now at the back of my ear and almost going down my neck this also happened since early 2024 when I feel stressed again and I do not feel any obvous swelling bumps on both sides no difficulty in swallowing and blood stools and I also do feel slight onoff tenderness on my left part of abdomen and sometimes on the right. The comment of the physician redditor was so specific that it scares me a bit today. I would also like to add that I took Gardasil 9 vaccine this April June and October. I do not know if they have anything to do with it. Though I had unprotected oral sexual encounter with someone in April before I had the vaccine. I am not even sure if the encounter also had something to do with my tonsil and lesions situations. I also have joint pain with fatigue sometimes later on that is still undiagnosed and I assume I may have fibromyalgia symptoms or rheumatoid arthritis. Like after I move my body like doing errands or go outdoors I get tired and those are what I feel later on even muscle stiffness. I will add more details if I can recall some more things to add or any updates about my case.
17562,"Reoccurring shingles: I've learned that boosting the immune system is the way to go. Maybe try adding to your supplements a bit? I took this combo of supplements when I had shingles: [<url>](<url>). It has all the basic immune boosting vitamins: B, C, D3, Zinc, Medicinal mushrooms, and Wellness Formula. I took them for about a month when I first got diagnosed with shingles. Now I'll periodically take some combo of them when I feel tired or am around sick kiddos. I feel like it has helped a ton and I haven't been sick (cold, flu, shingles, covid, or otherwise) in the past 6 months. The only things I added to the shingles pack were a women's multivitamin and St John's Wort topical salve (when the shingles were healing)."
17563,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1980 vaccinated. I was 14 my brother came home from kindergarten. A kid in his class went home because he had chicken pox. I was in the 8th grade at another school. Saturday I did not wake up. My mom woke me up at 3pm. I was covered in pox. shingles
17565,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: A lot of people die on stage and everyone always thinks its a part of the act
17571,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: My mother is practically bedridden as a result of shingles. She developed neuropathy and that was it. Edited to add she got shingles 6 years ago.
17578,Shingrix vaccine trigger?: I initially started having them after getting the updated Covid second Shingrix and flu vaccine in a 4 week period. Cannot say if any or all or none are related to pvcs.
17579,Yeah I did notice the ads about shingles being common after the vaccine rollout
17580,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I cannot completely recall but it seems like they rapidly tapered off and along with some shooting pains in my body did not last much longer than a week or two. Was your mother prescribed an antiviral such as acyclovir? If not it seems likely that neuro symptoms could take longer to resolve than mine did.
17581,Is there nothing in between Tylenol and opiates??: Gabapentin knows me out cold then I wake up wide awake 4 hours later. I had to open the capsule and pour out half in fact. It makes me so loopy and high. It makes me look both drunk and stoned at the same time so I cannot take it. Unless I get shingles again then I will demand it.
17582,RSV shot: Opted to have my baby get the shot and she had no side effects Now 7 weeks and healthy as ever
17583,Pretty long term side effects in ears curious if anyone has also experienced: YesI have ear effects. Had shingles back in May. Shooting pains from jaw into ear. Never had anything diagnosed about that.
17586,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had shingles earlier this year. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain but it was remarkable. Especially with how it would wake me up every 45 minutes. Glad Trish is feeling that to be honest.
17588,I was warned the Shingles vaccine would hit hard so I schedule a day off work. Had almost no reaction. So when it came time for the 2nd dose I figured I would not need to take time off. Boy did I regret that...hit hard.
17589,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I have got it on my hip and wrapped around my leg. It feels like hot oil has been poured on my skin. This is brutal. I cannot imagine it being in my eye
17590,The shingles shot killed me but I am glad I got it because my husband is going thru so much pain right now. Yep. He decided not to get the vaccine. SMH.
17592,Shingles: I have had the singles vaccine but it did not help much as my immune system sucks. I still recommend getting it as soon as possible. My primary care physician orders valcyclovir when I get an outbreak. Took about 2 months to completely heal up.
17602,Finally getting some lab results that are getting my long requested rheumatology referral in motion. Hoping this community may have some insight while I wait in diagnosis purgatory? 15 months postpartum I had shingles in June and a nasty case of Covid in July. My hunch pregnancy was the catalyst and the recent viruses back to back have caused flare ups that I could no longer ignoretreat as independent symptoms . After recovering from Covid I developed full body hives extreme itching and worsened joint pain brain fog fatigue and recently dry mouth and insomnia. I also have the malar rash on my face that comes and goes worse at night and when super itchy. Originally being treated as suspected allergy with antihistamines and 50mg prednisone. Helped but did not resolve symptoms. As soon as I started reducing dose I flared severely. My hip joint pain has reduced significantly since starting prednisone so I am back up to 40mg going on 3 weeks now.

17612,I have been on semaglutide for 3 weeks. First week I felt drained of energy and a little nausea. 2 days after my second dose I woke up with searing nerve pain under one arm and down my torso. I suspected shingles but had no rash. Week 3 I increased my dose per my doctor and 2 days later woke up with the tell tale rash of shingles. By the time I saw my doctor the next day the rash had spread from my spine around to the midline of my chest and down the underside of my arm. My doctor not the same one who prescribed the Glp said its one of the worst cases hes ever seen. He put me on an antiviral and naproxen and told me if it gets worse hell want to hospitalize me for IV meds. I am on day 3 of shingles treatment and have now developed nerve pain across my abdomen on my wrist and on one thighno rash in those places. Its been a miserable two weeks. I am due for my next dose of semaglutide on Thursday but am very nervous about continuing. Has anyone who is developed shingles continued the meds? I appreciate any input anyone can share.
17617,"[30F] Joint pain after first dose AstraZeneca vaccine, but not at injection site: **Disclaimer** \- I am a strong advocate for vaccination and believe in the importance of getting vaccinated. This is just a question regarding my recent experience. Some background details: - 30, Female, 5'6"", 150lbs, Black - Primary complaint: Joint pain - No significant medical history - Current medications: None - No smoking, drinking, or drug use I received my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 7/10. Approximately 4 hours after the injection, I started experiencing joint pain in my knees and wrists. The pain is sharp and intermittent, making it uncomfortable to move around freely. These symptoms have lingered for a few days now. I'm curious if joint pain is a common reaction to the vaccine or if I should be worried. I want to ensure that I'm handling this situation appropriately. Should I seek medical advice or are there any home remedies I can try to alleviate this discomfort before my second dose on 8/7? Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated."
17618,I Have been on Mirtazapine at night for insomnia for 1.5 years initially PRN then as it lost efficacy increased dose and began taking it every night so 30 MG currently and I Am adding 40 MG duloxetine this week. Started today at 20 MG. Nervous due to mixed reviews here trending negative but really hoping for that rocket fuel effect for my resistant depression and raging anxiety. Today I felt slowed down not sedated but slow physically as if I were wearing a weighted backpack. I also felt that my physical symptoms of anxiety were lessened. I also have neuropathy from shingles and a bladder issue that the cymbalta could improve. Also on adderall low dose how is everyone is blood pressure on cymbalta? Dr. says we need to be watching that. Thanks
17621,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: Oh noo Hope it will be a speedy recovery... are you fairly healthy? My doctors and google are telling me it can have an outbreak for no reason at all even in healthy people... So your first time the last time you had was fairly mild? I think my outbreak was caused by me starting to add chia seeds to my diet. After 4 or 6 days of that bam Had a horrific outbreak. Lots of google and other things onlinr point to high argenine foods or diets can trigger outbreaks. They said any skin that contacts other skin are the worst spots because of sweat friction and additional heat.... and for butt cheeks or male groin ans under regions always touching other skin UGH Good luck on your journey
17622,Shingles vaccine experience: This is the first time I have heard someone mention the weird pain happening later and it made me feel so validated. I mentioned in another comment that I had shingles in my twenties. Every now and then I will have what my brain says is shingles pain in the same spot I had them around my torso. Never see any spots or anything just a random pain that is unlike any other and then it is gone
17627,Second shot reaction was much milder for me. And anything is waaaaay better than getting shingles.
17628,What did it feel like for you when you took your first dose?: I took my first 0.25 dose two days ago fibromyalgia and MECFS and for the first time in ages I felt like I had a bit of energy and could concentrate like I did not have to drag myself through the day. I was a bit afraid of insomnia and vivid dreams but did not have those. I feel completely fine. I hope you get the courage to take your first dose even though it is scary to start new medication. Could you ask someone to monitor you the first daynight? That might make it less scary. Good luck
17629,RSV vaccine: I relaxed the day after the RSV as I was a bit under the weather and do feel like baby mirrored that. But when I ate he made himself known again ha
17630,Hi I feel like I am a very rare case. I am a 36 years old male for the context. I had one shingles event like 4 or 5 years ago rash on the thorax below the breast. I had some pain around my upper back which was neuralgia. Took Acyclovir or Valacyclovir cannot remember pills cream and it went away quite easily. Then last September I have had shingles with rash behind my left shoulder in the upper back in a stressful moment of my life. I took Acyclovir immediately pills cream and it went away quickly and I suffered no pain whatsoever. But a few months later... Last January I had paresthesia under my left arm no rash nothing else. I had the feeling that my skin was burned but I could not see anything. I thought about a shingles without rash but I did not know so I waited... It went away and then came back. So I took Acyclovir pills. Then I do not remember exactly all the chronology but I had phases of paresthesia disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere around my pelvis for example. Right and then left. And in the end under my right arm. I went to see an infectiologist and he told me that it is soooo strange that it is moving like this around the body... And the blood test maybe 7 days after the last paresthesia ? said AntiVZV IgG antibodies Positive 2640 mUIml The doctor said that the meaning was that my body was constantly fighting against the virus is it true ? He prescribed me a 1year treatment of 500mg Valacyclovir 1 pill per day. Since that moment I had nerve pain appearing in my right arm and that lasted for about 2 weeks. Another doctor also infectiologist told me that it should be a postherpetic neuralgia PHN and that I should stop the 1year treatment and do a blood test 7 days after to check the status about VZV. Above all he said that IgG means that I have had shingles once in my life and that it does not mean that my body is constantly fighting against the virus What should I think about it ? IgM was not shown in the analysis apparently it would mean that it was negative. And last thing I have to say is that after this PHN in my right arm I was feeling much better no symptoms whatsoever. And in my mind I felt protected and relieved to have this 1year treatment of Valacyclovir.. I did not want to stop it both doctors have opposite advices . But since this morning I have hyperesthesia appearing again around the left of my hip Despite taking my 500mg Valacyclovir per day. I am extremely worried and seek for your help I was already trying to manage my stress already taking vitamin C and probiotics pills everyday... And exercising... What else can I do ? Llysine ? And what about the vaccine ? I have read some people say it has to be avoided at all costs. And also I do not know from what moment I can start taking it... Because if shingles never gives me a break maybe it means I will bever be able to have it ? Thank you so much in advance for your help...
17632,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: I saw my Dad with shingles in the hospital for a week. No thank you I got mine only because I know I never want to get them and suffer the way he did. Know it will not prevent them but the duration and severity will not be bad. Yesterday sign is weird but yet effective in food for thought.
17641,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles covid and flu in a single day and yuck for about a day. i got the second shingles by itself and was fine.
17642,22F Got diagnosed with shingles a day ago rashes appeared 2 days ago on the waistline of my back. Immediately started my acyclovir yesterday I am taking 400mg 4x a day. Today I saw some lesions started to dry and scab however I saw some new lesions on my abdomen where I was complaining of abdominal pain to my doctor. My doctor only prescribed for me to take the antivirals for 3days should I get a follow up check up and prolong the dose? I am also a nursing college student I have to go back to school on Monday. I also feel like the varicella virus in my body got triggered due to stress.
17643,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I had them on my face and in my ear. It was awful. Get vaccinated, you definitely do not want shingles. It felt like I was getting stabbed on the side of my head every few seconds for days."
17645,I had to have infusions for an auto immune disease before the infusions I had to have the shingles vaccine because my immunity will be lowered 2 needles 2 months apart 280 a pop because I am only 60 I am not eligible for free
17646,My point is The vaccine may be tough for a day or two but you do NOT want SHINGLES. Believe me. The actual scabbinghealing is bad enough. The nerve loss and return is beyond belief The area around my left earcheek is still partially numb. NOT FUN at all. Get vaccine please.
17651,Update: I'm the woman who fell and broke my arm last month.: Oh my goodness you have really been thru it! So sorry for all your troubles
17653,Is keeping the cervix really a big cancer risk if you have received the Gardasil vaccine are HPV negative and have never had an abnormal pap smear?: 68 week difficult recoveries tend to be cis people who are not only much older menopause age or near it in most cases but also who have significant issues like babysized fibroids etc. These surgeries are much more difficult than ours tend to be. I even had a bunch of fibroids cysts endometriosis etc and still I am having to remind myself to rest at 8 dpo. You do what works for you. I do not see the point of asking a question and then arguing with people who answer it honestly. If you are fine with the risks keep your cervix and enjoy the day or two you might get. Just know that the recovery for LEEP procedures is significantly worse than hysto. 12 weeks in my case and if you come back with HPV on any of those paps you will be facing potentially a lifetime of repeated LEEPs. I would do a dozen hystos before I would do a single LEEP again. It is your body do what you want but I would never even consider it given the extensive risks and minimal benefits.
17654,RSV shot: It looks like you were upset because obviously someone should have spoken to you about what treatment they were doing with your child. But it actually seems upsetting because your child was sitting in vomit and no one was paying attention to her. That part is more concerning. The reason for the vomiting may not have been the RSV antibodies shot although it might be. I would be asking if she was overfed or what else is going on. Or is vomiting a side effect of the antibodies. You are getting the type of answers on here because of the particular way you stated your question. For me personally I was against the COVID vaccine because it was new and we did not have enough information on long term side effects but I do get the other vaccines. I also fought hard to get my child the RSV antibodies synagis every 28 days because those only last one month. We just recently switched to the beyfotus right before her 2nd birthday because I was afraid that they would stop approving the synagis shot every 28 days. They beyfotus is an antibody shot that lasts 46 months and our baby's cardiologist prefers it. My baby got the synagis shot every 28 days and still ended up in the hospital three times and one time she was on a ventilator breathing machine for several weeks and in the hospital for two months. She is a 26 weeker preemie and is on oxygen at home 247. Other respiratory viruses have put her in the hospital. It is not fun to go back to the hospital after spending four months in the NICU. The non NICU for your baby is so much worse. They have zero idea what to do with babies so you or someone has to be bedside 247 unlike the NICU where I felt comfortable leaving my baby. Your feelings are valid. Ask more questions. Find out why your child was vomiting and why they were left that way. And ask for more information on the antibody shot that was given whether it was synagis or beyfotus. It is possible that your baby is having a possible side effect. We had less of a reaction to the beyfotus than we did to the synagis. Feel free to message me.
17660,Shingles vaccine: Typically I react to everything but I was fortunate to have minimal side effects with this one.
17662,How do you know? There is no way to know how badly the child would have had it before the vaccine. Shingrix gave me a heart attack. Would shingles have been worse? People should decide for themselves.
17667,How long does it take for gabapentin to kick in?: I am on day 14 and gapapentin helps a little. While I am no longer in the worst pain I now have the most burning and itching. I also have a lovely new rash more like a heat rash on top of my healing shingles rash. Hang in there
17668,"Unpredictable aftermath of vaccination: Following my Johnson & Johnson shot, I noticed a sharp pain radiating under my bra strap and numbness setting in a week later. Concerned about the escalating symptoms, I consulted my doctor, who suspected shingles without the typical rash. Despite no prior history of shingles or clear chicken pox exposure, I commenced antiviral treatment. However, the numbness continued to intensify and spread from my chest to my hip bone, affecting the entire side of my body. The chilly sensation now extends to my face and my tongue feels peculiar, reminiscent of a numbing sensation. While researching shingles complications, I have found no information on nerve issues spreading as rapidly as mine have. As I await my upcoming doctor's appointment, I can't shake off the unease and wonder if anyone else has encountered a similar situation post-shingles diagnosis."
17669,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got the chicken pox as a 22 yearold and was really sick for a day before the sores popped out. I got my shingles vaccines since I am over 50.
17671,Shingles and GenX: Popping into to agree. Shingles is horrible. Had it on my face and eyes. Pain. Itching. Hell on earth.
17673,Shingles vaccine experience: This was my experience as well. I ve had both C covid shots two booster and annual flu shot shots. None of the hit me like Shin gri x. Even so the short period of flu like misery is far better than a shingles attack.
17675,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I got shingles about 10 years ago and it was the most excruciatingly painful experience of my life. I had it on the back of my neck and the shooting pains along my jawline were horrible.
17676,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles in my early thirties. Felt like someone was driving a hot iron through my body. It was terrible. I was also given chicken pox at a party when I was a kid. I do not blame my parents at all. There was no vaccine at the time and the virus was much harder on adults so it was a common practice at the time to give it to your kids on purpose. Time marches forward and we understand things better but at the time it made some sense.
17679,A lot of people developed shingles after taking Covid shots I believe this is why shingrix was relabeled for 18 instead of the original 50.
17680,Causal evidence that herpes zoster vaccination prevents a proportion of dementia cases: Completely anecdotal but back in my critical care days I cared for an unfortunate gentleman with disseminated herpes zoster who went from being a fully functional golf playing joke cracking 60 something year old to basically nonverbal and out of control of his body within a week because of the brain damage and multiple strokes he had as a result of the infection. It was absolutely horrible. This whole thread has me thinking about him and wondering if what happened to him could have been prevented. I don t remember if he had the vaccine or not but I m guessing no.
17681,Put me out of my misery.: 49 got shingles on my face Yes on my face Its was horrible Got the shingles vaccine as soon as I could once I turned 50. Worth the crappy side effects vs. suffering through shingles.
17682,"Got the tetanus shot a few days ago and now I have a red, itchy rash developing at the injection site. I reached out to my doctor but they haven't responded yet. Has anyone else experienced this after getting a tetanus shot? Any advice on how to alleviate the itching and redness?"
17683,I only took one dose because I thought it was going to kill me. During height of COVID no ERs open to treat nonCOVID cases. I had shingles several years before in my late 40s wnerve pain ever since. I still will not get the second dose of that vaccine
17684,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: yeah i felt miserable from it but shingles is terrible. a couple days of misery and its behind you forever
17688,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: To be fair I cannot think of an unnecessary one. And no the flu shot is pretty necessary when it has killed young people and viral complications are no joke. I have a family member who had the flu and got viral optic neuritis. Going blind for half a year from it was pretty horrifying. I do not get people who treat the flu like a cold.
17694,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never got it as a child was exposed plenty of times but never developed symptoms. Then when the vaccine came out when I wad about 30 I got that.
17697,My parents have a long history of being vaccine believing they because autism the flu shot causes the flu the covid vaccine is dangerous and now my dad is blaming a shingles vaccine his aging father got on why he may be dying soon even though his health declined after the period the side effects wear off. I got the Shingrix vaccine myself due to being immunocompromised and it was worse than many of the others I had but nothing compared to the chronic pain I go through with my diseases. To him if it is not vaccines it is GMOs grains or not going to a chiropractor or other natural remedies. He just cannot accept that shit happens to people and it is not always some big conspiracy.
17699,My husband has three of these spots on his body. Two on his back and one on his chest. Pictured is a mark from yesterday and the same one today. Tender but not itching. I made him schedule a doctors appointment. Looks like shingles but I read that its only on one of side of the body. Not sure if that is true. Hes 36 and quite fit. Any ideas?
17700,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Fever for a day and shoulder pain. I read about shingles getting into the eyes and got the shot minutes later
17702,I mysteriously got a fib first event with. Covid shot second event was triggered by shingles shot. No events since.
17704,Shingles Sucks: These were my survival tools showering and baths make it worse it is worse at night so try and nap during the day I thought sugar brought on an attack so avoided that strong lidocaine patches called Versatis  12 hours on 12 hours off so pick your time wisely gaming or some hobby that provides distraction and lastly weed. A lot of it. I got it in February this year and still have nerve pain. Hope that does not happen to you. Good luck
17705,So after 3 urgent care visits and 2 misdiagnosis later I have shingles. Not just anywhere its on my face and in my mouth. The literal only comfort is that my baby girl will get some small passive immunity to this crap for a little while after she is born. I Have had so many issues from this pregnancy and I know I should feel happy that I Am pregnant after my husband and I tried for so long but man I Am tired of feeling godawful every day. Its like every day is a new problem with my body. First it was eczema then the vomiting so damn bad I lost 23 pounds in my first trimester the pubic symphasis blood pressure spikes gestational diabetes scare now shingles. I just want a normal week where I Am feeling ok.
17706,Help my chickenpox diagnosis is really bothering me: Vaccinated people can get chickenpox too it is called breakthrough chickenpox. Shingles is just a possibility down the line. Sucks but at least we have that in common mate. Source Was vaccinated as a child had antibodies and everything STILL got chickenpox last year.
17710,Shingles shot Ack: I just had my first one. It was not anything at all I kept putting it off because I did not have a weekend to spare for sickness. So I did it right before I had to be home for days for a new roof to be put on my house Little bit more soreness than flu shot but really unremarkable. So you may not have a terrible reaction. My pharmacist said hes had more people complain about sickness after the booster.
17712,Shingles and GenX: I was lucky in one sense that I did not have much pain but it got into my eye and recurred and I still have inflammation from it after 4 years. Vaccinate early before 50 if you can. Also beware that stress can bring it on so manage that.
17713,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Done. Be sure to get the second one to complete the process. The second one was worse for side effects but not as bad as shingles.
17714,my hubbys arm got grossly red swollen with it but he said he felt fine. It took 3 days to pass. I chickened out and got shingles 3 mos later. Luckily i had acyclovir script and kept it from getting bad. Bumps no blisters for a month.
17715,First Shingrix shot made my aunt's Postherpetic Neuralgia from shingles 8 mo ago worse. What to do? Should she take the 2nd vaccine?: I got the Shingrix vaccine after my first bout of shingles. My doctor told me to wait until six months after all my symptoms were gone. Since I had facial nerve damage that was almost three years after my first bout. I have had multiple relapses of shingles since then but except for the one this year they were all much milder than the first. My pharmacist said that was likely because the vaccine afforded me some protection when the virus reactivated. I wish I knew the right answer for your aunt. My pain initially presents as headaches that nothing I take corrects so it is grin and bear it until shingles crawls back into its hole and plans its next strike. If you are planning to see a neurologist make the appointment now they seem to be booked up until the next millennium where I am. Good luck to you and your aunt. I hope she overcomes this soon.
17720,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My mom took me too many and I do mean many Pox Parties even had me hug the sick kids. Never got it. Got the vaccine as soon as it was available as she was sick of going to Pox Parties.
17722,: This is why I died and came back the night of my vaccination.
17728,There have been lots of people that have had a shingles breakout due to the Covid shot its not a vaccine and I wish people would quit saying it.
17729,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: I had absolutely no reaction to either shot. People have different reactions to the vaccine so it is good to plan it when you have a free day after but it may not affect you at all. And as others have said reaction to the shot is better than shingles.
17730,First Time With Shingles. Was Not Bad But Would Not Want Again. How Well Did the Vaccine Work For You?: In the US I was able to get it covered even though I am younger than 50. Insurance was covering it with no issues but the pharmacy originally told me insurance would not cover it. When I told them insurance said it was covered they said it was store policy not to give it to people under 50. I called a different pharmacy chain and they explained that it is only FDA labeled for 50 and up so pharmacists cannot give it without a doctor's prescription. So I got a prescription. My doctor says the vaccine will not prevent the rash but it should give some protection against the long lasting nerve damage I got the second time I had shingles.
17731,What triggered your BFS? Everyone please leave a quick comment: viral infectionshingles then the docs gave me so much antibiotics and antivirals because they did not know if it was viral or bacterial and a tone of corticosteroids to reduce facial and brain swelling shingles in my earfacewent in my brain. So I highly suspect the virus caused it and then all the meds I took destroyed my immune system and messed up my hormones and made my nervous system go out of wack I also had a period of weird irregular heart beats and unable to recover from a lung infection shortly after plus digestive problems so yeah my systems are all screwed. Now I am here twitching having nerve pain numbness and shocks for 4 months. FML. Never taking this much meds again. I am seeing a functional medicine practitioner holistic and Chinese medicine doctor to get this fixed since western medicine screwed me up.
17734,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Insurance does not pay for the shingles vaccine till age 50 unless you have had shingles earlier. People still get shingles with the chicken pox vaccine.
17737,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got chicken pox in preschool. I was three or four and apparently my mother had not had it as a child so I wound up giving it to her A couple years ago I got shingles at 30 years old. The rash was gross but the worst part was the nerve pain creeping from my spine to my belly button. It felt like something big was trying to take a bite out of my side. The gaba helped but it made me so slow and dopey I wanted to game and could not do anything that required fast reflexes. I spent the whole time playing pokemon and watching the pustules fall off.
17738,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I lived on a farm early in life before moving to the city and while my mother never did this I was aware it was done for Rubella Mumps and CPox by some parents as I recall. Chickenpox was more viewed as annoying and there was not a vaccine yet. And I recall that community thought Measles was not one to mess with...I think somebody locally had died recently from it. It was far less common to hear about parents doing this in the 100000 person city I moved to. I note this was also the early 70s and elementary kids were all lined up to get their shots. It was pretty scary to not know if you were getting a pass one shot two or also a sugar cube with something in it. Surreal to think about today in the age where you get your shots oneonone at doctors. I remember the three or four kids that freaked out had to be taken aside behind a screen calmed down and cried more or less quietly while they were stabbed against their will. I also remember being in that line twice in two weeks and getting two rounds of shots...thinking that was normal. When I went home and said my arm was sore again my mother inquired and found out I had gotten two rounds of vaccine I do not twitch much now. And the vaccine I remember the most the Smallpox booster. It was before kindergarten and hurt like hell while that bastard doctor poked about 87 holes in my arm And bummer about the Shingles I got it at 52 and so glad I could.
17739,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued : I received my first shingles shot earlier this week and I wish I had read up more on the side effects. The day after, I only had a sore arm. The 2nd day after I was fatigued and woke up in the middle of the night with the night sweats, chills, and upset stomach. Today is the 3rd day. I woke up again last night soaked in sweat and extremely fatigued all day. Doing a search on here it seems like a majority of those that had the shot were fine after about 48 hours. Just curious if anyone else had fatigue this long after the shot? This thing is seriously kicking my butt! Update: on the 4th day, I was back to normal. Those of you that had to suffer with shingles, I'm so sorry. It sounds like a very painful experience."
17741,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Got a bad case of shingles at 35..... Do not recommend horrific nerve pain for about a month got the medication too late so I just had to deal with the full shingles outbreak not fun
17742,I had shingles last spring a very mild case after stupidly not getting the vaccine. I find that some of my gastritis pain is in the same place sensation of tightness under the breasts. Anyone else have these symptoms after shingles?
17744,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Mine was around the same area and I still have tinglingitchy pain 6 weeks later on some days
17749,Considering faking sick on thanksgiving.: I would not let social media feeds influence your decision making. However it is flu season and the holidays are a common time for gathering which increases the spread of many illnesses of course. It is up to you as mom. If you feel like baby may not be able to handle being around a lot of people do not feel obligated to attend. For me i have family members that are notorious for unintentionally spreading illnesses when we see them but they have shown to be extra cautious with the presence of our baby so i am not too worried. Plus my baby is in daycare right now and i think she is much more likely being exposed to so many pathogens there than the family gatherings haha. She is also five months. I have asked family to update their vaccines though this winter. My baby has also received the rsv vaccine at her four month and while her pediatrician did not share exact numbers she said the prevention of the vaccine is pretty effective.
17751,Shingles vaccine: Your doctor can approve you to go early you do not have to wait for 50 but insurance may not cover it and it could cost a lot. But in the middle of a shingles attack which takes weeks and weeks to resolve think how much you would pay to be out of pain and then make a decision as to whether it is worth it coming whether you can afford it or whether you would rather wait until it is covered. My roommate is getting it done. He already had shingles a few years ago in his early 40s and it was just torture. They called his doctor's office from the pharmacy and the primary doctor did a prescription over the phone for it. So nice of them. The first shot is done and now he just needs a second one still in his 40s. I do not know how much they charged.
17753,Brought Hello. I was diagnosed with the shingles on Dec 13th. The rash was on my right arm and neckback and hurt on my right leg and ribs as well even though the rash was present in those areas. Earlier in the week I had received a cortisone shot in the elbow for tennis elbow and had some oral steroids the previous week for some poison oak. The PA who prescribed the Valacyclovr antiviral meds speculated that the combination may have lowered my immune system down and made me susceptible. Over the course of the next week the visibility of the rash faded but since I used all the vslacyclovr it has not continued to fade nor has the aching and itching on my arm subsided. It no longer hurts on my leg ribs and back of head like it did before but my arm and shoulder are still very sore. I just was not sure if I simply need to let it run its course from here or if some additional antiviral or other types of medication may be beneficial. My doctor does not seem particularly familiar with shingles treatment and said hes happy to let me try more meds if Id like. A little less than a confidence answer A colleague had shingles and was prescribed nortriptyline and gabapentin for the nerves. I do not particularly want to take extra drugs if its not needed and from what I Have read 34 weeks of grief is pretty inevitable no matter what. I just do not want longterm nerve damage Was hoping for another opinion. Thanks in advance. I take olmesartan and amlodipine for blood pressure and recently added diclofenac for the elbow.
17759,I Am fuckin pissed. My niece who is VACCINATED got the chickenpox. This is what happens when you do not get you are babies fuckin vaccinated. Now its vaccine resistant and she is at a high risk for shingles when she is older
17760,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Yeah I had shingles two years ago and it is one of the absolute worst things that is ever happened to me medically and I say this as someone who has chronic sciatica and a degenerative eye condition. So yeah. My first thought when I read the beginning of this was god that baby's going to grow up to have a miserable case of shingles one day and it would not have happened if her grandmother was not such a piece of shit. To learn that Trash ended up with shingles during all of this was some breathtakingly beautiful karmic justice.
17761,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I got them and have it on vhs video while at my cousins house. I also had Scalded skin syndrome at the same time so it really sucked
17763,However bad it feels.I guarantee it is nothing compared to having shingles. Went on for weeks and then many months of continued nerve tingles until I got the vaccine and now all is well Hang in there
17767,Shingles vaccine at 27?: I did not get shingles vaccine though it was never mentioned. I did get Shingles. It sucks get the vaccine. Since you are younger it should not hit you as hard as someone in their 50s getting it ideally. I Am 33 got it 2 years ago Edit If anyone does happen to get shingles get to an urgent care as soon as possible for antivirals you have about 3 days from onset for them to work properly working best the sooner you get them. If my grandmom had not gotten shingles I would not have recognized them but thankfully it was not as severe as it could have been and STILL sucked
17772,Sores on scalp: I had shingles in my eye forehead and scalp. I Have had recurrent nerve problems from it and itchy pimples popping up no pimples on scalp that I can tell but itching. Had it looked at once and it was not shingles again. I Have read in the shingles thread of some people having recurring pimple type things. Interestingly I Am on methotrexate as well. Dermatologist does not know
17773,30YO with facial shingles first time: I am on week 7. Take all your meds. My eye got it hard in week 4current... I take Tylenol naproxen and ibuprofen for swelling... Still have it  Just got steritech drops and second round of antiviral
17776,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: I felt absolutely awful after the first shot. Feverish, body wracking chills, my entire body hurt, just touching me was awful. About two full days of it. It was such a hard response that I really dreaded going back for the second one. The nurse wasn't sure about giving it to me and brought in the doctor. Ultimately they left it up to me and I decided to have it because I figured even if I was miserable for another two days it was still better than getting shingles. My reaction to the second shot was about the same as the first, maybe not quite as severe."
17779,It s never too early to get your shingles vaccine. This wasn t even on my radar. I got a weird rash and thought I was having a reaction to my new pen needle or something. When the fatigue body aches and unpredictable blood sugar started I decided to go to the doctor. Now the pain is kicking in after two weeks. Has anybody else had shingles? Apparently having T 1 D makes it more likely for you to get it. Any experience on Val t rex? I should be picking up the prescription tomorrow so we will see how that goes. I just want to sleep without my body trying to destroy itself for once.
17783,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I started working in healthcare. They ran titers. I did not have antibodies to chicken pox. According to my mom I had chicken pox within 6 months of birth because older brother. I had to get the vaccine as an adult. I also had to get hep b over again because diabeetus.
17784,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Honestly my first reaction would have been to break Trish's nose and got her arrestet for child abuse. Holy shit. I had chicken pox as a 2yearold and got pneumonia as a complication as is pretty common my lungs were severely damaged forever then. My whole life I had immense problems with asthma and bronchitis and some years ago I had to be hospitalized due to shingles next to my right eye as a result of too much stress in my job on top of that. Of course I got another complication although I did not lose my eyesight as could have happen easily I got a trigeminusneuralgia a very painful inflammation of the nerves on the right side of my face. I had to be treated for it for MONTHS and when the pain disappeared so did the rest of the feelings in this area of my face it got numb still is many years after and will never recover back. Someone that would intentionally harm or even only risk it my child like that would have to run for their lives because I would make sure they will never recover from the pain that I would give them after pulling such an act. And I DEFINITELY would make sure neither them nor my STBXhusband would EVER see my child again for taking another chance to hurt them. Edit typos
17785,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Well that just scared the beejesus out of me. My husband who is 38 just got diagnosed with shingles four days before this. So far he says the pain is minimal but the itching is bad and he is more bothered by the rash of the adhesive of the bandages. He never even thought he could get it in his late 30s.
17786,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: Good for you! I've had two and am on the five year plan. Last one I had a few benign polyps removed. It's not that bad, and certainly nothing to dread. The prep is the worst part, but even that depends on you and the type of prep you're given to do. I had to consume a lot of clear jello and Gatorade (as in non-red coloring) and vegetable broth for 24 hours beforehand. I assume you know how to poop, so that's 90% of the prep right there. When you do go in for your procedure, take advantage of the drugs they offer and let them knock you out. (Edit: my first one, I wanted to watch on the monitor as the camera made its way up. It had to make a right turn and that's when it got uncomfortable, so they knocked me out). You'll take the best nap ever and then you'll wake up with some cool pictures of your colon. Then you'll have the best meal of your life you'll probably forget, and then you'll go home and sleep some more. Just for fun, weigh yourself before you start your prep, and then just before you head in after you've emptied yourself out. You'll find out just how full of shit you are. So when someone says ""You're full of shit"" you can say ""Yes I am. Two and a half pounds worth, give or take an ounce."" Good luck, and here's to hoping for a healthy outcome."
17788,Shingles vaccine: I did not notice any problems after getting the shingles vaccine
17791,Going out of my mind: What vaccine did you get? Mine started a few days after getting Shingrix vaccine
17794,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: A skull fracture from just fainting that is rough AF.
17797,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: My friend developed shingles right after her Covid infection.
17800,Rinvoq and Shingles: Finally down to about a 7 my doctor said I had no choice if I kept taking the Rinvoq it would take longer to heal from the shingles and I do not need this to carry on any longer. I got the shingles on my right torso chest and upper back so I am struggling to lift my arm or anything on that side.
17801,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: COVID brought and still does bring on a lot of shingles in younger people. In 2021 after getting COVID that took me down hard but did not put me into the hospital I got shingles in my mid 30s.its happened to several others I know.
17806,Put me out of my misery.: That shingles vaccine is no joke Better than shingles I guess but it can make you feel kind of funky for awhile.
17808,Shingles vaccine experience: I had the shingles at 40 years old. I was in pain for 2 weeks. Could Not wear pants because just the fabric touching the lesions was terribly painful. I would have gladly taken the vaccine over this.
17811,Shingles vaccine: You know what is interesting? Just when I had recovered from chickenpox I got Bell's palsy. Like the scabs have just gone away and then boom. I wake up with Bell's palsy. Both are technically HSV so they have to be related
17817,I Have had shingles yes. Its truly no joke. Because you can develop shingles again I got the latest 2 injections shingles vaccine yes. I never want to go thru that painful ordeal again.
17818,Shingles vaccine experience: I feel like once you know someone who has had shingles you will be making your Shingrix appointment at your earliest opportunity. I was willing to endure any side effects that might come my way. Like you sore arm was the worst of it. The second one bothered me less. 1010 would get Shingrix again.
17822,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My mom did not understand how vaccines work and after my first round of shots she decided to nanny all the kids in the neighborhood that had chicken pox. Since I got the first shot that means I am immune And I mean like the day I got the first shot she brought the kids over. To the surprise of no one in hindsight I got it. It kind of fucks with me that I can get shingles and literally no one else my age that I know can all because my mother was stupid in the 90's. Like I should have been spared from this. I try to give her the grace that there was not Google at the time but it is hard when it is your health and body affected by someone else's decision.
17824,Shingles vaccine: Sore arm. My ex MIL had it and I never wanted to go through that. It is worth it to me.
17826,Supposed to switch to Kesimpta soon.... Nervous AF.: Your neuro should order blood work for varicella JCV etc before you start and recommend any vaccine based on that. I started Kesimpta in November 23 previously on Ocrevus from diagnosis in 2017 until discontinuing during the pandemic due to lack of information from old neuro. I always tolerated Ocrevus well and luckily Kesimpta was a much lower dose. The first shot caused muscle aches fever chills like a bad reaction to the COVID vaccine so just be sure to premedicate with some combo of Tylenol pepcid and Benadryl that works for you I cannot tolerate Benadryl but I have been fine with just Tylenol and pepcid. I did get three nasty back to back colds in the month of January so my takeaway is to be more careful during next flu and cold season with masking. But overall I love having control of the environment in which I take my medicine and it is easy to remember when to take it because I take it on the same moon phase every month. 6 hours stuck in an infusion chair for Ocrevus listening to other people have serious reactions like throat closing was really bad for my anxiety. The worst thing about this medication is the Styrofoam cooler it comes in.
17828,Except the measles vaccine never did. People decided chicken pox vaccines caused autism. MMR shots required only 23 worked. People who had chicken pox get shingles later in life. Son may have died due to covid vaccine. She has 2 movies big whoop.
17829,LPT People over 50 should get the new Shingrix shingles vaccination even if you have had vaccine or shingles: Same. My experience at least was that I only felt really bad for one day after each shot. I also do not regret it one tiny bit way better than getting shingles likely would have been. I still recall getting a bad case of chicken pox in elementary school and want no more part of that disease
17831,Shingles and other Vaccines: I had the shingles at 16. I urge you to get the vaccine. Ill never forget the pain I was in for weeks with lingering pain for over a year afterwards. One or two days of pain and discomfort from the vaccine is NOTHING compared to having the shingles.
17833,Shingles vaccine experience: I had my shots two months apart. The second one was sorer sure. Nothing Tylenol could not handle. Only a minor inconvenience. My husband had a mild case of shingles in his 30s and seeing that was enough to want to avoid altogether for myself.
17834,41 and got Shingles: I got it when I was 38. The rash was in my hair and on my forehead. The first doctor I said I was too young for it to be shingles and that it does not usually affect the head. She told me it was just contact dermatitis and an allergic reaction I Am allergic to eggs so she thought there might be egg protein in my hair products and to take a Benadryl and put cortizone on it. I went back to the clinic a few days later because it hurt so bad I was in tears and it was starting to crust and ooze foul pus. The second doctor who looked at it and said Yup that is shingles with a secondary infection. Turned out to be necrotizing fasciitis flesh eating bacteria and they had to debride the area ever few days for weeks plus put me on heavy duty antibiotics because he did not want the infection to cross the bloodbrain barrier. I Am fine now but I Have got a nasty quartersized scar about 18 of an inch deep in the middle of my forehead. Moral of the story never let a doctor tell you that you are too young to have a certain diagnosis.
17840,My dad who put off getting Shingrix and then got shingles reports that the side effects from Shingrix are 1000000X better than getting shingles.
17842,Remote Viewing woke the Shingles virusmaybe: Full on rash on the left side of my scalp required medical treatment.
17843,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got shingles at 42 years of age. The walk in clinic doctor told me to my face there was no way it was shingles he was telling me it was herpes simplex a fucking cold sore. On the back of my waist. In a big red firey patch. That looks EXACTLY like every picture online of shingles. Then they get the test back a week later and this dude sheepishly calls me and says yeah actually shingles sorry. You cannot take antivirals now because I refused to prescribe any to you last week. So I got to suffer for 2 months in the summer with shingles and friends and neighbors it is SHITTY I went to my own GP I told her I wanted the vaccine. She says it is super unlikely you will get shingles again. And I just stared her down and said it was unlikely I would get it the first time. Give me the shot. So she did. Go get the shot. Fight your doctor for it. Shingles has changed too it is more common younger.
17844,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: I had it both doses and STILL got shingles this January. Fortunately I figured out pretty quickly what it was and got put on antivirals. My case was fairly mild and doc said probably due to my having had vaccines. Even the mild case was pretty terrible. 010 do not recommend.
17845,Shingles: I am so sorry shingles is so horrible. I always say I would rather birth my child with no drugs with her sunny side up again than ever have shingles again It is Soo very painful. I also had neuralgia never painthe worst for a year after. Ugh yeah bad memories. I do not have any advice about taking the Mounjaro while infected though sorry. Feel better soon
17848,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: Yes its happened to me shingles on the scalp lots of sharp pains in the head
17851,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am sorry you have shingles. Try not to be too hard on them though. I had a friend who got chickenpox as a teen and it was extremely bad think pox in very sensitive areas and literally scarred her for life. That is what parents were trying to prevent getting it after puberty. Chickenpox is a near universal childhood experience for our generation and shingles as adults not elderly are still pretty rare. I hope you feel better soon.
17855,Shingles vaccine: Holy fuck is accurate. I Have had them.
17857,I do not know anyone who has not had a bad reaction to the shingles vaccine. But that is my limited view of it. I Am sure there are tons of people who have not had any problem.
17864,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never had chickenpox as a kid and decided to get the vaccine at age 30. So now I guess I could get shingles later because its now laying dormant in my body where it was not before. Its not possible to get shingles unless you have had chickenpox first because its a reactivation of the chickenpox virus.
17866,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I Am early 50s dysautonomia for 5 years now. I got both Shringrix shots 2022 and then 6 mo later in 2023.No problem other than sore arm for few days. I hope it goes smoothly for you
17867,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Dude I was vaccinated against chickenpox everything. I still got shingles last year way before my 50s and before I even became eligible for a shingles vaccine. I was under a ton of stress at the time to the point where it screwed my immune system doctors explanation.
17868,Shingles vaccine: I barely even had a sore arm.
17870,Shingles vaccine: got both and had awful reactions to both. but i would do it again if i had to without thinking twice. my brother got shingles and it was torture for him. absolute torture
17871,Get your shingles vaccine: The last time I took a vaccine I ve had ms for 24 years. Hard pass
17875,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 94. I missed the vaccine being widely distributed by a year I luckily have not had any thing else pop up from it but my bf had a form of shingles that paralyzed an entire half of his body for a little bit when he was 20 and my best friend had to deal with brutal shingles at 27 during covid. I Am glad they have the vaccine now
17876,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I Am a few weeks in and its better but still exhausting.
17878,Shingles shot: I just got my first one a few weeks ago and other than my shoulder feeling bruised nothing to it zero side effects. I Am fully expecting the second shot to kick my ass.
17881,I was so afraid to get my shingles vaccine I heard lots of stories of bad reactions. It was a breeze thankfully. Hope you feel better soon
17886,: So glad i stopped getting more vaccines for covid after 2 shots. I still got serious problems for months in 2022 and up till winter of 2023. Slowly improving but still problems walking etc. I am a retired scientists microbiologist immunology person.
17889,That Was It??: Chuckling because when I did my first injection the two clicks were so close together I was totally convinced I had not done it right. I felt all around the injection area expecting to feel wetness found none. A few hours later I started to feel the effects. Yup I did it right
17890,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Just got over ocular felt like I had a knife in my eye. Luckily I caught it really early and got into the eye doctor. He gave me some anti viral meds and it was not hurting in about 2448 hours. Wore glasses for a week and then back to my contacts. I also had chickenpox as a kid.
17891,30M - Why isnt the shingrix vaccine approved for people < 50 years old?: Shingles [seems to be a real problem](<url>) \- with PHN and Opt PHN being serious complications. There are no recorded cases of severe reactions in the trials - and its very effective. Theres I doubt an immune system based reason for giving it to young people and the incidence rate is really high (close to some cancers for older people). Given this - Im surprised we don't give the vaccine starting at 30! It seems an end to end win - any idea why that might be? Im considering paying out of pocket - so wanted to check if there was a real medical/biological reason for this
17892,Since April 26th my left side of my face has been numb. It is not visibly numb or droopy but it is definitely numb compared to my right side which is not at all. May 12th I woke to my tongue tingly very obviously numb. It feels as though I have been to the dentist. I have not been since Oct 2023 I call the nurses line they tell me to call 911 because it sounds like a stroke I do not because that sounds silly i am a 33yo f with kids at home I cannot just leave. May 14th was a normal day with the half numb face. But I started to get a migraine out of nowhere. Migraines are something I am familiar with but never out of the blue like that. I take 2 sumatriptan passout. Today I feel normal left side of my lips feel more numb than they have whatever but no migraine so I do not go in. I have been very stressed anxiety riddled as of late. So I could presume it is that. BUT June 2023 left side of my face goes numb. I figure it was wind blown from being on the ferry. But it continues to be numb for a month. I was literally the most stress free happy no anxiety in years person. Nurse practitioner said it was Shingles. But I did not have a rash or pain. Just a half numb face. From the left tip of my nose down the back of my scalp literally the entire half of my head was numb. No other symptoms. My tongue never felt like it does now. I have gotten migraines since 2014 give or take so I could not say if they were worse at this time last year. Wtf is wrong with me?? Waiting to get a CT scan done to see a neurologist but looking to see if anyone else relates?
17898,RSV Vaccine: Geez that TDAP arm soreness is something else huh? Mine feels like jello right now haha. My OB recommended my husband get one too and hes nervous because he said the needle was huge. Hes silly for looking at it while knowing hes next. Good luck with your induction I hope everything goes well. Thank you for your perspective 
17901,Shingles May Be Triggered by Covid Shots The Vaccine Reaction
17912,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Hey OP. Sorry to hear about your side effects from the vaccine I can sympathize but I recommend it over the evil that is shingles That unrelenting but more in particular. opportunistic virus attacked me due to stress from some major lifechanging events. To add insult to injury that creepy virus to hold of me just days after I moved into a place on my own. Spent an entire six days in bed and literally had to have people come here to carry me to the bathroom. I will not terrorize anyone here with the description of the blisters on my midriff that turned into open soars nearing the end of its unrelenting assault on my body.
17913,Please be cautious shingles is still a thing: I had a tiny cluster of shingles seriously tiny on the top of my hand once in my 20s. Could not believe how painful these are. Great reminder. Do Not underestimate these suckers.
17914,Is the Shingles vaccine helpful?: It was horrible I was legally blind for a couple of days until a Dr diagnosed it correctly and gave me the necessary meds. I do not remember the name exactly but you just wanted to point that out? No other input?
17916,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: It is only going to get worse as we get closer to November
17919,Is anyone here on a GLP1 medication and doing OTF? If so how do you feel during your workouts? Is there anything different? I just had my first workout after my first dose and everything felt a lot harder. I was very aware of how much harder it was because I did this same template earlier in the month and it felt totally different.
17920,I was diagnosed with MS in 2019. I have RRMS. It took 9 years to get diagnosed. They sent me to every specialist before an Urgent Care Dr decided he was going to actually listen to me since no one else would. I told every Dr I went to that my father had MS but because my symptoms were weird they kept saying it was not. I kept getting dizzy. My eyes were really blurry and I had stomach issues. My heart feels like it is skipping beats all the time. When I was really stressed I would developed Parkinson like tremors and my random muscle spasms on different areas of my body. I had my first MRI and I had 8 lesions. 2 months later my neurologist did another MRI and I had 10 but the severity of a couple especially the one in the back of my head grew and there was no activity back there. His words not mine I had blood work for Tysabri done and had to switch to Ocrevus because they found out I had JC. After first or second dose I got shingles so bad I was bed ridden for a month and on a cane for 3 months. It is been a roller coaster to say the least. My family said that they did not understand why I was so bad because my father never had all these things happen and even said I was faking it at one point. After my dad passed I moved away. Since then I have had health problems one after the other. I started having these spells. Initial EEG showed I was having neurological events. I had a 3 day EEG that showed nothing. Neurologist put me on another antiseizure med. I have Bipolar 1 and was already on one for that and taking Gabapentin for constant sciatic nerve pain from the shingles I have now had them 3 times on different areas of my body I had another spell almost a month ago and had to be taken by ambulance to the ER. That Dr said she did not think it was a seizure but said I had to follow up with my Dr. I have been dizzy since. Not just a little bit either. Sometimes I feel like I am beyond drunk. I cannot drive and have to use a walker to just get around the house. I am very independent and hate that now I cannot work or drive or do the things I love to do. I am angry all the time. I feel useless. I just want my life back. I feel stuck. I miss my dad. He would at least listen. We would talk about things and even though he never complained about some of his symptoms he would tell me about it and he would give me advice on how to overcome things. I have worked my butt off and raised 3 kids on my own. Since having this last episode I have not been able to go back to work. I hope this is not how I will feel forever because I do not know how much more I can take.
17923,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: Had it on my face at 33 the worst thing ever It itched for 6 months after I stopped looking like quasimodo. Get the shots kids
17925,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I am on week three of having the rash but the exhaustion did not really hit me until just under a week in. It is so ridiculously bad especially given how minor my external symptoms are. Fingers crossed we both start feeling better soon
17927,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: My husband got the vaccine as a child still got chicken pox as a child and just got shingles a few months ago. Even if you are vaccine you can still become sick goes for everything.
17929,Shingles vaccine experience: My anecdotal experience is one shot will knock you on your For me it was the first Shingrix. For my husband and SIL it was the second shot. For them the first was a nothing burger. YMMV
17939,"What could this be?: My partner has this (I don't even know what to call it. Skin rash, maybe?) and it just recently shows on his back. He said that he might be bitten by some kind of insect/pest. Hope you can shed some light on what it is."
17943,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: When I got shingles the doctor very loudly and forcibly asked me to take my glasses off and pull my hair away from my face so he could see my eyes. He then told me he had an 18 year old young woman in the hospital with shingles around her eyes and they were doing everything they could to save her vision. It's no joke."
17946,Rsv vaccine for 26 weeker currently in NICU: My son was born at 263. He got the RSV vaccine at around 34 weeks and was perfectly fine he is doing really well now
17948,Shingles shot Ack: To ease some peoples fears I did not have a terrible reaction and the 2nd was actually milder.
17952,Shingles: I Am off it right now due to antibiotics. 2nd UTI in a month. I feel like they have been throwing new meds at me since the beginning of the year with no warnings about side effects or risks. Let Us see what sticks kind of mentally. Adding to my list of things to discuss. Thanks for asking or I would not have thought there was a correlation.
17955,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Got mine a couple years ago. I agree my arm was more sore with this shot than the covid shots.
17956,Sounds like a lot of people are still having unprotected sex with strangers. PLEASE STOP IT There are people out there who know they got something and will not disclose it to you. There are also people who are not affected the same way so they might look healthy but do not assume they are clean. ASK FOR RECENT TEST RESULTS ask if they are taking prep get on prep yourself use condoms please. I was one of those people who thought nothing would ever happen. I caught both HIV and HPV. Before I was diagnosed with HIV my life felt like it was ending could not eat could not regulate my body temperature my shingles flared up extremely painful because it attacks nerves no energy. Then I was diagnosed with HPV and masses around my anus started growing. They grow extremely fast and made using the toilet next to impossible. Itchy blood and acute pain after every bowel movement. I had surgery yesterday to remove the condylomas and because of how much they grew the surgeon had to cut a big pieces of my inner cheeks instead of just burning them like he originally planned. It is only day 2 after surgery and I feel like I cannot do this anymore. And to make things worse my surgeon was not able to remove all the growths. So yeah my life is absolutely ruined I Am doing all the treatments but this virus has dormant reservoirs all over our body and could become active at anytime. HPV will also never leave your body at least in 2025 no one has come up with a treatment to get rid of HPV. Because of my double infection the weakened immune system is unable to do anything about the HPV and Its running rampant inside me more than likely will have to go back for a second procedure. I Am trying to remain positive but this is becoming too much for me to handle. PLEASE THINK ABOUT YOUR HEALTH BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING THAT CAN VERY MUCH RUIN THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
17958,Hello docs Thanks for reading this. My wife 45 has been going through a staggering number of health problems over the past 5 to 10 years especially after her second pregnancy. I will not even try to enumerate them here although if we get into a good discussion I am sure a lot of them will come up. But to give you a broad picture of what you are dealing with over this time she has developed Celiac disease Fibromyalgia Neuropathy Chronic fatigue IGA deficiency Depression ADHD Slipped disc Multiple cases of shingles Anxiety Weight gain and all her life she is dealt with Migraines Neurodivergence Very poor sleep I am not from a medical background so I do not know for sure that I have got these terms right and I may have some details wrong here and there but for the most part this is a good snapshot. She quit her job because of some of these problems and now confines herself mainly to her bedroom. My question for the moment is comparatively simple. One of the symptoms or possibly one of the causes of this laundry list of maladies is that her vitamin D is very low. Around five years ago her vitamin D was checked and on whatever scale they use was at a level 12 when the lowest acceptable level is 20 and normal is 50 to 80. They put her on 200000 units of vitamin D per week for a few months which I understand is the maximum dose and at the end of the few months her vitamin D level was 8. She kept taking it and the next visit showed that it was at 12 again. Clearly that was not working so they prescribed her 35000 units per week and 15 minutes of sunshine most days. After a few months of that they tested again and that got her up to 20. Then the sunshine went away and they did nothing about vitamin D for a few months and it went back down around 12. For reasons I cannot remember she switched doctors. The new doctor could not believe that 200000 units of vitamin D per week had not made a difference the first time and started the process over first at 50000 units for a few months then 100000 units then back up to 200000 units. At the end of this she was still below normal. She switched doctors again. The new doctor said he wanted to focus on hormones and cortisol levels and that is where we are now. She is due to go back to him next month and follow that up. My question is from my understanding a lack of vitamin D can because a lot of these problems and symptoms including depression which I often feel is the symptom to beat and I was just wondering what is the next step? The maximum dosage is not being absorbed and the sunlight is not much help. At one point an IV infusion of vitamin D was considered but apparently they do not do that anymore? So how can my wife get the vitamin D she needs? My hope is that proper vitamin D levels might at least reduce a significant number of her symptoms since it seems that low levels because a good number of them. So with pills not working sunlight not working and IV is no longer an option how can we get her body to absorb vitamin D? What might because a body to I guess suddenly reject vitamin D? I hope that we will get some good news shortly at the next appointment but here in North Carolina around these parts anyway it seems that whenever she tries to get a doctors appointment there is a threemonth wait so in that time basically nothing is being done. that is a lot of downtime between treatment ideas. I do not know her anymore. She stays in her room most of the time. She manages to get the kids to school then back to the bedroom. She comes out to eat some small glutenfree meal and then disappears again. she is pleasant and friendly enough not particularly cognitively impaired or anything but generally she is not...present. I feel like a roommate and her kids have never really known the girl I knew. I am just trying to fix it. Well this is way longer than I hoped it would be so I will stop here. Ask me anything you like and I will answer. Thanks for getting this far.
17967,"Starting rinvoq soon: Hi everyone, I am from Toronto Canada. I suffer from severe atopic dermatitis. I've gone through topical steroids, prednisone, antibiotics, and immunosuppressents (protopics). Nothing has worked, my dermatologist has subscribed me rinvoq through abvicare. Currently abvicare is helping me get ready for the drug by making me do a TB test, x-ray, blood work and a shingles vaccines (one of the side effect for rinvoq is shingles ). I hope this drug gives my life back. I plan on taking before and after pictures. I also plan on giving you another update every quarter for 2 years to see if there are any rebound effects from this drug after finishing the treatment"
17968,Shingles vaccine: No problems for me but then I have reacted to any vaccine including so many COVIDs I lost count shingles pneumonia etc
17969,41 and got Shingles: I got them in my mid30s on my back and it was awful. Fun fact I learned at the time was that because older generations were exposed to the chicken pox virus via their kids they were less likely to develop shingles younger because it was almost like a booster. Now that our kids generation has the vaccine we are not exposed to it anymore so they are seeing it a lot more with younger people. I am not a dr so I am probably saying that wrong but that was essentially what the dr told me.
17974,Vaccine injuries reported: A 37 year old female develops symptoms within MINUTES of receiving the vaccine is nothing to do with the vaccine per se but is more indicative of a HYPERSENSITIVITY reaction either anaphylaxis requires previous exposure and sensitisation involves IgE antibodies or anaphylactoid pseudo anaphylaxis no sensitisation required as this is direct mast cell activation. Could it be Mast Cell Activation Syndrome?
17975,Please ignore the days listed in the first pic. First pic was the first week of this rash on my thighs started as only one thigh approx 4 weeks ago. Doctor initially thought shingles even though I had only very mild pain and only for a couple days and put me on meds antiviral pills and antibiotic cream which did not help at all. The rash started spreading and showed up on the other leg too. Doctor said ok so its not shingles and referred me to a dermatologist. Unfortunately the wait to see the dermatologist is extremely long and in the meantime this rash is SO ITCHY and uncomfortable. I have spent hours and hours looking up all kinds of rashes and nothing seems to match. Does anyone have a guess? I have not had any changes to environment soaps detergent diet etc. 38 yr old female no smoking no drugs no drinking no medication. Pic 1 collage of first week of rash. Pic 2 weeks in Pics 3 4 5 current 4 weeks since bumps appeared. Peeling around edges of some spots.
17977,Shingles Vaccine worsened symptoms: I was diagnosed with moderate to severe UC last month. Been taking Bude s onide for last 3 weeks and was told to take shin gri x shingles vaccine to prevent getting shingles when I start treatment. Last two days I ve been experiencing all flu like symptoms. I ll report on my condition later this week but hope symptoms subside. Despite issues i think it s worth it to avoid shingles. Have to keep reminding myself of that.
17979,RSV Vaccine 80 Effective for Older Adults: Easy to say when you have never seen a newborn with RSV. I watched my son code in the ER and be resuscitated over and over until the neonatologist arrived to intubate him since he was too small for the ER doc to successfully get the tube in. He lived but was on a vent for a week while his twin shared the NICU room on the CPAP. Were getting our 5mo vaccinated for it tomorrow.
17981,Shingles: Thank you for sharing and so sorry you are going through this not once but twice already. Acyclovir US too and Valacyclovir are similar antiviral drugs btw. And yes having any chemo treatment will suppress your immune system and make you more susceptible to shingles virus outbreak if you have had chicken pox. Family member immediately put on acyclovir when chemo started.
17983,when did you first notice a difference?: My first shot I took around 5pm and noticed a difference around 8pm. I now take it in the mornings and I feel great the whole day. I also take my shot still 2.5 with b12. Its a wonderful combination
17984,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I got shingles at 48. Sucked. Was lucky as mine did not develop super far before I went to the clinic and got some meds. Had to wait until a year after it cleared then i could get the vaccine which I did at 49. There was no issue with the insurance or the place I got it no issue being under 50
17986,Husband has rash and blistersboils under boxer shorts. He refuses to get it checked.: I just got over shingles IN my eye and eyelid. Still fucking hurts
17995,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: And on cue the Architect unplugged her from the Matrix.
17996,"Joint pain after the HPV vaccine: I received the HPV vaccine last month and since then, I've been dealing with severe joint pain in my wrists and ankles. It's especially bad when I have any kind of illness that causes flu-like symptoms. The pain is similar to what I experienced during a previous bout of arthritis. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to the HPV vaccine? How do you cope with joint pain flare-ups post-vaccination?"
17997,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I have had 4 major surgeries ripped a tendon and broken bones and shingles is by far the most painful thing I have ever gone through. it is awful get the vaccination. I wish I could have gotten it but where I live they will not give it to you before you are 50 I got shingles at 41.
17998,I just wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful to anyone. I have found this group helpful and wanted to contribute. One of my observations is that everyone has a slightly different experience and that health care providers may treat you like other patients they have seen and not appreciate what your experience is. I am sorry if this post is too long. tldr to the extent that you have any neuralgia emphasize that in conversations with providers try acupuncture get a TENS unit and beware of Gabapentin withdrawals its a long difficult slog advocate for yourself and give yourself gracetime. My Experience 60 year old male never had shingles before and no Shingrix. Rash started on my palm and worked its way up my arm. I was not too concerned with the blisters and rash at first what really bothered me was the terrible knot in my shoulder that felt like I had overexerted a muscle which is what I thought I had done. I even went and got a massage I was so desperate for muscle pain relief. After a week and worsening pain and the rash spreading I went to urgent care and was diagnosed as shingles. I should have realized that is what it was but my ideas about what I thought shingles was did not line up. Turns out it can strike you anywhere as you are all finding out. I was given a rx for acyclovir antiviral and for gabapentin. Within a week the acyclovir did its job and the rash and blisters dried up and were just a minor nuisance. The pain in my shoulder however spread to my upper arm and was nearly unbearable. No sleep constant pain. Gabapentin made me loopy and tired all the time  which was ok as I needed all the help I could get getting any sleep. Took a second trip back to the urgent care. They thought I was drug seeking and were dismissive of my pain. And this is one point I wanted to share here. The provider there was only focused on the skin  the rash and what she assumed was the discomfort associated with that. She had no appreciation for the neuralgia. I upped my dosage of Gabapentin to 900 mg 3x a day. No one talked to me about Gabapentin withdrawals by the way  another point I want to emphasize. I subsequently finally got an appointment with an internal medicine physician and we started Duloxetine in addition to the Gabapentin. I also started taking Advil  up to 800mg 3x a day. Now three months later I am finally feeling normal  at least about 90 of the time. My shoulder still aches and is weak but no longer disrupts by sleep or other activities. Here is what I learnedwhat worked for me. I am not a physician and your mileage may vary  Acupuncture Cannot recommend this enough. Find a good licensed DOM or similar practice and go at least 1x a week more if you can afford it or if your insurance  HSA will pay. If nothing else you will have an hour of bliss amidst the misery.  Get a TENS unit. This was also a source of limited relief and I do not know how I would have survived without it. Pick one up on Amazon with some extra pads. Adjust the settings to whatever works for you at the time.  The most effective dose for me was combination of Advil and Gabapentin. Just one or two 300mg Gabapentin. No real help beyond that. Sometimes I would alternate with Tylenol. I found that the least amount of Gabapentin I could tolerate was best. The antidepressant likely helped as well. But just like the Gabapentin  it takes a few weeks for your body to incorporate and for effectiveness. Study how Gabapentin works and ask your provider lots of questions about it.  Gabapentin withdrawals were awful in their own right. I did not think I was taking enough or for long enough to create a problem  but it did. I had a week of periods of intense anxiety headaches inability to control my body temperature and sweating and sleep interruption. No one prepared me for this or even helped me plan for a proper scaling back.  I am not sure people who have not had it can appreciate the pain of neuralgia. It is not like other pain I have experienced and it was difficult to describe. For me the skin painitchingdiscomfort was minor. If I had to do it over I would try to be clearer in my conversations with health care providers as to the source of my pain and get on a treatment plan for PHN quicker. Having said that there is not a lot Western medicine has to offer unfortunately.  Hang in there give yourself a break take naps when you can to the extent that you can  avoid things that give you stress advocate for yourself with medical providers and stress what your experience is  make sure they are treating you  not just the shinglesPHN.
17999,"First Time With Shingles. Was Not Bad, But Would Not Want Again. How Well Did the Vaccine Work For You?: I am in a bad flare of Crohn's atm. My immune system is weak. Waiting to start Humira & I've been hit with shingles for the first time. It's mild, thankfully. My g.p. recommends 2 Shingrix shots in 12 months' time. Apparently, we're more susceptible to getting it. I do wish it wasn't so much out of pocket, though."
18000,Any guidance for getting vaccine AFTER a case of shingles?: I might have had shingles a mild case and not know thought I just had rib neuralgia and only noticed a well hiden blister late into the game.

18001,This may be long thanks in advance for taking the time to read. I Have had 3 canceled cyclesantagonist in 4 months due to poor responders. They switched me to a micro dose Lupron cycle in which I started Started meds on Monday 10 units compounded Leuprolide morning 10 at night along with 450 Follistim and 40 units compounded HGH. Also this day I noticed I had a UTII have polycystic kidney disease early stages but highest tier for progression Went for bloodwork yesterday 11 follicles all under 10 still which is wonderful for me my reserve is very low. Left there went to the dermatologist because I developed a rash on my back with some severe pain under my skin where the rash was turns out I have shingles. I Am 38 years old.. I had to call my IVF clinic to tell them I Am starting antivirals and they canceled my cycle. Told me that since i am contagious I could not report for bloodworkultrasound on Monday and we can start at next day 1 which who knows when that will be because it has to be at least 24 weeks out until these blisters pop and scab over then the next period after that.

I understand the importance of canceling as pregnant woman are high risk I Am just devastated.. this is like such a blow to my mental health right now.
18004,61 F. I have poly cy the mia vera and am currently on the maximum dose of ru xo lit in ib 25 mg twice a day along with low dose daily aspirin. I had the Shin gri x vaccine right before commencing ru xo lit in ib treatment in May 2022. I got an unusual livid oid sp? rash along with shingles on my ankle in January 2023. The dermatologist at MG H who diagnosed it said that the vaccine had protected me from having a worse case. I recovered and promptly forgot about the booster booster. Fast forward to now. I have shingles once again this time on my forehead. I saw a PA at Urgent Care and she put me on va lacy lov ir for a week. I asked her if it was too late to get the booster and she said she did not know. So is it too late? Can I still get the booster nearly 2 years after the first shot or do I start over again or what? The only other infection I have had this year is Lyme with bullseye rash positive IgM IgG treated with Do xy cy line and recovered last September. I am an avid hiker. My current abnormal blood levels are platelets 760 slightly low RBCs like 3 75 slightly high M CV new 101 slightly low M CHC new 31 slightly high monocytes new due to infection? 12. HC TH CB are fine. My lymph s are usually low due to the drug but they seem to have stepped up and are in normal range for the first time in many months. P S.

18006,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: This is one vaccine I will not miss. My poor uncle got it and has been in constant nerve pain barely helped by drugs for about ten YEARS. Half of his face was disfigured it looks like he had a stroke. He even had a new surgical procedure meant to alleviate the pain no result.
18007,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my recent health scare that stemmed from a vaccine reaction. Following my flu and coronavirus vaccine booster shots, I started experiencing severe leg pain, elevated heart rate, and an alarming rash on my back. After multiple tests and a visit to the ER, I was diagnosed with shingles, which has been incredibly painful and challenging to deal with. I've been on a cocktail of medications and treatments to manage the symptoms, and while it's been a tough road, I'm finally starting to see some improvement. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, but I'm grateful for the medical care and support I've received throughout this ordeal. Wishing everyone good health and safety during these uncertain times."
18013,A1C increased after blood draw less than hour after getting flu and shingles shots: A1c correlates to your average blood sugar levels over the past three months give or take the reading is weighted somewhat toward the last month or so and is influeced by how long your red blood cells live. The shots would typically have no visible effect on your A1c although they might affect your actual blood sugar levels for a few days.

I got shingles at 37 years old and it was HORRIBLE. The itching is rough but the weird nerve pain is nigh unbearable. I could not sleep for weeks and ended up becoming a weird crying mess at a friend's wedding after I mixed sleep deprivation and 2 beers.
18037,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: every time you get a vaccine your body produces an immune response to acclimate to the virus and build antibodies. so its natural to have a reaction and feel sick after a vaccine. it will not be anywhere near how horrendous it would actually be to get shingles. i hear the pain is debilitating.
18041,I had no side effects from the shingles vaccination and only minor ones from Covid flu and RSV.

My husband is 85 and got the vaccine I Am 87 and got it the old fashioned way. We grew up close but across state lines so it might have been a factor?

I discovered that there in hell on earth as I developed shingles. In my EYE and part of face. Now am suffering through what is called suicide disease after nerves in eye and on face affected.

18055,Recently I have visited a planned parenthood for a yeast infection where they discovered one small bump. The first lady told me it was just a pimple and nothing to worry about. I returned 2 weeks later because my yeast infection did not fully clear. A different lady looked at it and told me the bump was a skin tag and then told me it was gential wart. She applied TCA and told me it would fall off and scab which it did not but it did decrease in size. What should i do to figure out if it is a gential wart or a pimple? I also have my gardasil 9 shot
18056,Rsv after vaccine?: I cannot speak first hand for the vaccine during pregnancy but my 4 month old got the beyfortus shot and caught RSV from my older daughter and its been just a stuffy simple cold for her. A good friend had the vaccine while pregnant and her family all got it her baby is just shy of 2 months old and they made it out fine too low grade fever for the baby and a few days of stuffy noses but otherwise fine.

18068,I started taking .25 doses of Wegovy on March 7 and took measurements of my hips waist chest female neck upper arm and thigh that same day. Today will be my fourth injection and I have lost 11 poundswhich is great but I have stalled for a few days now. I took my measurements again this morning and I have lost 3 inches in the waist 2.5 inches in the chest 2 inches in the waist and 0.5 inches in the neck arm and thigh are the same. So while I was getting frustrated by the stalling my enthusiasm is now renewed Also I woke up on Sunday with a lot of pain around the left ribcage. It hurt to touch it hurt to walk too much it hurt to take deep breaths. I could feel it in my front and back. It was a dull pain that would sometimes shoot out stabbing pains. I was going down a rabbit hole of kidney pancreas spleen appendix etc. I even thought it was shingles because it is the same place I had it before but I did not have the rash. I was going to the doctor today but last night I decided to take one lastditch effort to ensure it was not the trapped gas that I have read about here which if you Google you can find that people go to the ER thinking that it is some sort of serious organ issue I did all the recommended yoga poses some of which HURT and gave myself a stomach massage and I immediately started burping up a storm. I woke up feeling pretty much normal but did the poses again this morning and have been burping all morningand I was down half a pound from yesterday. I also saved myself a 20 copay Gas on Wegovy is no joke If you have really bad abdominal pain especially on the left side where the majority of your intestines are coiled try methods to push out gasit might be the culprit but go to your doctor if that does not help....better safe than sorry
18069,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: be prepared the vaccine shots cand kind of knock you on your ass for 24 hours or so especially the second one. well worth not getting shingles for a month of misery. get the vaccine shots on friday. you can get them at cvs or walgreens with insurance.
18073,: I am so concerned about my friends who have had not only the initial shots but all the boosters as well. I have a 90 yr old freind who has continued to have boosters and keeps ending up in the hospital due to strokes. Her family are staunch vaccine people and never look at this info
18077,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: to be fair my stress levels were very high for several months around that time so i could definitely see how that could have affected it. i m doing much better now
18080,Shingles vaccine: Definitely get it. You do not want shingles. I have a couple of friends my age over 50 who have gotten shingles and they have big regrets. No side effects other than a sore arm for a couple of days.
18082,Shingles Vaccine: The pharmacy would not let me get the Shingles shot at the same time as my covid booster. I had to stagger them. They were worried about side effects being too bad and guess what...ZERO side effects from Shingrix for me. I had more side effects from the covid booster.
18085,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: My wife did this and was seriously jacked up for almost a week. Pharmacists and doctors may be educated but they cannot possibly know how your personal physiology is going to handle things. Do the smart thing and space that shit out people.
18086,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Feel for you. I had them at about 40. I am just going to be real with you obviously it heals and stops hurting but for years I still occasionally felt it like an ache. Kind of like a musclenerve injury where you say anytime my back starts hurting it hurts right there the firstworst...
18087,Shingles vaccine experience: I was no fence sitter here. I got the chicken pox at 22 and I still remember how horrible it was to get them as an adult it is way worse for adults than it is kids. No way did I want to mess with Shingles. When they offered it to me with my flu and Covid shots I said yes it was like 2 days after my 50th birthday. I did get all the side effects both times. But I am just prone to them I guess.
18088,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I had Shingles at 40. Do not recommend. Get it. Now. Along with any others TDAP Pneumonia Covid boost and flu Edit Check your gut for cancer too
18092,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: You Are not supposed to have them all the same day s
18093,Undiagnosed Shingles: Thank you so much for your thoughtful and considerate response. I knew very little about Shingles . I knew it was something I needed to learn more about but like many times I ignored the warning signs and symptoms and put off going to my PC until it was too late. I had mild symptoms of itching so I did not follow up with it. I Am on my second dose of VAcyclovir and have felt better recently. The nerve pain several months ago was unbearable. My hands hurt so bad that I went to a Neurologist and RA doctor. Neither doctor had much of a clue as to what was going on. The nerve pain subsided and now it has been going through my whole body. I am going to have to go through the Shingles posts on here to get more pointers on how to deal with it. I really appreciate your feedback hopefully you will not have to deal with more outbreaks in the future.
18097,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I took both Shingrex shots years ago without any discomfort. My arm was not sore. I never get sick. But back in January I caught InfluenzaA and I thought I was on deaths door. Horrible and goes to show you just never know.
18103,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: I had the pox when I was six and then got shingles when I was 12. The first shot meant I could not lift my arm above my boobs for three days without noticeable owchie but no headaches or flu symptoms so I am hopeful that shingles shot 2 is easier which according to the comments here is a 5050 toss up.
18104,Shingles and other Vaccines: Whatever pain there is from the shingles vaccine is so small compared to the agony of shingles. I Have had 2 family members suffer from shingles. The suffering was immense one was only 5 years old and it was on his face and in his eye. It took a year for him to fully recover as this was back before there were antiviral medications. A neighbor got shingles and developed post shingles pain. It was sheer hell from the time he got it to the time he passed away from other causes. Nothing touched that pain not pain pills acupuncture TENS unit seeing pain specialists except for IV morphine and that intelligent stoic man said he could not live all doped up either. The shot is no fun its actually 2 some weeks apart but after seeing someone suffer at a level 910 every day every week every month I was relieved to be able to get it.
18105,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Had them at 40. I was moving a solid oak dresser with clothes still in it something popped in my back and I was covered in the rash. Went to dr was diagnosed with shingles
18106,I got the Shingles Covid Booster and Tetanus vaccines at the same time. I thought I was going to die.
18108,Knew I had a small blister on Tuesday and by Wednesday there were a few. Initially misdiagnosed as impetigo and given antibiotic cream which did nothing while the infection spread to several spots on my left face. Now taking flucioxacillin and aciclovir after shingles was diagnosed hoping they work fast. Sometimes painful all crustingoozing and making it difficult to do my job. Finding that the combination of ibuprofen and Tylenol works a bit to dull the pain. No issue sleeping at the moment partly because the meds seem to make me drowsy. Definitely going to get the vaccine if I can.
18109,Beats the agonizing pain of shingles. Trust me. That vaccine is worth it.
18110,Shingles vaccine: Sore arm nothing else to report
18111,Health Update I Lost Everything: Ah yes. Something happened to a person I disagree with so I am going to make a random connection to my agenda. Good logic In all seriousness while there have been reports of shingles flaring up after the third shot it is still a working hypothesis and not properly evident yet.
18113,Breast Implants Are Making Women Sick Guest Dr. Josh Axe Ep 987: My friends son got shingles following his MMRVaricella. There are reports of this happening although its very rare.
18116,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: My husband 53 missed his vaccination. He got head shingles a few months ago and has what is likely permanent nerve damage and pain. Get the shots.
18120,FML... I got shingles: I was able to get the shingles vaccine as a 28 year old from my local grocery store chain by telling them I had a preexisting condition that would because severe disease. Did you tell them you have diabetes?
18123,Shingles Is NO Joke: Saw my mum go through it and the pain and exhaustion was all too familiar
18125,A friend of mine shared this I woke up one morning with a serious headache and nothing could explain it. The pain was work its way down the side of my head. Went to urgent care I never get headaches except during allergy season. The doc said I think you are getting shingles. I went to Walgreens and got the first shot to halt the pace. He said he never got a rash. Could it have possibly been internal shingles? Or if you catch it on time before a rash develops can the vaccine stop the rash from forming? I have been under the impression that once any symptoms begin it is too late for the vaccine to be effective. Is it even safe to get at this point?
18126,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got so fucking lucky when I went to the ER at 19 with a full blown 3x5in cluster of spots and such extreme sensitivity to AIR. I had a 2nd set about 3 days into bloom halfway around my body from the 1st that were also sensitive as fuck and the doc did not even touch me before he said here is your meds they will not really help the 1st cluster but the 2nd one should clear quicker. I still cannot get the vaccine either yet but I am counting the months at this point. Absolute worst experience of my life medically.
18130,"Anybody else experience extreme fatigue after the shingles vaccine?: Hello everyone, I got the shingles vaccine recently and have been feeling extremely fatigued ever since. It's been a struggle to get through the day without needing multiple naps. I didn't expect this level of exhaustion as a side effect. Has anyone else felt this drained after getting the shingles vaccine? Take care and rest up if you're feeling the effects of the vaccine like I am."
18131,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I have it now going from my spine to the middle of chest. It is been horrible. Painful and itchy. I am just under a week and it will be a few more weeks before I will recover. I had delayed getting the vaccine. I wish I did even with a day of side effects Also I have had chills and a fever....
18132,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I am 33. I had chickenpox so bad when I was 3 in 1993. It was in places like my ears mouth and private area. Mom said I was screaming and miserable as all he will. 15 years later at boot camp my titer showed I was no longer immune so.i got 2 doses of the chickenpox vaccine but still at risk for singles. June 2024 got the shingles
18134,What to do when the local drug dealer is your only option: Omg I feel for you. The pain will not let up without pain meds. I have to wait 90 days after it is completely gone to get the vaccine. The rash was not much of a bother unless clothing rubbed against it and made it sting. I live alone so I was nude for the first three weeks. Then I started just wearing a silky gown. Get the vaccine. That is what I am telling everyone. Shingles is no joke and the pain makes you want to take your own life. I have given birth to 3 children all of which were almost 11 lbs. One was natural because he came too quickly for me to get the epidural. This pain is way worse than that. At least with that the pain revved up then receded so I could breath. When the active labor started I at least knew the pain would be over soon. Shingles pain does not recede. It is constant. If you and your family do not get the painthat is at least a blessing. At this point in time I no longer live day to day. I live pill to pill.
18135,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I got shingles in my arm and shoulder when I was 42. It messed up my health. I had a bad case with permanent nerve damage which led to muscle loss. Since I already have a congenital neck instability the muscle loss made it worse. I developed crippling migraines. Get your shingles shot before you hit 50. Pay for it if you must.
18138,Shingles vaccine experience: People's reactions are all over the map on this one. Next shot might knock you on your ass for a couple days or might not. Actual shingles is awful so well worth it.
18140,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: Oh ok I got a rash on my right side on my chest and on my back which sucked because I could not reach it and when I did get aloe on it was so hard not to keep wiping it off when laying down. So you are well enough to return to the training etc? I feel like a new person on Day 14 of this crap. The first 7 days were so hard painful and somewhat shocking Rash is not gone yet but healing well. How long did you have shingles?
18141,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: Just got diagnosed myself highly treatable these days. Thankfully
18144,"Navigating Vaccine Reactions and Unexplained Symptoms: Dealing with neck pain that seems to trigger my dysautonomia symptoms has been a challenging ordeal. The persistent discomfort in my neck, particularly on one side, has been accompanied by sharp, stabbing sensations that coincide with significant fluctuations in my heart rate and temperature sensitivity. Despite undergoing various tests and consultations, the exact cause of my neck pain and its impact on my autonomic nervous system remains elusive. In addition to grappling with chronic neck pain, my health struggles have been exacerbated by adverse reactions to vaccines. Each vaccine dose resulted in a decline in my well-being, with the booster shot rendering me incapacitated for weeks. Furthermore, a reaction to a medication landed me in the hospital and left me with lingering health issues. Unfortunately, my concerns have been dismissed by medical professionals in my area, leading me to seek validation and answers through online communities and alternative testing avenues. If anyone else has experienced a similar confluence of vaccine reactions, unexplained symptoms, and neck pain aggravating dysautonomia, I would greatly appreciate hearing your perspectives and insights. Let's support each other through these challenging health journeys and advocate for the care we deserve. Stay resilient and keep pushing forward! ??????"
18146,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles about a month ago now. That was the worst backnerve pain I have ever experienced. I was told it is pretty rare for us to get them in our 30's but that we usually only get them once maybe twice in our lives. At least we got it out of the way before we got old old.
18148,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I got my first shingles shot, a flu shot, and a covid booster all on the same day. I felt like crap and was sore all over for the next 2 days. 2nd shingles shot... nothing. I'm glad I got it, though. I've known people who've had terrible bouts with shingles and the couple days I felt like crap were nothing in comparison."
18149,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: I would echo the other poster about the antibiotics. You should not need them unless there is some concern about the pustules getting infected. Mine took some weeks to subside and I had some residual pain for years afterwards. I would make sure that you are treating the pain effectively I was on neurontin for a while which worked wonders. Problem is that it screwed with my proprioception. Not good for trail running. Shingles can be brought on by stress maybe you have been pushing your training too hard? Maybe time to ease up a little and give yourself some recovery time. It is a viral infection after all.

18158,Dreading the shingles vaccine Everyone I know has a bad next day from first shot. I am such a wimp.
18163,I had my first Pap smear done about 2 weeks ago and they called me back to let me know that I had abnormal cells called low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or LSIL. Although the lady on the phone said its not a really something to worry about and that I should just return in a year to test again. I scheduled to meet up with an OB after the call to see what to do because I Am sort of freaking out. I have struggled with bacterial vaginosis in the past so I Am curious to find out if that is what contributed to my abnormal Pap smear? Does this consider me as being HPV positive or negative. She did not clarify that in the call. I Have also gotten all my 3 HPV Vaccines when I was young.
18167,I was diagnosed at 30 but had symptoms from 18 on. I am 57 now. At thirty En brel was just coming out. I actually got some from a pilot who had RA because it still was not approved for AS was in trials and work well. My brother was crippled from AS and I knew I had a bad version of the disease. Up to the point of biologics I resisted taking N SAID's. I thought overall they would be harmful long term. I think I was right. I think they ruin the body. En brel was such a lifesaver. My AS was starting to get worse and after two dose of En brel I was improved. for a year or two I felt like I was in complete remission. In time it started to be less effective but still work. My BIGGEST mistake was asking the Rheumy for another bio logic to improve my small symptoms. She choose Remi cade. After the second dose I got flu like symptoms and got off of it and took a pack of prednisone and back on En brel. But it never work the same and I struggled with flu like symptoms when I took it. Switching to Hum ira did not help either. Tried a few other ones before giving up all together. I learned what immunogen i city meant at this point. All these biologics are made from Chinese hamster ovaries. React to one react to all. it is out of laziness that drug companies will not use another animal to reduce immunogen i city. for 5 years I went without a bio logic. I suffered. did not sleep well felt poorly almost all the time. Was living with a lot of spine and rib pain. sporadically took prednisone knowing long term how bad it was same with N SAID's. Very rarely. Just held hope for another drug to come out. And it did. R in vo q. After a couple of pills everything settled down. I knew right away it would work. Felt like I did when I started En brel so long ago. got my LIFE back. Had an MRI recently The orthopedic doctor who reviewed it with me said I had an amazing back. could not believe how well spaced my discs were and how I actually had AS. Which brings me to my next point. YOGA. I have always done yoga knowing it was good for my spine. Even in my 5 years without a bio logic I struggled to do yoga but I did it anyway. A true lifesaver. How am I doing now? R in vo q actually started to wear off a little. Started to get tired. I stopped taking it for a week and really tightened my diet. Cut back on sugar a lot. I wake up in the morning and have a shake made of avocado sauerkraut two lemons and water. I only eat one or two moderate sized meals a day. Grass fed meat virtually no vegetables I do not believe they are good for our gut when we have autoimmune some fruit white rice not many carb s. I now take R in vo q every other day and feel very well. very little aches and pains that I use yoga to work out. Not flaring at all. I just have 57 year old guy aches which are easy to deal with. I did get shingles when I was taking R in vo q daily that was one of my decisions to take it every other day. With the diet being tighter I can get away with that. It work for ME. If I could summarize based on my experiences it would be to get on a bio logic stay away from NSAIDS and prednisone. Cut back on sugar and processed foods get healthy. Do YOGA and have an optimistic outlook to life. AS is not a death sentence. I am thankful for it as it is given me great motivation to take great care of myself.
18171,Being admitted: RSV is everywhere do not beat yourself up about it Our guy was in the NICU 31 days for respiratory failure. Two months later we were admitted back into childrens hospital after testing positive for RSV. He got the vaccine Wednesday and we were admitted on Saturday After lots of suction and observation for maybe 2ish days? We were released. Then my then 2.5 year old came down with it and it was probably the sickest I Have ever seen him. Dad was also traveling overseas for work If I Am remembering correctly day 5 is the virus peak and in time it will improve. Also respiratory treatments for a virus seem to be a bit different and more relaxed than RT in the NICU. Get better soon You got this I also highly recommend Dr. NoseBot that suction pump is incredible and we still use it and hes 18 months
18172,Shingles Is NO Joke: I would not if I were you. I am immunosuppressed from a transplant. I had shingles along the sciatic. There was no pain only slight itching and the rash. It was diagnosed as shingles by an MD. It is not worth if for me to get the vaccine and I do not even have a history of bad reactions to vaccines.
18173,Shingles vaccine: I just finished my second shot. I had no side effects and I am glad I did it too many horror stories
18174,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I Am nearly 40 and I Have had shingles twice. The first time I was 22 and the second time was 2 months ago. Both times majorly sucked. I know I Am not Gen X but anytime I can help get the word out for people to get their shingles shot you best believe I will
18175,Shingles vaccine: I did the first shingles and a Covid booster on a Friday afternoon. Finally started to feel decent Sunday afternoon. Totally worth it though.
18177,Shingles Is NO Joke: I Have got the neuralgia really bad. She doubled dose of my gabrpentin. It even hurts to breathe
18195,I Am miserable. I Am so freaking swollen. My hands. My legs feet face. Everything. I have carpal tunnel. I Have gained over 75 pounds. Started having brown gooey discharge a few days ago. Period cramps on and off for the past weeks. Braxton hicks like crazy. Hot flashes. Joints hurt. Today I started to get a little dizzy. My body is working so hard to support baby and myself and I feel all of it. I Am just so freaking exhausted that all I want to do is cry. Had my first weekly dr appointment today. She checked my cervix. Wow. That really hurt She said it was super high and I will likely be pregnant for another few weeks. Had to do the strep test. That was no big deal. Got the RSV vaccine. Anyway. I just came on here to vent. I Am so ready to be done. And the amount of anxiety I have on top of all these physical symptoms is not helping How Is everyone else feeling?
18196,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I Am so tired when I have shingles. My rash is fairly mild and my symptoms vary in severeness each time but the fatigue is always the worst part for me. Doctors just do not seem to know enough about shingles. This Reddit group proves it.
18197,My immune system usually reacts to vaccines and I Have never had the shingles vaccine before but I can feel my glands already swelling up so I Am going to probably be down for the count for awhile.
18200,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same here almost died. Except my mom did take me to the party and there was a vaccine. Really sucks.
18204,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Perhaps an unintended consequence or an unfactored consequence to the staged act
18206,Shingles vaccine?: Yep And the main nerve in my left jaw that runs to my bottom teeth was affected. It would keep sending electric shocks to my teeth. The pain was madding. The doctors said I got it bad because I am immune compressed due to the meds I am on.
18209,I got the shingles and the flu at the same time. It was a BIG mistake. I got a UTI a few weeks later. I will try to avoid get the flu shot this year but if I do I am going to pregame Vitamin D and Zinc and isolate myself from the usual suspect who get sick.
18211,RVS vaccine. Anyone know much about it ? Ty: My daughter got the RSV shot at her check up at around 3 weeks old post discharge from the NICU no issues and she did great she is 9.5 months old and has been around a lot of germs and sick people and she just recently had her first cold and it was a breeze so not sure if that had anything to do with it but glad we got it she was born in December as a preemie and they highly suggested it
18215,Shingles vaccine: My husband and I had both gotten the original shingles vaccine and thought we were good. Then he got shingles years ago and still has tingling in some areas. Right after he got shingles I scheduled my Shingrix shots. No effects.
18216,Every so often I post this. I Have lost 63 pounds and reached my goal today. It took about 3 yrs. I cannot smile fully due to Ramsay Hunt from shingles. Get vaccinatedHealthyEating
18218,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got shingles when I was eight. I also got strep throat and mononucleosis at the same time and missed a month of school. Three doctors came in to confirm my doctor's diagnosis because it is unusual in children. I got the bivalent vaccine as soon as I was old enough. Both times I felt like I got hit by a truck but that is fine with me. We had a friend who got them in his mouth and lost his sense of taste for two years. You can also get them in your eyes. My sister got them before she was vaccinated and was in agony for a few weeks.
18221,I have the second one coming up the first was ok definitely painful but I Have heard 2nd one come with a truck warning. My cousin said she does not care how big the truck is get the shotshe had shingles and it took about 6 mos to completely heal.
18223,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I Am 62F and put off the vaccine and paying for it now. Incredible pain in my right hip and leg. Rash started yesterday and that is when I knew it was shingles. Started the meds last night. I work fulltime as a kindergarten teacher and do not know how I Am going to get through the days with this pain.
18225,I never had a reaction to vaccines either. I Have had both shingles shots. Id been warned but a brother of mine had a horrible case of shingles. Enormous blisters and rashes from toes to scalp. Said the tiniest move was like poker hot razors cutting his whole body for weeks. vaccine
18226,Pro vaccine just need some friendly reassurance about the RSV vaccine.: My baby got it at 5 weeks old. We had no side effects or symptoms. When we got it the nurse said the only side effect they would seen so far was a rash at the injection site. Mind you this was midNovember. Hope that helps.
18227,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: My dermatologist recommended me get the HPV vaccine after my stint with GW. I can say mine never returned after getting all three shots. She said there is a case study that can actually suppress and help with GW from returning. In my case she was right. I started my journey in September of 2023 and have not had anything after my last cyro session of March of this year. Ironically it was the month when I received the last round of the vaccine. So my timeline was cyro in September follow up in October. A few months went by. Those went away to never return. Decided to trim my pubic hair and noticed one single wart did an additional cyro session for it in March then a follow up April and have not had one pop up since. All original warts and where they were are gone. Needless to say I am super thankful. I was mindful of what I was eating taking supplements and vitamins. I never smoked rarely drank. Just focused on being healthy and so far it has helped. Once the two year mark passes again next October I will mark myself safe from it and continue to be healthy
18229,Starting JAKi Rinvoq appreciate advice: I am avoiding all MRNA vaccines since this started a week after MRNA covid jab and cannot have live shingle.
18235,First shot was not TOO bad. That second one hurt like a mofo and it gave me a huge bruise. I do not regret it a second though if it prevents me from getting shingles
18236,Never had a flare up in his life gets vaccinated has two severe breakouts. Whether it somehow develops shingles or reactivated a dormant condition who knows hut either way it are not good and it happened...
18239,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had it and made it pretty easily. I mean it was bad but I did not have the opportunity to rest that much I run an organization. I had asked about the vaccine before but yes I am too young. They gave me two prescriptions I cannot remember what the first was but something for the itching I think and I got Tylenol 3 s.
18244,Should i get shingrix at 22?: I have had shingles twice in the last two years the second time with long term effects. My doctor said if I get the vaccine I may still get rashes but the nerve damage is less likely to happen again. She had to prescribe the vaccine for me the pharmacy said they would not give it without a prescription because I am too young.
18247,Second Shingles Shot: Zero side effects aside from arm pain here.
18249,Any parents get the RSV vaccine for their baby yet? on: Mine got it the day after birth in November at the hospital
18251,Shingles: Have you had C OVID? Studies showed the increased likelihood of developing shingles symptoms after an MRNA vaccine was statistically pretty low but developing shingles post C covid is statistically significant. Usually people who develop shingles as a reaction to the vaccine develop it within 21 days and have other health issues that contribute to the risk of that reaction.
18256,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got shingles randomly when I was 22. It was on my left thigh a little patch of bumps. My knee ankle and hip on that side of my body were super achy until it went away. I Am not immunocompromised or anything and I have no clue how it even happened. Do you catch shingles or does it crop up in your system randomly if you had herpes zoster? I should probably google this haha
18257,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox in my thirties thank you kindergarten class I subbed for a week I was very sick and miserable. My husband bf at the time and I had spent a day together and he wound up with a very mild case like 3 little pox. But ten years later HE got shingles and was miserable for months. Postherpetic neuralgia bad news. I got the shingles vaccine as soon as I was eligible.
18258,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I appreciate all the responses. Thank you very much. The first 12 hours were not too bad. My arm did hurt early on though. The night was a little tough and I feel a bit off today. I ended up taking some Tylenol just to help. So far so good enough anyway. In short it really sounds as if reducing the probability of getting shingles is the way to go in my opinion. Thanks for all the comments and information.
18265,i am not quite old enough for the shingles vaccine but would like to see if i can get it now. i found out thru titres as an adult that i had a subclinical chicken pox infection as a kid my mom remembers me having one suspicious spot. in my 30s i got a very bad sunburn that triggered a minor shingles infection on my forehead. it was luckily no big deal. because the amount of varicella was so low i was eligible for a chicken pox vaccine which i got in my 30s. can i also get a shingles vaccine or will the varicella vaccine cover me? i would like to prevent a bad case of shingles
18266,Shingles Vaccine: Currently going through that myself. I would take any vaccine side effects over going through this torture ever again. I am curious if we are eligible for the shot if we have had shingles though. I would think so since it is just dormant again but I will be asking my specialist when I see her.
18267,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: 26 are intelligent enough to not destroy their bodies with ugly tattoos.
18269,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I Am a military retiree I hardly have reactions to any vaccines and I Am sure its due to whatever likely experimental vaccines I received over 22 years. I took both Shingrex vaccines in stride
18270,GenX Shingrix: No reaction to the first dose waited four months got the second dose and absolutely nothing. I fear those mfers gave me a placebo.
18271,2 Broken ribs plus shingles equals ouch: They did not say anything about that butt my whole side of my chest hurts and when I sit up when I walk when I do anything I can feel the one rib popping and it feels like its trying to relocate itself. Does that make sense? I do not want to pee. I do not want to take a shower. I do not want to do anything that requires movement because every time I move I feel like I Am going to die.That rib starts popping and doing that moving feeling its the worst even with pain meds. It is the worst.
18273,2 doctors gave me 2 different diagnosis and I am lost.: Where on your scalp are your blisters? It does sound like your case could involve more than one nerve branch which although not typical is definitely possible. My shingles involved my eye as well but it started at the scalp on the top left side of my head and went to my eye and down part of my nose. No cheeks no mouth. Because your eye is involved you will need to be treated by an ophthalmologist properly so I would say to get a second opinion on the eye. Did your ophthalmologist prescribe a steroid eyedrop? I had shingles last December. I have some slight eye damage and still see an ophthalmologist every few months to monitor inflammation just to give you an idea of how important it is to get treated properly.
18277,I was not sure where to ask this and I thought this was the best place. My mom 60F asked me to post her rash located on her neck online to see if we can get any idea what it could be. She does not have health insurance so this is the first thing we thought of doing. If we can get an idea what it could be and what we can try to treat it at home that would be ideal. If it looks like cellulitis or infection we will find a way to get her care. It started out small last night 627 and got very big overnight and over the course of the day 628. Mom has no history of chicken pox so it is unlikely to be shingles. No history of skin allergies. There is no chance of exposure to poison ivy or any other plant that could because the issue. No pus or drainage. It is hot to the touch itchy and painful. It seems to have spread to just below her eye. She is tried benadryl gel which made it worse and vaseline which made it hurt worse. As far as she remembers she has not been doing anything differently. No change in diet or activity no new medications chemicals soaps clothesjewelry or detergents. Thank you for your time.
18278,More evidence of a failing immune system: So did a lot of my family friends and neighbours. If I remember right it was herpes after the second shot then shingles on the third but I think a lot of people had a mix bag after each shot. They definitely edited people's DNA and affected their immune system. it is getting worse too 100 day coughs Similar to HIV stage 2 horrible skin manifestations that are grotesque. Colds and flus lasting 6 8 weeks constant bowel problems etc
18279,Shingles vaccine: My wife and I had both doses. Zero side effects
18280,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: Not from what I Have witnessed. A constantly mutating infection is not compatible to a vaccine that is stays the same especially when the infection is not staying the same. My oldest was vaccinated every year til he turned 3 and got severely sick every time for 2 weeks. I stopped after that. I never got my youngest 2 the flu shot and they have never gotten the flu where my oldest has.
18282,Shingles vaccine: I had it in high school. Soooooo painful.
18283,We really upset by a Walgreens pharmacy today. I woke up with what I thought were burns on my body but they were actually shingles according to the doctor. They called me in an urgent script for anti viral meds. 4 hours went by and it still was not ready so I called to check in . They let me know that they have some medication on hand but that is for the people who really need it and my script would not be filled until the truck brings it in tomorrow. I asked them to explain further and then they asked me if I had some kind of emergency or something or was I totally out ? I told them I never had any I just got diagnosed with shingles. Then she said oh yes you actually need it then. We will have it filled in ten minutes . They did fill it and when I went to pick it up I asked them to help me understand why they decided to deprioritze my script when they had the medication here the whole time ? The tech held up my bag and said well you have to understand with this type of medication I believed she was referring to the medication also being used to genital herpes. I got so upset and with tears in my eyes explain how wrong I felt it was what they did . They did not call me to ask what I was treating. They assumed I was getting medication for something they do not deem a priority. Decided on their own that I could wait until tomorrow . As soon as I said I do not have herpes I have painful shingles they then deemed me worthy of medication on the same day .
18284,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: In the YOU.S. they recommend it for people 50 and older.
18285,"Feeling a mix of emotions right now. Battling Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis, I've been maintaining without medication for a considerable time. However, recent tests indicated worsening inflammation, leading my doctor to recommend starting on Otezla. To move forward with the treatment, I had to update my vaccinations. Following the Tetanus shot and the Meningitis vaccine, my symptoms have intensified, and I'm facing a flare-up in both conditions. It's frustrating to feel like my progress has been reset, especially as I navigate the insurance process to access the prescribed medication. Wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar setback?"
18286,1 SIL had turbo cancer currently in remission. 1 SIL now has asthma and arthritis. 1 SIL has myocarditis and was told it is from stress. All 3 competed to get the most jabs. vaccine flu tetanus pneumonia shingles whatever they could get.
18287,41 and got Shingles: Had them three freaking times as a preteenyoung teenager. Absolutely horrific. Take it easy and get a lot of rest shingles will really knock you out
18292,My anxiety is at an all time high. My baby was born at 36 weeks late term preemie with no health issues and a steady weight gain. I got the RSV vaccine at 3233 weeks. She has been struggling with breathing when lying down due to mucus and has a little cough sometimes no fever and a TON of congestion. Went in yesterday after feeling like the mucus was getting worse and they tested and she is RSV positive. So far no flailing nostrils or contracted breathing her owlet always shows the oxygen in the upper 90s sometimes 100 and she is eating and poopingpeeing like normal. I can barely sleep but 35 hours in two broken up stretches a night now I know I will not sleep for waking up to check her owlet stats and holding her upright. The ped said to put the pillow UNDER the mattress for elevation without risking safe sleep and she had a pretty good night but I was up all night staring at her. FTM and I want to cry. I tried to keep everyone out of the house and as soon as we take her out and about she got sick. My husband was sick Thursday of last week and she started getting sick Sunday so honestly it was probably him but still.I can tell she feels cruddy and I hate it. Pls tell me of all your successful RSV recovery stories that did not require hospitalization. Everything I find online basically reads as if she is this young we should expect her to end up in the ER. My anxiety is at a high and my sleep deprivation is not helping.
18294,My mother too. She Is has breast cancer twice so her immune system is shot. She had shingles one time so bad it was painful. The vaccine helped her.
18297,"Unexpected reaction to Moderna vaccine: After getting my first dose a few days ago, I've been dealing with some alarming symptoms. I've had persistent nausea and fatigue, along with a pounding headache that just won't go away. The worst part is the redness and extreme soreness in my arm where I got the injection. It's been a week and the area is still swollen and hot to the touch. Has anyone else experienced these side effects after the Moderna vaccine? This is really concerning."
18305,My friend who did NOT get any covid shots got shingles when his girlfriend got the shot. I knew it was from the shot that shared from her and I told him
18312,shingles??: I got shingles and Covid together about a year and a half ago a nasty double dose Like yourself I was really run down and exhausted at the time. The antivirals I think are a drinkable version of Zovirax. I had to drink them five times a day it was a bit of a nuisance but they were fine on my stomach and did not taste too bad. With the antivirals the rash cleared up quickly enough for me. I rested as much as I could as well and generally just took good care of myself for a while. Make sure to stay away from any pregnant people while you still have blisters. I hope you feel better soon and that its not a bad dose. Loose soft clothing will be your friend xx
18317,WHAT TO DO WHEN SHINGLES STRIKE: Not only did I get the antiviral meds my Dr gave me a steroid pack. I think it helped move things along. I did not have itching. My rash burned. I just had severe nerve pains in a few area. Cold compresses helped a lot. Pain patches did nothing. Extra strength tylenol took the edge off but nothing else helped not even Tramadol. Rest  hydrate. It does go away even though at times you think it will never.
18318,Shingles vaccination and pseudo relapse: Yes Shing rex was a day of solid awful followed by a pseudo relapse of all my symptoms for a few days. I was through it in 3 ish days but it was no fun. I feel you. Second dose was much easier. Discuss w your doc but yeah you probably should make an effort to not get shingles by powering thru a second dose too. They are so common and so painful. PS MS Hug sucks a Keep your chin up
18320,Be prepared to get shingles as well. I got them after vaccine
18323,Hello all.I recently got diagnosed as having shingles. I have had chicken pox as a kid. Have not had any vaccines in many years including any Covid ones. Last vaccine I got was a flu shot maybe 6 years ago. I am 41. In my case its been rather mild overall in comparison to some other people I know and what I have read here. I had a small rash about 3 to 4 inch diameter on left side of my spine middle back that appeared to be growing slowly . I found the rash by accident as it was a little itchy and I reached around to scratch it and could feel the little bumps I was like WTF as I could feel lots of little bumps grouped together. I thought I had gotten bitten by something at first or had an allergic reaction to something. I took a picture and sent to my Doctor with description and after he asked me a bunch of questions prescribed valacyclovir. I do not know exactly how long the rash was there but id say could not have been more than 1 week tops. The drugs seem to have kept it at bay somewhat I am on day 5 of 7 with the prescription and symptoms have not worsened. The rash is starting to dry up and itch a little Honey based cream help with the itch in my case I do have tenderness and sensitivity along the nerves if I follow from where the rash is on my back I can feel mild pain which wraps around the left side of my Torso and Abdomen but that is about it. I think without the drugs possibly the rash would have spread and likely a lot more pain. do not think I am in the clear fully just yet as this thing can hang around for a while if it wants but will see what happens. To all of you who are dealing with this crappy virus hope you feel better soon. Take care of yourselves. This was about as big as my rash got
18324,Shingles vaccine first dose side effects report: MCAS and hyperPOTS here. I am getting my first Shingrix tomorrow. I have been advised to never get another covid jab but all of my doctors are on board with me getting the shingles vaccine Totally dreading it but I am long overdue 59 and am even more scared of getting shingles so it is time to get it over with
18326,I was never offered Gardasil. Then when I heard about it I was not within the teenage range. Then I wanted to do this ever since I heard they up the age to 45 but I kind of got sucked into the rhetoric that it was a harmful shot with unknown long term affects. I saw many videos and claims of it being dangerous. Fast forward to now I realized how dumb I was to deny the shot. Like none of those claims are backed by proof. It could simply be a coincidence. I made several posts on reddit researching and everyone supported it. I wanted to see if anyone had a terrible experience but that was not the case. My biggest worry was infertility claims but I found out also getting hpv could because that. I also thought of how easy it is to make a lawsuit and everything in the medical world has lawsuits. Harald zur Hausenwon the 2008 Noble Price in 2008 due to his discovery on the because of cervical cancer being hpv. There are still many ways someone could get hpv. So yesterday I booked my appointment at uHealth Walgreens and I finally started the series. I usually do not mind shots yet I was a tiny bit scared getting the shot because of what I read on reddit that it was the most painful felt like battery acid some fainted had a seizure due to it. I did it on my nondominant arm. Honestly I just felt the needle pinch and a little something of the injection juice but that was it. I felt normal my arm was maybe a tiny bit sore if I lifted it up or it may be the bendaid. Now I need the 2nd shot in 2 months and the last in 6 months. Please talk to your doctor about Gardasil if you missed it as a teenager
18329,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had shingles in my late 20s. For what it is worth weed made it just an annoying rash and not debilitating.
18331,"Shingles Vaccine: I had all my vaccines at least 1 week apart to be cautious about reactions. The first dose of Shingrix was fine, my arm hurt for a week, but that's it (all my other vaccines had the same reaction). The second dose was hell for 24 hours. Highest fever I ever had in my life and chills that were so bad that I couldn't get up from the bed to get ibuprofen to try and bring the fever down. I was just shaking too much to stand. Never had anything like that in my life. I was worried I caught covid, but it was completely gone the next day, so obviously a vaccine reaction. Unfortunately it left some occasional weird paresthesia in my left leg, apparently it triggered my MS a bit. So I'd recommend to have your ibuprofen ready and take it immediately when the fever starts, so the inflammatory reaction is not as bad. I was unprepared (since all my other vaccines went so smoothly) until I couldn't take the medication anymore, do not recommend. Still glad that I'm protected from shingles now though, I heard it sucks a lot."
18332,Shingles Vaccine?: So my wife got the shingles vaccine Shingrixand subsequently... got shingles. She is still recovering from it 6 months later she is a double lung transplant patient but it was awful and she ended up going in the hospital. And while none of the local doctors will come out and admit it I do not expect them to they are held to the fire by big pharma her transplant doc essentially confirmed that was the because. And she was not around anyone that had anything close to even a pimple let alone full blown shingles so just some basic coincidence narrowed it down. Now of course I was around her while she went through having shingles and did not come away with it I have not gotten the vaccine.. nor will I. I am not vaccine by any stretch and get the flu shot but feel that you should have ALL the information so you can make the best decision for you. If we had to do it again we would NOT get the vaccine.. but.. again that is just our situation.
18334,Got my Shingles vaccine today. Sleepy. No pain yet. How soon were you all feeling pain??
18341,I am genuinely scared of covid now.: I got shingles at 44 after being infected a feed months earlier. It was the worst skin pain that I Have ever felt. I could not shower or lay my head on side for several days.
18344,Shingles vaccine: I did not feel great after my shots but its totally tolerable. Just gives you an excuse to watch TV all day.
18345,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: I would be inclined to blame her jeans.
18346,Shingles can light years worse than any vaccine reaction you will have. Its just scary if you have never had a bad reaction before. It was for me anyway.
18347,Hope you are ok. Had flu jab two weeks ago and was not going to have Covid as it flares my autoimmune conditions but Liver consultant advised me to have it. Also having Shingles vac. I Am a living pin cushion.
18348,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Suck it up, buttercup. I thought this was GenX? Didn't you drink out of a hose and ride a bike without a helmet and drink trash can punch? Remember who you are, rub some dirt on it and walk it off."
18354,I am currently at 80 combined 70ptsd 30chronic sinusitis 10tinnitus 10 shingles I was stationed at a base that had a burn pit and ended up with a bunch of nodules in my sinus cavities now I am in and out of the hospital for sarcoidosis with erythema nodosum. I see that just getting meds for it puts a person at 30 but this is affecting me pretty badly as I am on a decent dose of prednisone daily for now. I want to file for a claim but I am wondering if I even need a nexus letter if it falls under the pact act and if I need to do anything special to go to 100?
18356,"Does this look like Shingles or an infection?: Sex: F Age: 46 I have had chicken pox (I was a kid before the vaccine) Ok, so I got a rash going around under my breast around my chest to the back. It stops at the middle of my chest and at my spine. It started friday from what I can tell just one sore that crusted over by the end of friday with some red lines near it but by the end of the day it looked more like a rash. I don't know when the back part showed up but next day it was on the back. It does feel very nerve pain like but not as bad as I hear shingle described (it doesn't have me not able to do anything but it is very sensitive, even the small dots are very sensitive). My lymph nodes are swollen (i think on friday it even felt like the ones under my jaw but the one that felt the worst and still seems bad is the one on the side of the rash). I put in two pics of the front and side (sorry for the edited photo. I wanted to just crop but didn't know how to do that so I just blacked out irrelevant parts to highlight the rash. I don't really have a good way to take a pic of hte back as right now I have no one around to take it for me). I do have a video doc tomorrow but I'm a hypochondriac and (bacterial) infection freaks me out so would be nice to know from a doc this is most likely not an infection (and honestly everything I've looked up really points to it being shingles). [<url>](<url>) (Front view) [<url>](<url>) (Side view)"
18359,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I get shingles every time I get a COVID vaccine. Nurse practitioner says it is a coincidence. Doctor believed the same theory as you though so I stock up on antivirals before a booster.
18360,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I got shingles at 12 it left nerve damage where is t showed up. I get tingling when stressed. That was not a fun time. But I did not have the options for vaccines against chicken pox or shingles then. You are mom is a mega idiot for doing this to you.
18362,I got my second shingles vaccine today. Please someone come take care of me. I have a horrible case of the ManFlu and need help.
18365,"1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Yeah, it is a kick in the nuts. But I was military for 22 years and had to get the anthrax shot. That mother is like getting hit in the arm with a baseball bat. Trust me shingle.is not joke but nothing compared to anthrax. Lucky I got out of the small pox shot that is probably the worst I know."
18366,Severe IBSD flare up out of nowhere .... or maybe as a result of: It is possible. Any COVID vaccinebooster I have had have caused the worse IBSD flare ups.
18369,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I had them at 34. It was terrible. The blisters were painful and ooglie to look at my energy was shot and my appetite increased for sweets like nonstop for about a month smh. I got the infection whilst staying at a decent chain motel. Does not matter if the room is clean. At checkin always ask the motel desk clerk or concierge for you fancies lol for a set of newclean sheets and towels before you go to your room. Change them as soon as you get in there. Whilst you are at some minor housekeeping go ahead and do a quick wipe down of everything that requires major handhandling or that you sit your bum on with some antibacterial wipes . Stay shingle and cooties free people .
18372,Thanks for the reminder I am about due. If I recall I did not really have a reaction to the shingles vaccine.
18375,"Opthalmic shingles & Shingrix: For those of you with a history of ophthalmic shingles (HZO), has your opthamologist recommended getting Shingrix or not? There were some anecdotal reports of keratitis returning with the previous vaccine and I'm wondering what docs are recommending with Shingrix. (My opthalmologist said go ahead with Shingrix but I recently saw a corneal specialist and I'm waiting to hear back from her on this issue. I recently came across [Harvard's Ask an Expert column](<url>) on this which got me concerned.)"
18379,Has anyone gotten shingles days after getting the Shingrix shot? I did. Just wondering if anyone else has had this experience. I'm mid 50's --husband had same shingrix shot same day and did fine.
18381,has this happened to anyone else after their shot? how long did it last?
18382,Because of shingles other than stress?: My autoimmune disease caused me to get shingles
18383,I know so many who got shingles after having covid vaccine
18385,Shingrix: I Am not on those meds but had the two part Shingrix vaccine on my rheumatologists recommendation not long after it came out. I did not have any problems. You do not want shingles. My dad had it and it was brutal. A coworkers mother got shingles it went into her eye and she died. So while its mostly a very painful nuisance apparently it can have tragic consequences.
18386,Put me out of my misery.: I got shingles in my 40's. First shingles vaccine as well as a covid booster together a few years ago. Getting shingles was much worse and lasted nearly two weeks.
18390,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had shingles on my neck near my ear and in my throat. I Have been dealing with constant head pressure brain shocks and other strange head sensations since then. Its been about 6 weeks now.I was just prescribed gabapentin and ordered to get a brain MRI. Your mom is not alone.
18393,My baby has RSV and i am super scared: I Am so sorry you are going through this. RSV can be really scary. Do you feel confident in your pediatricians advice? If you trust them follow their advice for monitoring your baby at home. But most importantly trust your instincts to do whatever you think its the best for your baby. If your babys cough continues or worsens it might be a good idea to seek a second opinion at the hospital. And if your baby shows any signs of difficulty breathing take him to the ER immediately. Are you in the YOU.S.? If so did your pediatrician mention the RSV vaccine as a preventive option? It used to be available only for highrisk babies due to limited availability but its now accessible for everyone. This might be something to consider for next winter. My baby is 9 months and a month ago she got RSV shot. Its a seasonal vaccine and no side effects. Its going to be okay. Just keep offering your baby plenty of fluids and solids to stay hydrated. Also do not let anyone kiss your baby now or when he recovers.
18395,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Got shingles as an immunosuppressed 8 month pregnant lady in my inner thigh chasing toddlers around and crying. The most pain I Have ever been in. Awful.
18399,Shingrix: The vaccine for shingles was the worst for side effects. But its way better than getting shingles which I have had Cannot comment on the meds involved though as I was not on anything at the time of vaccination.
18400,My parents doctor convinced them to get the Shingles vaccine last month. Want To take a guess at who has Shingles?
18402,41 and got Shingles: I got it at 35. Woke up with a sore shoulder one day and blamed it on pulling the snowblower cord too hard the day before. The pain got worse to the point that it caused lost sleep and then finally a couple of days later a rash started on my chest and upper back.
18406,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: Yeah I have and they said there is nothing they could do. I have been to muti ent. No one seems to care about an invisible disease
18409,How do you handle infants during flu and RSV season?: my 7 week old had the RSV vaccine 2 weeks was discharged from the NICU 2 weeks so we got it before he left. were in illinois.
18414,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: I feel for you so much. But please know that you are not crazy and that this will probably get better. This past January I got shingles for the third time. I got it the first time at 41 then again at 50 and again at 52 anyway the first two times I bounced back pretty quickly. This past time was exhausted for two months. I thought for sure something terrible was wrong with me. I got tested for everything. My family doctor told me that I should be feeling better but I just was not. I even began to wonder if it was psychosomatic. I had to fight to stay awake past 630 PM. I had about 90 minutes of productivity per day. Finally the exhaustion lifted. I was telling a friend how I could not figure out what was wrong with me and she said You had shingles. It was the shingles. Looking back I think she was right. Rest when you can. This will probably get better.
18419,My experience as a PsA patient on MTX who got the flu COVID and shingles vaccine all at once.: This is so funny. I got shingles and HPV vaccines on Tuesday nearly identical symptoms and back to normal today. I also take inflectra infusion indomethacin prednisone and otezla. If on a biologic vaccines need to be done in the middle of the biologic dose. I Am also skipping my methotrexate this week while its not mandatory its been suggested as a good idea. So hoping I can make it a week without it. Good info OP
18422,Today I got the shingles vaccine and my second daughter got the HPV vaccine. So far we have not experienced any side effects which is a relief. 2 5
18424,Shingles vaccine: 18 months post liver transplant and Mayo is recommending shingles vaccine. I had chicken pox in my teenage years so I'm leaning towards getting the vaccine. Anyone have experience or opinions on this? Thanks
18425,First time shingles: Your symptoms are similar to mine.
18427,Good morning I was recently diagnosed with RA. I Am still in an emotional whirlwind over this and trying to process what this actually means. I Am a healthy or so I thought 40 year old who tore his ACLmeniscus around a decade ago while playing basketball. I had surgery that repaired everything soon after. No major issues since but occasionally my knees would swell in the back after walking. This would usually resolve within a few hours. In December I contracted COVID and my surgically repaired knee began swellingfeeling tight even if I did not do any exercise. I checked Dr. Google which suggested a Bakers cyst which was confirmed by my orthopedic surgeon soon after. I began researching these cysts on my own and discovered that they are usually caused by a torn meniscus or athritis. An MRI showed the ligaments and tendons to be in tiptop shape. On my own volition I contacted a rheumatoid doctor who took blood work and two weeks later yesterday told me that I tested negative for all antibodies associated with RA except for AntiCarP which was elevated and proves that I have RA. She strongly suggests that I get vaccinated for shingles and something else before I begin methotrexate. The thing is I do not feel bad at all. Rheumatoid doctor said she was surprised by the blood work but is 100 confident in diagnosis and that I should begin the regimen quickly to avoid the looming damage. She also said people testing positive for this antibody is rare. Is there anyway that this antibody test was a fluke? If not does anyone know anything about this antibody and what its presence in my blood means? Any insight or experience is greatly appreciated.
18429,I did not have any reaction from the shingles vaccine but I did from the pneumonia vaccine.
18430,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it in my thirties Started on my chin and ran up my forehead I still have scars inside my eyelid and cannot wear contacts anymore thankfully did not affect my vision I have not had it again I have several friends who have gotten the shingles vaccine recently and got shingles shortly thereafter though
18431,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: 94 millennial. I remember hearing about said parties but none of our parents did anything like this or even entertained the idea. I got vaccinated when I was younger
18435,Should i get shingrix at 22?: I got mine 2 weeks ago at 32 I have had shingles 3 times now.. only just went to my PCP about it and he said it would not of given it to me after my first break out.
18437,Mnires disease started the next day after getting Pfizer vaccine Covid: I have had Menieres for three decades shingles and Moderna Covid vaccines both irritated my ear symptoms. Still better than shingles for sure and Covid.
18440,On the streets of Winnipeg: I did not get the shingles vaccine but i did get the covid and flu shots. I died twice and got better
18443,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox at 7 over Christmas vacation so I must have gotten it at school. I also had Shingles at 37. Then I used a OMG do not make me go through this again letter to insurance and got the old Shingles vaccine at 53. Then I got the newest Shingles vaccine at 64.
18445,I Am miserable its on my face: I am not a doctor so take my advice for what it is worth. I believe what the eye doc may have meant is that it has not damaged your eye or the optic nerve. But it is clearly in your eye and should to be treated with meds. You can tell himher that some crazy nosy lady on Reddit told you this. But seriously with your eye blossoming like a rose you need meds to address this and give you some relief. Also not to alarm you but every time I get shingles on my eye I get styes afterwards. Do not know why it is not an advertised aftereffect but it has happened three times now. So do not be surprised if you get another gift from the shingles fairy. Good luck to you
18446,Shingles Sucks: No rash yet. Just the spasmodic pain every few seconds. It goes from above my left ear migrate to the ear lobe and now in the jawbone area.
18447,Post Herpetic Neuralgia from shingles at age 22 will it go away?: Oh man I Am sorry to hear that The diet helped me a lot. The antivirals did not do much for me pain wise it just stopped my rash from spreading further really. There was one day before I knew about the diet that I ate chicken teriyaki which had sesame oil in it. Apparently sesame has some of the highest mg of arginine which I did not know. The pain that followed almost sent me to the hospital it felt like a knife was lodged into my ribs. That Is when I found the diet and stuck to it It helped me a lot. I hope you feel some relief. I also supplemented with Lysine pills twice a day
18449,Absolutely I did not mean to insinuate one should not get the vaccine if my comment was interpreted that way. I recommend receiving all vaccines. I just think I personally had have an overload of the virus in my system which made me prone to having shingles twice.
18451,Antivirals making me feel like hot garbage: There are def known side effects of high dose valicyclovir but not sure about all the med interactions. You are pharmacist should know though and might be able to support. I feel pretty gross in general when I was on 3 gms a day but also had severe shingles... hope it heals quickly
18453,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: I am talking about the chicken pox vaccine.
18454,26F Still convinced this is dementia. Needing advice on my next steps.: TLDR Stop administering cognitive testing to yourself posting questions to dementia subreddits and catastrophising about this. You do not have dementia this is the result of your mental illness. Continue to seek treatment for health anxiety. What are the chances of it being dementia related? Essentially zero. This is a manifestation of your health anxiety. You should know asking these questions make your health anxiety worse not better so you should stop asking them. I need people to look at this from the perspective of what if it is not mental health related With all due respect you do not get to change the way we look at this just because you are anxious. This appears mental health related. I will go through some of your symptoms. Vertigo intense onesided face pain shooting optical nerve pain muscle weakness intense diaphragm pain Not dementia related Shingles Not dementia related The biggest thing that is worried me is the past few days... A certain amount of absentmindedness is normal. Walking into rooms and forgetting what you wanted to do in there. Looking for your glasses while your glasses are on your face etc.. It is embarrassing but normal. Mental illness would probably explain if you are a little more absentminded than normal. Struggling with words feeling the urge to repeat what I have said forgetting text conversations Can be depression ADHD. Slipping with words is normal Confusing dreams with reality Your description states you are aware it is a dream if you are fully awake. A little confusion as you are half asleep and half awake is normal Showingfeeling emotion for a split second then feeling it fade Depression Suddenly apatheticdepressednumb after symptoms worsened Depression anhedonia Feeling uncoordinated Likely subjective and not significant unless you are actively falling over or finding it is significantly impairing motor function Feeling like my sense of time is shot ADHD time blindness Hearing loss Do not know not at all related to dementia
18455,I almost lost 2 teeth to shingles.: I had internal shingles and it also brought me pain to my teeth jaw and face. Had no idea what was happening for months. Did all the tests MRI neurologist cardiologist scans the full work up. Still living with the nerve pain in my arm 4 months later. The rest slowly lessened. I also got my root canal tooth removed yesterday as there could be a connection. Look up toxic dental procedures. This is not something that goes away fast for many the PNP can last a year. Nerves take along time to heal apparently. Anti virals are great if you catch it in time. They prevent the PNP. I had no rash so did not get that opportunity. It will get better. Sounds like you are on the mend already. Pregablin is the only medicine that helped me and CBD cream.
18456,Vaccine Megathread: I gave birth to my second baby last month and had the RSV vaccine while pregnant. It has given me incredible peace of mind to know that this baby is protected my first was also born in RSV season but before the vaccine was available and we were so terrified by all the stories of our local hospitals overflowing with newborns and infants who needed breathing support. Plus I had RSV myself last year and despite being young and healthy it was absolutely awful. I Am happy to be vaccinated myself.
18463,Shingrix for 50yr olds: I would take it. Its better than getting shingles. I Am 64 and I just got shingles for the first time back in November. I had gotten a single dose. I just got the second shot. I do not want to get shingles ever again. Unfortunately a doctor said I would be dealing with this for the rest of your life. Also I Am still dealing with after effects. I have all these nerve endings on fire. I been taking Lyrica.
18470,33 year old female. I thought I could have WHIM Syndrome Warts hypogammaglobulinemia immunodeficiency myelokathexis but I do not have neutropenia. I have been immunocompromised since childhood and am looking for anyone who can help diagnose me. Viruses I got chicken pox Varicella Zoster Virus when I was 4 and got VERY sick. My siblings got it at the same time and only had a few spots. My mom said I had thousands and had to see a doctor. My dad got chicken pox twice the second time as an adult and almost died. When I was 11 I got shingles on my back. I got diagnosed with severe warts Human Papilloma Virus on my hands and feet when I was 12 numerous on every finger have not been able to get rid of them for over 20 years. I was vaccinated against Hepatitis B as scheduled but when my antibody titres came back it said my body did not respond to the vaccine and I would need to be vaccinated again. I had Rubella German Measles Virus despite being vaccinated against it. I always get the COVID and flu vaccines but still get them both whenever they circulate. I have had confirmed cases of Norovirus Norwalk on several occasions as well as numerous gastrointestinal viruses. ParasiticFungalBacterial Infections I contracted Ascaris lumbricoides a parasitic round worm infection after traveling in SE Asia. No other person in my group was infected as far as I know. I developed Clostridium Difficile after antibiotics in my 20s. Had numerous cases of athletes foot and a bacterial infection called pitted keratolysis to my feet. Developed impetigo as an adult as well. I have clubbing on several of my fingernails. I work in medicine am from a middle class family and my hygiene is great. So I really think my immune system is not fully functioning. Please someone help me
18473,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah so the vaccine came out when I was 4 the same year my brother was born. I know about the chickenpox parties but my parents never sent me to one. I guess I was just lucky to not get the chickenpox before the vaccine came out. Since my brother was constantly at the doctor getting his newborn shots in 95 96 mom had them give me the chickenpox vaccine too
18474,I made a post here a month ago when I first got the news.. Figured id post an update and spread some hope and positivity . Since my diagnosis i have gotten 23 Gardasil shots and have been on ImiquimodAldara for about 5 weeks now. I have noticed alot of improvement on the size of the warts since I have been being treated. So i am going to keep at it and hope they continue to get smaller in size until they are no longer there. I say this to hopefully share some hope that it will be okay  just take care of yourself the best you can. I should add i do not smoke or drink. I Am not sure how much that helps but i am sure it helps a little bit.
18475,"PSA: Vaccinated? Yes, you CAN still get shingles: My outbreaks have been worse and more frequent since getting the vaccine. Sorry you have had it again since getting the vaccine too :/"
18477,I had both series of shingles vaccine No Problem. But DIL Has Hashimotos and was told to get vaccine after 50. It is contraindicated for people whashimotos. She now has 2 new incurable auto immune conditions and is on permanent disability. If Auto immune be careful
18481,Shingles and other Vaccines: Yes it is worth it and I react to them because of an autoimmune disease ... I have seen a bad case of shingles on my husband's a 90 yr old aunt. Not sure how she survived. When we got our shingles vaccines the pharmacist said I am really pleased you are getting these. I had a neighbor commit suicide because he could not stand the pain of shingles. That is exactly what the man said. So .... vaccine to the max with every recommended vaccine there is Covid pneumonia shingles flu ....
18482,Shingles and other Vaccines: I had absolutely no side effects from the shingles vaccines. With the Covid vaccine and boosters I only had a sore arm for one day.
18483,Shingles shot reactions?: I had already had my first of two shots when I was diagnosed with MS. I got my second shot. And every other vaccine known to man.. before starting my DMT.
18486,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Damn. Was just telling my wife last night I need to really get my shingles vaccine I have been putting it off because I have read it causes one to not feeling well for a few days afterwards especially with the 2nd dose
18489,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I caught chickenpox as an adult four weeks ago. The hospital treating my mother for shingles was getting me to clean her woundsbegging me to come in at 200am and stop her wandering. I had been vaccinated according to my dad but since she would fallen into psychosis due to it and was sufferinglashing out aggressively we think my immune system crashed from the stress of dealing with it. It was the second worst experience of my life. It was that bad. My brain swelled and I hallucinated. I was in constant pain. I am still healing deep holes in my body. I will scar. Anyone who deliberately infects a baby with an easily preventable serious illness should never be spoken to again. Fuck them. I hate this MIL by proxy.
18498,As the title suggests. How do you prevent an outbreak ? If you ve had any experince with it plz share. My dad developped it 2 weeks ago it wraps around his left torso and now i have been noticing he s feeling itchy on the left side of his face nd it s red. I Am so scared for him coz he s alrdy suffering from the pain in his torso and other health issues. Can it develop on two areas just days weeks apart ? What can we do to prevent it from forming or at least make it less painful  widespread than the current one. I appreciate all of your answers.
18499,Shingles shot Ack: Sorry your doctor did not warn you. Yes side effects from that vaccination can be pretty severe. A friend warned me so I was slightly prepared. I felt like I had the worst flu of my life for several days. Felt just awful. I Have warned my younger friends since then too and they had similar reactions. Still better than getting shingles though And since no vaccine is 100 protective I guess we have to take a further step back and say hopefully its still better than getting an awful case of shingles. People whom I know who have had shingles had an absolute nightmare with it For anyone on here who has not had the shot yet try to schedule it at a time when you can take a few days off afterwards in case you end up feeling horrid. And then know that you will feel better soon.
18501,Do steroids help your pain?: I got pain relief from steroids but they also caused an outbreak of shingles. So that kind of defeated the purpose lol.
18504,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: Same here as I am only 41 they will not give it to me. I had shingles all near my eye and was so unbelievably painfulhad to see a specialist as it had reached my tear ductI was lucky no damage to eye. The pain was unreal I too would accept any side effects of vaccine
18505,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Jesus said Religion makes the word of God of non effect.
18508,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: No worries! I just think a lot of people think it's chicken pox redux, but it's not... it's dangerous and you should definitely not feel like you're being dramatic!"
18512,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I just had not gotten around to my shingles vaccine but then a friend in her 40s got a raging case of it that caused pain in her hip joint for months. I called my doc immediately after I heard that.
18513,Would you still get your kid vaccinated at the end of March for RSV?: Yes. do it Our little guy got it in daycare and thankfully it was not too bad. Hearing his breathing and lungs is something I do not ever want to hear again. He was miserable for weeks. Had to do breathing treatments at home and thankfully no ER or hospital visits.
18518,I Am in a new relationship. She does not want to get HPV. I disclosed to her before we became official. Also before we were intimate. She said she would go talk to her doctor about it to learn everything she can but has not yet. I Have told her the facts I know about it. I Have gotten all three gardasil shots. I only have two warts and have an appointment coming up soon to get them frozen off. I Have talked to a few different doctors about it and none of them make a big deal about it. One even told me with how common it is that I did not have to disclose. Which of course I did not agree with. Any advice on what I can do to help put her at ease with the fact I have low risk HPV?
18522,7 Tips for Shingles Dr. Janine: I got Shingles on my elbow with lesions covering about an 8 inch patch. The Dr. Gave me some meds and said it would run its course in about 3 to 5 weeks. I was in so much pain I applied Ivermax an anti parasitic anti viral in less than 30 minutes the pain stopped. In 6 hours the lesions had shrunk by about 13. I took 3 doses a day for 3 days...by day 4 it was completely healed. I buy Ivermectin from the farm supply store. I dose my dogs once a month to prevent heartworm and parasites. It takes a syringe to extract it from the bottle. It is dosed by body weight. Later in the year I got covid. The Ivermectin helped heal in a few days. IVERMEC BRAND Ivermectin 1 solution
18523,Questions about getting vaccinated: Hmmm. So I would rather not have covid the flu measles RSV mumps shingles polio rubella meningitis tetanus etc. I get a flu vaccine every year and lately a covid one as well. Due for RSV and shingles. I actually had shingles when I was like 42 and it was not fun but it gets worse the older you are so I hear. Vaccines are safe and effective as has been proven for many years. I used to work with a guy who had polio as a kid his limp was very pronounced. He was around my age too. Parents just were too lazyuneducated to get him vaccinated. A lot of young people today have not experienced real life before vaccines and they are quick to blame them for everything from autism disproven a thousand times over and the disease du jour. A lot of them believe in FacebookTik Tok science instead of trusting actual medical professionals. Many of them are conspiracy theorists. If you lack critical thinking skills it is easy to get sucked into social media medicine.
18524,RIDICULOUS MASK MANDATES RETURN across the United States: I had Covid 19 I had the shits soreness in the throat dehydration loss of appetite and lost 20 pounds lasted for 2 months that was no accident it was done on purpose to destroy the Economy about the rich getting richer all about control money power wealth world domination and genocide right along with depopulation
18525,Shingles: I got my first case of shingles around a year ago right after coming out of a flare across the back of my thigh and up my asscheek. At this point i am wondering if god is trying to tell me something
18532,40 yr old female diagnosed with sero negative RA about a year ago. I had shingles in March while on methotrexate and Humira. Took over a month to clear up during which time I went off those meds. Now I Am on methotrexate and Rinvoq and I Am having recurrent shingleslike sores on my scalp. This started more than a month ago about three months after the first shingles cleared up. At first I was sure it was shingles again because of the unique way it hurts and itches and is so tender so intensely like its in the nerves. But its different in two major ways its all over the scalp in various locations not isolated to a specific side like shingles is supposed to be and its not following the life cycle of shingles instead they seem to pop up in different locations every day more like insect bites than a real rash that develops from flat to raised to blisters etc. They are unbearable. Has anyone had anything similar? I Am afraid it might be lupus or some other new issue cropping up. Do Not want to lose my hair
18534,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Dude I ran and got the shot and then ran again when the better double shot came out. Mom and her Dad got them figure I was bound to be cursed.
18537,Hi Reddit I Am 18 female 190lbs black and I posted a couple days ago about my arm. After dubiously googling I Have diagnosed myself with shingles. Now there are a couple of things that could be wrong with this. A I Am so young like you would think Id still have my immunity because I am vaccinated against chicken pox. B They do not present as shingles would on other black people I Have seen with shingles a lot redder less fluidfilled looking C this one i do not know about but there are small brown dots at the center of these bumpsthey are barely visible and not present on all of the bumps D They do not hurt however none have popped and I Have occasionally scratched one on my hand by accident and that was EXTREMELY painful Timeline first bump I saw on July 19th was in my right hand every day more clusters of bumps sprout up only on my right arm my arm has grown very tingly as the days progress Priors I Am on duloxetine for depression I have anxiety I was on antibiotics before the bumps started for an ear infection. I did not finish the round of antibiotics oopsies as of today my white blood cell count is normal so no infection I have a round of steroid pills that I could take should I? Picture below ok bye thank you.
18538,"Anyone having repeated attacks of shingles get the shingles vaccine?: Because my immune system is in constant overdrive, I've had shingles several times in the last 2 years. My doctor and I discussed the shingles vaccine but are both worried it could trigger another attack, possibly more severe than I've had already, since it's made of live virus. Even if it were for the pain alone, I'd hope to never experience shingles again, but it's also embarrassing to have a blistery rash across my face (though I had it on my torso as well) and every time I have to avoid contact with most of my family who are grown but have never had chicken pox and even avoid contact with our 5 children who have been vaccinated for chicken pox but their pediatrician says they can still get it from me (it would just hopefully be milder and shorter lived). Has anyone who experienced a repeat attack had the vaccine and did it cause any complications??"
18543,Should have gotten RSV Vaccine: Not OP but I got the RSV vaccine at 60. I had RSV prior it was gruesome I told the pharmacist I had lupus which they should know from my meds. He put it in to the insurance company CareFirst and it was covered. My doc told me I should get another shot next year. I will pay if I have to. I was down for weeks with RSV
18547,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Shin gri x kicked my as s far more than the C covid vaccine I highly recommend all of it I got my flu shot earlier this fall and my son came down with the flu just before Christmas. I took care of him at my place while he recovered and I did not catch it. Vaccines are awesome even if they beat us up a bit first.
18549,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Yeah my MIL lost all her hearing in her right ear because of shingles
18553,Shingles shot Ack: I had no issues after being warned it would knock me on my ass. Vaccines affect everyone differently.
18556,I recently was diagnosed with shingles.first pic is how it started It progressively got worse over time even on aciclovir. It got to the point of going to a different doctor to get another opinion. But 2 doctors same diagnosis. The second doctor commented one of the worse cases she has seen. It has gone down a considerable amount now. I still will randomly deal with nerve pain. Almost like I slept wrong and my neck will start hurting but will happen midday. Any tips to prevent a flare up in the future. Probably one of the worse pains I have ever gone through.
18558,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Both times gave me chills at night and overnight like Id never had in my life. My teeth were chattering one of the times even. Both times were somewhat rough for my wife too. But were both strong believers in vaccines and we would both get both shingle shots again if we had to without hesitation.
18563,I had no problem w either shingles shot which is strange because I react to all of them.
18566,33 weeks pregnant with shingles: Ugh - that is a lot. Yes to chiro - he helped me a lot with gentle movement. I could not sleep with anything touching my hip (had in about the same place). Oatmeal baths and benedryl helped.
18567,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: 1972 here. Had shingles when I was 12 and just got my first vaccine shot 6 mos ago. Meanwhile I had a pilot friend who was late30s who got shingles in the eye. Ended her Canadian flying career.
18569,Shingles  Brain Shocks  not looking for diagnosis  just asking if anyones seen or heard about it: I had shingles on my scalp. First symptoms felt like worms under my skin crawling around then I got blisters and everything sensitive. And then I got electricity shooting through my brain like 68 times a day. Yes it is debilitating you really have to stop everything and just choose your eyes and brave yourself. Mine lasted like 3 months. It eventually went from 23 times a day to once a day once a week then it just stopped. My scalp is still numb and I am super paranoid everytime I feel a tingle there
18570,Shingles vaccine: My wife had it on the right side of her face and right eye. She still takes a maintenance dose of antivirals and is still seeing an ophthalmologist regularly. Go with the vaccine.
18571,Side effects from radiation: That sounds incredibly painful. Was the DCis is right below the nipple? I am wondering if the nerve grew back and is somehow unhappy. There may be a pain specialist that could help you?
18575,I got the shingles vaccine and warning the side effects are severe.: Did your back hurt? My back is killing me
18576,Shingles Sucks: The actual shingles. I got the vaccine the minute I turned 50.
18577,2nd shot was worse for me but well worth it to not get shingles
18582,What happens if you get sick: Here an overview from The Mayo Clinic . about the shingles vaccine side effects. I actually got my first shingles jab I have to get a booster in April a few days before you did. I have been on Plaquinel as well as a biologic for over 10 years so my immune system is pretty knackered too. I had a lot of side effects listed but what you are describing is different from both the info about official side effects and my own understanding and personal experience. Sorry for the terrible sentence but imho not a medical professional you should absolutely get seen sooner than later. You might be experiencing a different type of side effect or it is logical to consider you picked up a virus whilst getting the vaccine. Either way knowledge is power Maybe you can take someone to help with communication? If not write out what you need to communicate meds infection shingles vaccine date symptoms should do it to ensure they have a clear understanding of your situation. I am sorry you are feeling so awful. Keep us posted? purpleheart
18583,"13 year old F with Shingles: STORY TIME. Yo, I'm 24 now but thought I share this. My parents say I've never had chicken pox and I got the vaccine. They think I got shingles from the vaccine even though I got the vaccine as a baby. When I got shingles at 13 I had tests that week and cheer tryouts for the high school team so I was very stressed. The doc thinks the stress caused the shingles. The blisters were where a braw would be. I still have some slight scars/hyperpigmentation. I'm an EMT and getting my RN in Jan 2024 so I have some knowledge lol. I like to share this rarity and wondering if I can I get shingles again? I try to manage my stress because I'm scared shingles will come back"
18584,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Having had shingles had chickenpox long before the vaccine existed and watching my husband deal with postherpetic neuralgia pain for twenty years after he had shingles ditto Id say MIL getting them is richly deserved and I hope she enjoys them. I Have never been that sick in my adult life. I could not get up off the bed I was so dizzy. I hope OP is far away from these whackjobs both physically and literally.
18589,Happened to an elderly family member of ours... she went to her Dr he told her she needed a shingles shot that evening rushed to hospital and 3 days later she was dead .
18592,Tell me about your vaccine flares: I need to get the shingles but I Am dreading how bad people say it is. My sil has normal immune system and shingles vaccine knocked her for three days. But I know getting actual shingles would be worse. Hope you feel better soon
18595,Hey guys I had a pretty gnarly case of shingles 5 years ago. I had post shingles nerve pain for almost 6 months and suffered terribly. I m getting over C covid now and the pain is back. No rash yet but the rash was after the pain the first time. I ve also been vaccinated for Shingles since my first infection. I turned 50 after the first time so was eligible. Am I in for another terrible run? Is there anything I can do to prevent it? I took antivirals the first time but it didn t really change my experience.
18596,Shingles Is NO Joke: I have gotten the original 2 shot vaccine then the single dose. I have gotten shingles 2 times after vaccination...but my rashes were non painful went away in a week or so. Getting vaccinated reduces getting shingles and if you DO get them they are not as bad as full blows shingles.
18597,Rinvoq and Shingles: 39yo F Started Rinvoq earlier this year and got shingles in August. I was in the middle of a flare too and it totally sucked The pain was not as bad as my RA pain but I felt like I had turrets syndrome with itching the nerve pain. Antivirals cleared it up and they gave me gabapentin so I could sleep through the nerve pain. I have been fine since then besides my kids keeping me sick with public viruses
18600,My mom was doing the same she even got a tetanus shot just to be a bad ass. Something finally snapped and now she is admitting vaccine injury intercostal neurologia a symptom of shingles. She now goes to pain clinics.
18604,Shingles vaccine: People always used to tell me how bad shingles was. I thought 'yeah right'....until I got it. Six weeks of feeling like I had been lit on fire. Have never felt pain like it. I got the vaccine as soon as I could afford it.
18608,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: A friend of mine got it on her 50th birthday and has Bells palsy from it. I got it as soon as possible after seeing what she went through

Heart flutters have been noted on harness monitor but cardio only found 'a small leak' when ultrasound. I am most definitely not going back to that cardio due to his insistence that any issue was weight related despite me having lost well over 100 pounds from my heaviest when I met him. I have had constant fatigue going back to at least before 2020. I want to say even before 2019 but I cannot quite remember. No matter how much sleep I get at a time I will be very tired within 2 hours and my naps can range from 26 hours. I feel no sense of 'rested' constantly have mind fog despite my thoughts racing a million miles an hour. I can not will myself to do many tasks including simply sitting down any reading when this tired feeling is present. I feel very selfconscious about my lack of ability to do things as this does not feel like something a NORMALhealthy 38 adult should be going through. My 69 year old mother has more energy than me usually on far less sleep. I rarely feel a sense of hunger though that is something I have noticed most if not all of my life. I consume possibly larger amounts of liquid than most people. Two 2liters to a gallon a day at best guess. I do not drink things that are sugared but I do consume a lot of caffeine. Diet Pepsi and Coke Zero. I have gone off caffeine for a few days at a time and it does not seem to effect my tiredness in a positive way. I have an app that I use to help remember to take my meds but because I can not take my vitamins within two hours of my calcium I have a habit of forget one or the other. However the calcium started post Gastric Bypass 2023. My most recent labs were in Oct if anyone wants to ask what a certain thing is at what level. I am not sure what info is immediately needed for this post. The 30mgs of Adderall XR initially helped quite a bit but no longer as I am back to feeling like I need sleep within two hours of just about any wakefulness. I am able to stay away for longer stretches night. Behold I am a vampire but that does not help me in doing public errands or payable work. On a separate but likely related note I have no 'oomph' to do most of my hobbies particularly writing which I very much love and wish to get back to. Ideas form in daydreams but they do not move from mind to fingers to computer. On a separate note at the beginning of Nov 2024 I made the mistake of taking too much Delta 9 in the form of two gummy rings. This lead to disorientation movement nausea movement pain time distortion hallucinations and a trip to the hospital. Following that certain news and a few other things sent me into what I would call a monthlong panic attack. It has only stopped lessened seems the better description due to taking my dentist appointment medication and some organic thc smoke. Due to the effectiveness of the organic smoke I will be asking my GP about medical cannabis when I next see him Dec 30th Please ask me anything or give me ideas of what might be options for me to check on also please excuse spelling errors. I have some reading and writing difficulties but was unsure if they should be noted with my other issues.
18612,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: Me too girl me too I cannot even tell you. Truly disappointing. I pride myself on being healthy I eat very well and take care of my skinbody. When I tell you I was super healthy going I to academy I was But in academy you become nutrient deficient with less than 5 minutes to eat your meals. Dehydrated. And sleep about 5 hours a night if you are lucky It is all very unhealthy for the body and my body was maxed out. I thought I was holding myself together very well mentally especially... but it is gogogo there and they PT the shit out of you I can handle that but I am also 36 years old and not exactly a spring chicken like the rest of my class in their earlymid twenties. My body wanting to handle it is a different story. I do not think I will be going back going to apply for a different position within State Police as this was my second attempt at academy. First time around I got injured within the first week of academy last November. I was definitely more physically conditioned this time around no shin splints or knee pain and we run lots of hills so this was very disappointing for me... but I take it as a sign that it is not the direction I am supposed to go with all this. Another door opened for me and I am going to pursue that instead. I will not be a Trooper but I will still be working for State Police. But as you were saying it made me very angry too Like I always feel like the worst of situations happen to me ... Where did you get your Shingles?
18614,Everyone I know who had the shingles vaccine has a rough day. Everyone I know who had shingles had a rough to miserable month and I know of two people who were hospitalized with shingles. I know what I would choose.
18615,So I Have caught shingles. On my face and in my eye. Symptoms started 11 days ago. First it felt like eye irritation dryness and strain. Then it felt more like a sinus issue I fought through it until Thursday when I awoke with the rash forming on my forehead Doctor diagnosed as shingles on Friday and I Am now taking an anti viral eye drops and ear drops with Advil for the pain every 46 hours. They had an optometrist check my eye and I Am told nothing to worry about there Since the diagnosis I Am covered from my cheek up into my scalp with the largest pustules around my eye The pain is about a 46 except in my ear that is giving me a constant shot of 10 plus every few seconds Not sure what I Am looking for here maybe just some idea of what to expect as the virus progresses
18618,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I brought home chicken pox from school and my mom did her own chicken pox party she made me and my sister take baths together and sleep in the same bed so that my sister would get it too. She got a case that was so bad she had pox on the bottoms of her feet and in her throat. She got a really bad case of it and she actually had a flare of shingles a few years later she was like 10 or 11. I hope my mom is enjoying her karma. I would not know I no longer speak to her.
18619,RSV Vaccine???? because: In Ontario and same. My doctor's office called me last week. My 4 month got it today on the same day as his routine vaccines and if he did not already have this appt they were booking just RSV for this week anyways.
18621,Rsv shot 3rd trimester: Yes super common. My OB only offers it after week 32. They told me my body would pass on the antibodies to the baby for the remaining weeks of pregnancy and if I decide to breastfeed baby would continue to receive them via milk. Sore arm was my only side effect that left in a few hours. If you want to get it and its offered through your provider Id get it In my area a lot of people want it so its constantly going out of stock at offices. My OB gave me a fact sheet at week 30 and told me that at week 32 if I wanted it and if they had it in stock I should get it since the availability of them are inconsistent.
18622,Sorry this I am adding demographic info to my original post because my original post was deleted. Original post is below the demo info. Age Mid 50s Sex Male Height 5'7 Weight 185lb Allergies Seasonal but very mild Not allergic to any med and currently not on any meds. Have not been on any prescription meds in years. Last prescription was for antibiotics 2 years ago for sinus infection. Only take OTC pain relief meds as needed. Might be Aspirin Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen. Tobacco user. Original post Let me start by saying as a child I am in my mid 50s now I have never had the chicken pox. If I did I was not symptomatic. I say this because both my younger siblings had it together I did not. In fact my mother tried to make sure I caught it but I never had any symptoms. This made me think I just never had it. Now I am just thinking I was asymptomatic. Fast forward to now.. About a week ago I had some dull aching pain where my appendix was. Although it was more toward the surface was as a bit scared I might be having an issue with my appendix. Called a few friends that had appendicitis in the past and was told my pain was too mild. Well they were right the next morning pain started going away but the skin on the front of my upper thigh was sensitive. It was almost like it was sunburned but a bit numb tingling pain and itching all at the same time. Sometimes it felt like the way the skin on my cheeks felt after getting some teeth filled with the novocain wearing off. For the last week that sensation of pain numbness and itching and some muscle ache traveld on my right side from the front of my thigh the side and my back up to the bottom of my rib cage. All on my right side. I do not have any rash or blistering and it is been a week now. I would like to go see a MD and get something prescribed but was told it might be hard to diagnose without a rash. I guess my questions is can I take something to help with this even before a rash? I am really thinking I have got the shingles and at this point tempted to ask my MD for an antiviral to possibly to put a stop to this before it gets worse. Are there any OTC meds? BY THE WAY at one point yesterday my lower back on my right side only was so itchy I took a temp gun and my skin was showing 5 degrees hotter than my left side.. I know it is not accurate but I felt like I had to do something. With that I took a benadryl. Within about 30 mins my skin had cooled down. Still itchy painful numb and what not but was not like it was also sunburned.
18623,Hello my girlfriend24F has shingles..for the 5th time THIS year and 9th time overall. Her shingles come inside of her thigh on her left leg. She stated that she feels tired and thingy on her left leg on the day it starts to blister. She does not feel sick or anything similar in a dramatic way it usually just blisters for few weeks then she is back to normal after some steroid shots and a round of oral medication. She works in medical field she started to frequently exercise last year because I told her to strengthen her immune system by exercising. Her diet is very moderate she eats healthy typically unless we go out to eat together. Id say she did grow up with a sedimentary lifestyle until we started to date and became somewhat physically active. I mean I see people getting shingles 2 times in their lifespan maybe 3 but 9 times? Is this normal? Is anyone in the same situation? Also she tests every year for herpes every year and its negative every year.
18627,Shingles vaccine: You know what is worse than feeling sick after a vaccine jab getting fucking Shingles. My neighbor is a boomer vaccine skeptic type whose left side of his face is now paralyzed due to fucking shingles. Get the two step job. Do Not be all Raw milk RFK about this.
18628,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Lol...I remember lining up with sleeves rolled up in the Air Force, medical personnel had immunization guns and you went from station to station depending on what you ""needed"". Surprised I didn't grow a third arm"
18629,I work with a guy who got shingles the next day after taking the shot. His doctor would NOT note it as a side effect.
18630,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I will not be 50 for another year. I had four little blisters on my face. Thought it was bug bites.
18632,America39s Lost What Little Respect It Held With the World Over This Decrepit Coot: I got shingles in my fifties. I really lucked out because I realized what it was by the tingling. Got the antiviral meds immediately and did not even loose time at work. I would never take another jab but including flu shot after this mess
18633,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles when I was 18. It sucked It infected my optic nerve and I had to be in the hospital for 1 week and squirt antiviral goop into my eye for like a month. I was over the worst of it pretty quickly but I had postherpetic neuralgia pain headaches fatigue for a couple months afterwards. I also ended up with an awful scar on the end of my nose that took a few years to fade completely.
18635,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I got it at like 30 and my mom had it at like 75... Mine sucked  on my face  hers was debilitating on her back
18636,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah my mom took me to one but I was already kind of old 10 so I was affected so badly I was almost hospitalized. I Am still salty.
18637,We had a doctor apt today and the dr recommended getting the RSV vaccine since today was the last day my child would be eligible 8 months today. He just had RSV two weeks ago but the dr said he was still ok to get it and it would just provide more antibodies. Now I Am stressing out that I made the wrong decision and should not have let him get it. Does anyone know anything about this? Will he be okay?
18638,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: You can get some at CVS Walgreens Walmart maybenot totally sure Publix and you can contact your local health department about getting up to date.
18642,Fortunately my cases are usually mild compared to what I read on here. I mostly get itchy and painful bumps at the top of the crack of my butt but it does make sitting pretty uncomfortable I had a fever for a few days this week which was probably linked to this new outbreak. Normally before an outbreak I get a feeling somewhere else on my body like someone has rubbed sandpaper over it but I didn t notice anything like that this time. Anyone had shingles despite being vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated? Did it shorten the virus? Unfortunately I live in Norway and it s hard to get antiviral treatment
18643,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Hurts more than gout and gout made me cry
18644,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got it the day before my 50th. Holy hell just having to wear a winter coat was like having a sandpaper shirt with no skin on.
18646,Second shingles shot done. I will report back tomorrow on how shitty I feel.
18647,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: I had it on my face when I was 41. I am due for my second dose of the vaccine but I Have read horror stories about people who had the second shot. I might wait until after February.
18649,Shingles shot Ack: I should add that I never had chicken pox only one round of the varicella shot so this may be one of the reasons it hit me hard
18650,"So I finally got my second dose of the meningitis vaccine and wow, what a difference from the first one. The first shot was nothing compared to this one that left me feeling like I got hit by a truck. I heard it could be rough, but I didn't think it would be this bad. Still, I'd take a day of feeling under the weather over the potential complications of meningitis any day. Stay safe, get vaccinated!"
18651,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Use cold packs to help you not scratch I had it a few years ago along my left lower back. The cold packs helped to calm the shingles down  allowed me to sleep.
18652,"Is the Shingles vaccine helpful?: It seems like there is something particular about your physiology that makes you prone to recurrent bouts of Shingles. So, I wouldn't assume everyone else would have the same experience. The research shows that the vaccine is effective at preventing a recurrence for most people. There are exceptions of course as your experience shows."
18654,Exactly the same situation with me. The second shingles vaccine received had nowhere near the same reaction.
18656,Is this my life now?: I Am dealing w PHN right now. I Am only in my 5th week but I Am pretty sure this is going to be my new normal. Did you ever get the shingles vaccine? I did not but my pcp has recommended that once I Am over this bout that I should get it. I too have been out of work for 4 weeks. My shingles was on my right arm starting at the neck and spine all the way to my hand. I basically have limited use of my right handarm. I Am scheduled to see pain management in a month.
18659,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: And do it before your wknd. I never get reactions to vaccines but the shingles vaccine is pretty rough for some reason and you need 2 shots
18662,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: I have had both twice. A bad case of shingles is about as excruciating as any pain I had with cancer including bone pain. Screaming in agony nothing can be done outside of some opiates and time. Both with cancer and shingles.
18663,Day after 2nd shingles dose no problems age 50 bodyweight 165: I had shingles in my left shoulder in 2nd grade and it was absolutely crippling while it lasted. My left shoulder and arm is still slightly smaller and weaker than my right 20 years later. I Am also left handed.
18671,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: Never had any of the side effects or crappiness after 1st or 2nd shot.
18672,I know a number of people who got shingles after getting Covid Vaccine. Previously I never knew anyone who had gotten Shingles. Stick your Shingles shot up your dot.
18673,Terrified of getting Shingrix shingles vaccine shot. Experiences? Thoughts?: I am sorry you had a rough time with your first shot. What were your side effects? Any uptick in your dysautonomia symptoms? P.S. Love your avatar. The red and black is very striking in dark mode
18674,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: yeah latinos usually do have a great sense of humour
18680,Shingles shot: I felt crummy. Id advise to get it on a Friday when you do not have any significant commitments at the weekend. Then he can rest if needed.
18682,I Am almost 36 weeks so I went to get the RSV vaccine that is supposed to protect mom and baby from RSV. Well the following day I get a call from my doctor and was told I got the wrong vaccination. The technician accidentally gave me the AREXVY RSV shot which is only for older adults 50 not approved by the CDC for pregnant women or women in my age group. I was told there is a risk in pregnant woman for premature birth and low birth weight. Luckily because I Am so far into my pregnancy I Am not overly concerned with that but I Am just really pissed at the negligence. Not to mention one animal study found worsening respiratoryRSV symptoms in pediatric samples of two and under so now I have to worry about what that might mean for my baby. I was told by my doctor that this has happened a few times before with the vaccines being so new and having similar names  AREXVY older adult and Abrysvo for pregnancy. Even though the doctor tried to put me at ease at the end of the day because the vaccine is so new and its not meant for our population it will constantly be in the back of my mind as to how it might affect me or my baby now or in the near future. I Am not trying to be dramatic but my point is make sure you triple check with the person administering your vaccine that they are giving you the right one. i am grateful at least that they have an RSV vaccine for newborns.
18684,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: I wish we could get it sooner than 50. I have already had shingles completely destroy the nerves in the left side of my face. I did not even have that bad of a case clinically Just one sore on my mouth was it. Ended up with a bad case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Left side of my face was paralyzed for months still way weaker lost taste and smell could not hear out of my left year. it is been 8 yrs. Saw a neurologist and he said if it is not better now then it probably is what it is until I die. Weaker left side still harder to hear in my left ear some times my face feels like it is on fire and ants are crawling all over it. Herpetic nerve pain is no joke. For the record with the vaccinations being commonplace I have heard that our generation should expect more frequent cases of shingles than previous. Personally I am ok with the sacrifice to know our kids will not have to go through what I did.
18685,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: Sore and swollen for 34 days bruising stuck around about a week. Been a couple weeks now and it still itches occasionally.
18691,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Is it typically topical to the site of the injection or just on a random spot on the body? It stings and burns at about a 510 but does not itch.
18693,Shingles vaccine: Felt like someone took a bat to my arm. Good luck.
18694,just to address this as i am aware its a very American heavy sub in the UK its not part of your routine schedule but you can purchase the vaccinations for around 150 provided they have not had it before which was my plan and i was very set on doing Anyway toddler has been very fussy and upset the last few days barely sleeping or eating but switches between being as happy as anything to miserable within minutes which as a sahm i have been dealing with alone. we were out in the garden for a while a few days ago and after i noticed he came up with a rash but toddler has a few allergies and there is ants out the back so saw a doctor to double check but put it down to hayfever and ant bites. finally its the weekend so plans are made to take him to a farm for the first time with partner and my mum. it takes so long getting ready that its almost nap time when we are leaving but partner and my mum want to push on through and decide toddler will stay awake shocking to no one with brains toddler fell asleep by the time we got there. cue partner being rude and angry because i do not want to wake him up id rather we take him back home have him get a good rest and try again later and then my mum chimes in must be hard with chickenpox WHAT she then goes on to say he definitely has chickenpox clear as day and hence why he is so tired. like first of why not fucking tell me if you clocked it BEFORE WE WENT OUT IN PUBLIC? thank god we were in the car the whole time but she was fully going to have us walk around a farm while my toddler is cosplaying a very cute plague rat if he does have chicken pox its at that stage before it blisters but i am just devastated i really wanted to get him the vaccine he already has allergies and skin problems i did not want him to deal with this too i had chicken pox 4 times as a child and it sucked massively i would hate for him to have to have it even once. but now both partner and mum are annoyed with me because i said we are not taking him to a farm when he is like this. i desperately hope that its not chicken pox i took him to the doctor literally yesterday and they did not say anything but there are more marks than yesterday that look a bit blistery yes i am in denial its just so disheartening that all they care about are the plans we had while i am sat here in tears because my toddler feels so sick probably really uncomfortable and will now have this shit dormant in him for the rest of his life ready to appear as shingles which coincidentally my beloved grandma is currently at home suffering with despite having had the shingles vaccination. i do not want my baby to suffer even a little bit i really wish i had just taken out a credit card to get him this vaccine back in February
18698,Shingles vaccine: I had already planned to get mine this fall and had to push it back twice but I do not want to push it back anymore so I can get my second before things change too much. I heard someone was thinking of banning vaccines. I no longer think that will happen but one never knows so I am also thinking of updating my DPT as it had been 10 years. Between two shingles shots Covid the flu and that I feel like I am going to be sick every darn weekend of the winter. Good thing I hate winter so I will not be missing out on much other than feeling good.
18699,I got shingles from chicken pox vaccine. Personally I did not get covid vaccine I do not know if it could because it I would not be surprised
18701,Shingles Vaccine: It had me out for 3 or so days. My numbers were a bit higher than normal but that is expected for any vaccine. But totally worth it. I had a few friends who ended up with shingles near the beginning of COVID. One ended up with a line of infection right where her mask went. All were supremely miserable.
18706,28 Male no known health issues not currently taking any medicine. At the beginning of the month I tested positive for COVID and had a relatively minor bout with it as far as I know it was my first infection and Id been vaccinated and boosted twice. About a week and half or so ago I started having sinus issues that progressed to post nasal drip and later cobble stone throat the last two are what I am currently suffering from and it tends vary in severity throughout the day. For the last few days I have been monitoring my temperature which hovers around 99.698.8 which is not necessarily concerning but seems to indicate a low grade fever. My symptoms have not seen a significant change over the last few days so I am assuming its nothing that serious but curious if I might be suffering from some kind of cold or could COVID still be lingering this far on? I have thought about testing myself again but I have gathered that testing positive a few weeks after is fairly common and not necessarily an indicator or anything I am just wondering if I have been unusually unlucky and caught a cold flu or even the RSV which I hear I going around.
18709,2 Incidentally one cannot help wondering if this under consideration by NACI in context of recent changes to the following product monograph is because of increased prevalence of Shingles since COVID. I also got Shingles during LongCOVID was advised to get vaccinated.
18712,How many of us have had shingles 5 10 15 or more times? At what age was your first outbreak?: I had it once in 2013. This year I had a stroke and did not have.the outbreak bu It am having the nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia.
18713,I had the double dose shingles vaccine. I was a basket case for two days each time. But my husband had shingles before he could get the vaccine. Let me promise you the two day basket case is nothing compared to getting the real thing.
18716,Hi I Am day 6 from date of shingles rash appearance. I Have been on 3x1000mg daily of ValtrexI think its the generic since the 2nd day of the appearance. I guess the Valtrex is helping or this was a mild case because I have not really had any adverse symptoms like pain excessive itching. Just the rash that feels like a sunburn random pains on my right side and arm and an overwhelming sense of feeling gross all over like fever and body aches. Easily controlled with just Tylenol. So far so good Anyways I Have been experiencing a crazy brain fog confusion shortly after taking my Valtrex dose. It lasts a few hours and seems to be getting more intense as I progress through the 7 day prescription. Its got to the point where I really do not want to go through that again. Anyone else get this? Do Not worry I will finish the entire course but man its getting crazy
18717,ITS NOT MONKEY POX Its shingles from Covid 19 vaccine Another cover up from vaccine side effects
18720,First dose awful side effects: Mine gave me terrible side effects for like 45 days and then resolved completely. Hang in there
18725,My genital warts are becoming lighter kind of fading in color and the skin around is drying as that happens. Casual not intense itching too. They seem to be disappearing. I took Gardasil first dose a month ago and I work out actively and take supplements too. Could this be a positive affect? Not sure if I should leave it or see a doctor AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Any help?
18728,"Minoxidil (Rogaine) 2 weeks in, side-effects/allergic reaction?: tl;dr, I think MAYBE I'm having an allergic reaction to something. Possibly the Rogaine. I've almost been on it for two weeks. If I stop taking it now (or at least two days, assuming my Doctor's appointment on Wednesday tells me it's not the Rogaine) what's the worst that can happen to me? Am I going to screw up the hair regrowth and start back at square one, am I going to hit the shedding period (hasn't happened yet) and look even worse than before for the foreseeable future??? I mean, ideally, I'd like to not die, so I guess the alternative is always better than to keep doing something despite allergies, but... it'd be nice to know what I'm in for. Too Long Part/Backstory: I'm obviously going to a doctor (there's an appointment for me on Wednesday.) My skin has hurt around the right side of my body/chest/side. It's happened before for a day or two but stopped, always assumed it was just like... I slept weird or something. I dunno, bodies are weird. However, after starting Rogaine almost 2 weeks ago it happened again, thought the same as above. But then on Saturday morning (I think?) little bumps/blisters appeared. Looked like contact dermatitis. Now, before anyone says anything, I wash my hands with soap & water after every application of Rogaine. I have no outbreaks in or around where I rub it or my hands. So, flash forward to today, and now I've got some bumps/blisters forming in a similar spot on my back. My right armpit hurts (lymphnode?) and I have a bit of chest pain and in general my body feels achey. Literally all that has changed in my life is basically using a hand mirror and taking Rogaine. I haven't left my house in weeks. UPDATE: LOL, I was stressing so hard about hairloss I got myself a case of the SHINGLES! FML! T_T"
18731,Shingles vaccine: I got it right when Covid started. There apparently was some belief at that time that it could provide some protection against Covid. I just did not want to risk getting shingles since I had a bad case of chickenpox as a child. I think my arm hurt a lot. Have Not gotten shingles.
18732,34F first time here. Dr told me she had never seen something manifest here but she is confident it is shingles. Waiting on cultures to come back.: I have it on shoulder blade upper bicep and inside arm. 2 deliveries no meds of babies and this is close 2nd on nerve pain in my left arm for 3 weeks. Also said it was not usual presentation. I am sorry. I hope it gets better soon.
18734,Shingrix for 50yr olds: I just got my Shingrix vaccine in early April and I am 40. I have had shingles three times since I was 28. My doctor called my insurance company ahead of time and did a prior authorization for it. They deemed it medically necessary since I have had shingles a few times before. The last time was pretty bad and I kept bugging them for antivirals as it was not improving. I am sure it was partially a squeaky wheel gets the grease situation but so what? I wanted the vaccine and I got it. I get my second dose in July. Super relieved to know that I will not have to deal with it again... hopefully for a long time. I am not sure if I will need a vaccine booster in 25 years or something but I will gladly get it as shingles is terrible.
18738,I will let you know but I have not had major reactions to past covid vaccines or the combination of covid and flu vaccines. My only bad reaction lately was for the shingles vaccine
18739,Glad I got it all done but I am huuung over from a 3shot cocktail yesterday Covid booster Flu shot and Shingles vaccine another surprise You better do this or else for those turning 50.
18740,Shingles vaccine: I had the shingles for the 1st only time 2 years ago. Mine wrapped from middle if my chest around to the middle of my back the only way I can describe the pain is someone jamming a snapped stick into a steam burn while having a heart attack.... The vaccine could not be worse than that.
18741,Just diagnosed today: Hey. This might not be what you want to hear I got shingles in January this year and believed it to be a complete mystery. 34 years old and pretty healthy took lots of exercise. Despite having heaps of loss and trauma over those past 2 years I lost my mum my childhood dog my grandma was dying worked in middle management mentally I still felt fine. I enjoyed holidays parties laughed a lot etc Oh also I had bouts of crippling health anxiety thinking I had cancer so we also have that in common. My body was obviously holding all that stress and tension whilst I wore mental resilience as a badge of honour. But actually you are probably stressed to your limits. Do Not learn the hard way like me. I Am currently in the midst of a nervous breakdown. Off work constant panic attacks unable to function. It was triggered by something stupid I did last week but its clearly been building for years months. Shingles is the warning sign that you likely are actually stressed. get yourself some help to actually deal with the stress you are under and the health anxiety you are feeling. Hope your shingles clears up quickly x
18742,They are out of their corrupt craniums. We get sick or die these cats get richer? No thanks to any jab. My neighbor got a shingles vaccine a year or so ago got such a horrible case of shingles her face cracked and bled just trying to eat.
18744,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: I had shingles that affected the nerve linking to the ears. Just imagine the pain is pulsing and will not go away as if someone tickles your inner ears but it will never stop even when you try to sleep. Its like under torture.
18747,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Wife got it one week after her 50th. She had the vaccine scheduled to be done. Too late. Still has periodic pain from in 5 years later. I agree. Get the vaccine.
18752,I was diagnosed a few days ago with shingles. I am 35 and healthy and prior to this had not considered shingles a concern but I guess I was wrong The entire process of getting diagnosed has been so traumatic and infuriating. My first symptoms were extreme stomach cramping nausea and diarrhea that persisted for several days. Three days into that I started to feel pain in my back that quickly spread across my ribs and wrapped around my chest on the left side. By day six I woke up in such extreme pain that I had to call an ambulance. Turns out this was just the beginning of the most harrowing and frustrating week of my life. I went to the ER for the first time on a Tuesday. They first accused me of drug seeking even after I gave them my symptoms and reported that I was between an 810 on the pain scale. They then ran some cursory blood tests that did not show anything and literally just threw up their hands and said they had no idea what was wrong and could not help me. Mind you this was AFTER I showed them the rash that was already present on my back. They sent me home in excruciating pain only for me to have to return the next day because the pain remained so terrible. That time they told me that they did not even want to run more tests because they did not think it was worth it the doctor refused to even look at my rash and he said definitively that it must just be acid reflux. ACID REFLUX. It was not until the third ER visit two days later that I finally saw a competent doctor and it took him all of 15 seconds after hearing my symptoms to lift up my shirt see the rash and tell me that I had shingles. And just like that I finally started to get medications that worked and reduced my pain. The whole process was infuriating and torturous and I share all of this as a warning for others that if you suspect you might have it or a family member might ESPECIALLY if you are on the younger side you need to explicitly ask the doctors you see if it could be shingles if they can test you for shingles and if they can definitively rule it out. Otherwise you may end up in my situation writhing around in the worst pain I have ever experienced for a full week before finally figuring out what was wrong. Good luck everyone out there. Wishing you all quick and complete recoveries.
18753,3 Important Immunizations my Dr. started when I turned 50: Public service announcement Do NOT get the TDAP at the same time as your shingles shot It will kick your ass Get them separately. from experience
18755,Hello all My symptoms started 34 days ago with burningweird feeling along my upper arm. It was like someone just roughly sanded my skin and left it. I applied lotion etc. nothing helped. Then had this feeling near the wrist. I also had acute pain in my shoulderdeltoid muscle region. I had a rotator cuff strain so thought that is flared up. Then this morning I woke up with 23 coin sized raised bumpsrashes below my left shoulder. Alarm bells started ringing. My family GP is away so I consulted a doctor online through a health portal. She saw the pics etc and said its shingles and prescribed valtrex and naproxen. Asked me to start it as soon as possible. I have taken one dose and resting. I did not expect shingle to affect folks below 50 and I do not really recall having chicken pox as a child. So I am worried if this is something else. The doctor said after COVID this has become coming in younger adults. I will hopefully see my family GP Tom. Kind of quarantining myself to avoid spreading it to the family? Any precautions I should take in addition? Very worried seeing all the posts here. Fingers crossed.
18758,Overhearing an old lady at an urgent saying she will not get an RSV vaccine because of the arm soreness.
18759,41 and got Shingles: Nine weeks sounds like hell uff
18764,I am a male 27. I first started getting a slight itch and had some bumps appear on the shaft of my penis around midJune this year. The bumps disappeared after a few days however the itch remained on and off for the next month before I finally decided to go and get tested end of July. I was not even going to test for HPV however my doc suggested that I test. A couple of days later I received a positive report with strains 16 and 6 detected. Unfortunately a few days after doing my test I also happened to move to a new country that does not have proper sexual health clinics or facilities and I was unable to find any docs overseas who would consult online so my only source of knowledge was the internet and this forum thanks to everyone for sharing so much knowledge and insight regarding this virus. I followed the basics regarding cleanliness however I have not quit smoking I eat a normal diet but have not gone out of my way to eat healthy or anything and have not been working out. By August there was a tiny black raised but smooth wart on the base of my penis and another two even smaller ones on the shaft one which is literally a raised dot. There was also a similar wart on the side of my scrotum. It was not until mid October when I finally traveled to a country with a sexual health docdermatologist. The first doc I visited told me that the warts are tiny and I do not need to do anything. The second doc I saw suggested podyphiline 25 solution. Since i read online that podyphiline should be applied by a doc and the doc had suggested 2 weeks of treatment I was unable to go ahead with the treatment since I was only in this country for a few days before I had to return back to the country where I Am currently living. So now its mid December and here are the latest developments in the past 2 months I have noticed that the color of the skin on the shaft of my penis has darkened. My balls also seems to get really itchy on some days not sure if this is because of the long hair since I stopped shaving after my diagnosis and there are some more black marks that have appeared around my scrotum and a couple on my shaft however all of these are flat and look like beauty spots. The original 4 raised black bumpswarts I had noticed have remained the same size. So here are my questions as the first doc suggested is not doing anything an option? I understand that over time my immune system might control the virus but does that mean that the warts will disappear on their own as well? Has any other male experienced general darkening of skin on their penis after testing positive? Edit forgot to mention that I was not vaccinated before my diagnosis and got my first dose of gardasil in Oct this year. I will be getting my second this month as well.
18769,Getting RSV shot during pregnancy? Triple check they give you the right one.: This happened to me too. It was a year ago when the vaccines first came out. My daughter is almost 1 and she is had no negative side effects from me receiving the wrong vaccine. We did go ahead around 6 months and get her the one for children under 2. I am really sorry to hear you had this same experience. I would be happy to provide details about what we did as a result to ensure there were not any adverse effects. Just send me a DM.
18770,Help. I Am so scared. Long story short our heat in our truck went out so my mom had to take us to my babies appointment Tuesday . Hes 37 weeks now. My 13 year old sister held him for about 5 minutes. Used sanitizer but come to find out Wednesday she starts getting signs of being sick and was feeling hot to the touch. She went to the drs today and she has rsv which is my biggest freaking fear. He got his rsv shot Sunday before leaving the nicu but I am so scared.
18771,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: Coworker got shingles showed up in her mouth. 2 days later had paralysis of the right side of her face. Could take up to a year to regain what was lost if she gets it back at all. Super scary shingles nothing to mess with.
18772,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had it on my forehead and it was basically like a bad case of acne. did not really hurt more than painful pimples.
18775,TIFU by Unintentionally Taking Truck Stop Heroin' to Avoid a Trip to the ER.: I wish I could give you a more thorough reply but it hurts really badly to type. A lot of what you said makes so much sense. I have Mesial Temporal Sclerosis. I also have hypothyroidism and have had shinglesnerve damage twice before I was 25 but this pain is so much more intense than that. I was magnesium deficient which is weird because I take one of each mag supplement daily they hung a bag of that. They said they ruled out GuillaneBarre they tried to relieve the pain with several drugs Norco Toradol Morphine etc. none were effective on my discharge notes it says peripheral neuropathy I was given a referral to a neurologist and a short script for Percocet which also is not working. They did all they could but I am still in 1010 pain. I cannot live like this it is torture. Two weeks ago I was fine now I cannot walk on my own and even holding my phone to write this is awful. Calling the Neuro and PCP shopping on Monday
18788,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah I never got chicken pox and did not get the vaccine until I was 17.
18789,Shingles vaccine experience: I got both and never felt anything but a sore arm at the injection site. Hope it goes well.
18792,Shingles: Ok cool I really did not want to wait 2 months to start Rinvoq but I may end up anyways as I have to be off it for 30 days prior to surgery according to my ortho and he is booking a month out. I also got the flu vaccine but not sure on when I last had DTAP so may need to look at that one. I am on MTX tried both Otezla and Enbrel which both caused a skin based reaction so Rinvoq is next up to bat.
18797,Shingrix: I also know someone who developed serious recurring shingles as a result of getting Shin gri x ironically
18799,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles is very painful. A sore arm for a day is nothing in comparison. Very effective and side effects from vaccine happen to a very low percentage of people that got vaccinated. I know someone who got shingles and went into her eye and is now blind in that eye. She wish she got the vaccine and only had a sore arm to deal with.
18801,"Extreme case of Shingles: I have the same. The first month I had to let my head drip dry after a shower. Could not even pat a towel softly on it. Worst pain of my life. Used to freak out when I would think about having this the rest of my life. Still do sometimes, but getting used to being in pain 24/7 I guess...no choice. Can go hours without thinking about it now. Had an ER doc put his hand on my shoulder and give me a real look of sympathy, like I had just lost a very close loved one or something terrible...spooked me at the time...never had a doctor do that to me. Now I understand."
18805,The first officially positive phase 2 for us ? Celecoxib  Valtrex: So I had shingles and I took valtrex before bed I woke up and my limbs felt like concrete and the bed was rocking like a boat. I finally got up and stumbled across the room like I was on a boat. then the thoughts started. Like there were voices in my head telling me to go to the bathroom and kill myself I have never been suicidal the voices kept telling me awful things I was visualizing all the crazy shit like I was in a very bad lsd trip. About three hours in I woke my husband and told him to take me to the hospital and he called poison control. The pharmacist said that it is a very rare side effect but it is definitely documented side effect and to just hold on and it will stop in another 35 hours. I was manic and having hallucinations and I have zero history of mental health diseases. It stopped and I Am fine but the thought of that drug hell no I just googled it I guess I had neurotoxicity from it they do not know why because my kidneys were fine
18806,TLDR I am looking for feedback on the Vanderbilt post Covid clinic or other Covid clinics in the area please. I am currently in Middle Tennessee Nashville. Not where I first got Covid or received medical treatment but where I am now. 41F Had first covid Feb2020. I do not know what to say. It has been horrid. I have deleted my Covid posts because of how early it happened for me my DMs were flooded with desperate pleas for information which I myself did not and still do not have. I am vaccinated and boosted but have had Covid since then too. Much less severe with vaccine. Also keep getting shingles. Am not vaccinated for shingles. Got mixed messages on that from doctors. When I first had Covid I had intense symptoms. Coughing up blood oxygen dropped to 70 several times. I remember more my experiences with seeking care. Having doctors refuse to enter the room wearing full face shields masks hazmat like suits telling me to leave the hospital because there was nothing they could do for me. It was not until FEMA came that I was treated with compassion of any kind. I was thankful for them. Their smiling faces and gentle touches. I have been living with neurological issues physical issues mental issues. When I first started to recognize the alarming symptoms I started to see specialists. Internists cardiologists neurologists endocrinologists pulmonologists allergists ENTs the list goes on. They could not pinpoint any because or provide any treatment. Eventually found a website where you could order your own tests and a doctor would send it in for you. Got a ton of those that led nowhere too. For the first two years I fought. Then I settled on wasting away and hoping to die. Some symptoms have improved. My hair has stopped falling out and feels healthier. My legs had become wildly swollenstiff and doctors told me it was lymphedema. Oddly that stopped on its own when I moved states. Only occasionally do I have real trouble breathing. Some things never improved. My balance is still awful. I often feel like I am falling or floating. Especially when I am tired or trying to sleep. I fall often. Had a very bad fall at a work teambuilding field day event. Knees will not recover from that one. Have fallen going up and down the stairs. Sense of taste and smell comes and goes. Temperature is all over the place. Other things have gotten worse. My brain fog which was heart breaking because my brain was the only thing I loved about myself evolved. Now it is scarier. Best of time it is just aphasia and peripheral hallucinations. Worst times it is lost time disorientationnot know where I am how I got there. Sometimes I find out during that lost time I did something out of character that I cannot explain. Other times I am staring off into space and cannot be reached. I also occasionally lose a motor skill which I absolutely cannot recover. Even with help. Braiding my hair folding a shirt knotting some yoga poses. Odd stuff. I am so scared I have dementia. Memory is a constant struggle I feel like I experience constant epiphanies and loss. I will be like oh I should do this thing then before I can even smile at my thought I have forgotten the thing I should do only remembering that I thought I should do something. I am trying to get ADA protection at work for the symptoms that I can. So that means it is doctor time again. I am at a crossroads. Either I try a Covid clinic which was not an option when I started this journey or I end it. I cannot continue like this. I am miserable so miserable. And scared. I would love to hear if anyone has received novel treatment in my area that worked for them. I worry they will not have much I have not tried already. But the good thing about my feeble mind is that I can also imagine a fairy tale and lie to myself to buy me a week days or hours of hope. So sorry if this difficult to read. I did my best to make it make sense. Thank you.
18807,"Shingrix vaccine under 50?: I'm 36F and currently dealing with PHN after my second bout of shingles in three years. As far as we know, I don't have any underlying conditions, just bad luck with shingles. My doctor suggested I look into potentially getting the Shingrix vaccine, but my insurance absolutely will not cover this for anyone under 50. Have any of my fellow younger shingles suffers tried getting the vaccine? Is this something that would be worth it and do-able if I was able to pay for it out of pocket? Also, the reason my insurance won't consider covering it for any circumstances is because Shingrix is not FDA approved for anyone under 50. And interestingly, the CDC website says that side effects tend to be worse for younger recipients (I guess that would be the early 50s crowd?). So now I'm sort of wondering, was there a good reason for the FDA not to approve it for younger people? I assumed that it wasn't approved for people under 50 because it wasn't worth the time, effort, and money for the drug company to get it approved for younger age groups. But could it be that it actually has the potential for adverse effects for younger people? I have zero medical background by the way, just sort of wondering aloud here."
18809,Vaccine question: The shingles advice is a bit weird. you can only get shingles if you have had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine because it is essentially a reactivation of your past infection. I have had shingles and it was awful so I always advocate for getting the vaccine where possible.
18810,Shingles shot: My brother in law got it and he has not been able to feel his right hand since. I think Ill pass.
18811,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I just came down with a terrible flucold.. why did I read this..
18812,Is Shringrix still considered the new vaccine I got it a few years ago good only for 5 yrs bummer. The only way I knew I had chickenpox was getting tested in my 30s I have no pox scars. I Have had at least 2 eps of shinglesno fun.
18813,I have my immunizations. I have had TDAP shingles pneumonia and life long immunity from measels mumps pox Hepatitis B and have a regular test for TB. I do not want the MNRA vaccine I was force to take the covid vaccine so I took Johnson vaccine Was sick for weeks
18820,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Yep. Get it. 2 doses. Lifetime protection. Just felt like someone punched me in the arm for a couple days. You should not need a referral.
18826,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born in '83. Chicken pox party. Do not remember what age though. Edit Oh yeah and I got Shingles last year. But I was looking into it while I was going through it and I had a couple deviations from the norm. The timeline was exact to the letter and the fact that it typically only hits one side but supposedly it is supposed to mostly affect the torso and maybe neck and face but extending to the limbs is rare. I Only got it on my right arm. And also after it is over it is supposed to heal up entirely with no evidence pretty quickly but almost a year later I have pretty obvious scarring.
18829,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: I had shingles last year kind of sucked. I am getting my second round vaccine this week not looking forward to it but better than getting shingles again.
18831,I have been fortunate not to have shingles for a little while now. I get them a lot more often because of my transplant medication suppressing my immune system. I had chicken pox as a child and never had any shingles until my 40s after transplant. I am not a candidate for the vaccine but I do not do vaccines anyway. I normally have a good supply of antivirals. I had to switch all my doctors and pharmacies and everything this year because of changes to my insurance so catching up and getting all of my prescriptions redone has been tedious. I am in the middle of getting ready to move and going through all of my stuff. I just recycled a bunch of old medications which included 2 big bottles hundreds of pills of my anti viral. It is my birthday weekend and my body decided to kick it off with a case of the shingles. I think it is because I was eating these pumpkin tortilla chips from Trader Joes so darn good. If I eat a lot of food that is high in arginine I have a much higher chance of an outbreak. When I get really busy like this I eat c food snacking too much and I am sure the chocolate has not helped. Normally it is no big deal I take my needs and supplements and begin to recover. I could not believe that I had no medication left on hand. If only I could go back and save just a few of those pills that I dumped in the recycle bin at the pharmacy. I have not had to show anyone my shingles for like 12 years. The first time I got it was so bad I did not know what was happening to me. It was so uncomfortable for weeks but I just kept putting it off. I get my shingles where the sun do not shine like really down in there. So I tried calling the doctor and they would not help me since the doctor does not know anything about me taking this medication and he was gone for the weekend. All my earlier prescriptions have expired. It was Friday night and there were not many options left. So I get in my broken down little old car to drive a really long way to get to the specific urgent care I am told I need to go to with my insurance. I wait in line and find out that they only take one of my insurances. I cannot afford to get a bill so I go to the hospital ER which is just up the road. I could not believe how ridiculously packed the place was people puking and coughing and scaring me to death. I started getting bad anxiety and just decided to leave. It is good I did because I came home and completely passed out from exhaustion. So now I am sitting here with Indian clay mask on my bum trying to dry out the blisters. It does seem to help. I am just hoping that my doctor will renew my prescription next week and not make me show him the blisters. Like can a photograph do? I have been single for so very long I have just become a bit of a prude have not had to expose private things to prying eyes for some time. I do not even go to the gynecologist anymore. I did take Lysine and Monolaurin. I worry a bit about Lysine though after recently coming across info on some risk factors. Need to do more research...
18833,41 and got Shingles: Yes I got shingles in my mid40's and it was hell I do not have an autoimmune disease but I was dealing with alot of stress at the time and I think that was a contributing factor. It was extremely painful and I still get phantom pain in the same area of my body that it spread. It is so important to get treatment as soon as possible. I have since gotten my 2 shingles vaccinations and highly recommend you do that too
18836,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had actual shingles had scabby skin lesions all over my face from upper lip to my ear with a really bizarre combo of pain and itching. Eating was hugely painful because the affected nerve was also in my mouth. Had eye symptoms for two months in which it was ice pick painful to be in bright light uveitis. Flash forward 20 years and that nerve is still numb like having a dental procedure. Any vaccine symptoms are mild compared with this.
18837,Good morning I hope your weekend was better than mind. That Shingles vaccine is no joke All good now but whew that was a doozy.
18839,Anyone feel like they got hit by a bus after getting Shingrix Vaccine?: I think I started feeling lousy that night full effects the next day. A little better the day after that then fine.
18840,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: Yes I felt crappy after each for a couple of days. I think its your body reacting so its a good thing least that is what I told myself I Am rarely ill but had a friend describe it as nerve endings on fire. I consider her a bit of a badass scheduled the first shot the next day.
18841,33M Supposed shingles: To add rash is across the waist underneath both armpits behind both legs across the back of the neck and side of the neck lower back buttocks. The itching is just so intense and wakes us up at around 1am and has not improved much which is worrying. I have a follow up appointment in around five days or less but a second opinion here would really help. Tingling and burning pain in the nerves also happens very often with itching. Edit no allergies. No changes at home at all. All products used including detergentbody products are scent less clean and clear and or hypoallergenic. We live in SEA where the climate is hot and humid but our environment at home is very dry and cool. 1st doctor already treated for fungal and there was no improvement it only got much worse. After antivirals things did not get worse but the itching is still intense.
18843,Shingles? Rinvoq? Pain before rash after Covid booster: Thanks for your reply. I did not realise that a booster could affect AS symptoms. I have a friend who suffers from bad migraines and each time they get a booster they have a relapse into a cycle of migraines.
18845,Just injected my first dose of 0.25: I am high fiving you Just started my first dose 2 days ago and I have GAD too. I was all over the place in the hours leading up to the shot. Sweating almost hyperventilating . Did the shot in my stomach with my husband nearby because I have a track record of needles making me faint but I did it and nothing bad happened. You are right I barely felt it. Its going to be great
18847,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I was among the first to get the vaccine my mom wanted to be extra sure and tried to get me to get it from a friend anyway. Vaccine worked anyway
18849,Oh no My husband had shingles last summer and I knew I never wanted that Have both vaccines he also got the vaccine so hopefully he cannot get that again. Hope you get some relief soon
18856,Had the second shingles shot: I actually had the same experience. The first one was pretty rough but the second was not a big deal. So glad I got them
18861,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: You most like had chickenpox but the vaccine caused you to be a symptomatic. And it does not prevent latency for varicella just the symptoms. You do not want chickenpox as an adult though
18863,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I had them often. Got the shingrix vaccine and got a few years I was good. They Are still a recurring problem but since I switched most of my running to zone 2 they come out a lot kites frequently. I still get them after covid flu RSV etc.
18866,i got shingles after being vaccine and never having chicken pox: It s quite possible you had chicken pox in your early childhood but your symptoms weren t evident enough to notice.
18868,Shingles vaccine experience: My partner had shingles on his scalp face and IN his eye and ear. Even with antivirals very early on he was in terrible pain and spent a lot of time doing eye drops and ear drops seeing eye specialists etc. after witnessing that first hand I would get this jab. I Have made an appointment to do so between Christmas and New Year.
18870,: This is horrific It makes you terrified that people like myself i have had two shots refused the booster are now becoming worried sick that any day you could just drop dead Dear god what have these people done to us
18875,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Both doses hit me hard. However after seeing my friend suffer for weeks with the shingles I will take 1 day in bed feeling a bit unwell with pleasure.
18876,Shingles vaccine: Did you have a titer test to verify? I thought you only got shingles if you had chicken pox? That they are chicken pox part 2I might be completely wrong though. My doc insisted I must have just had a nonsymptomatic case when I asked her to check in my 40s there were two cases at work and I was not in a place to catch it. Titer test proved me right and she rushed to get me the chicken pox vaccinewhich was pretty rough on me.
18877,Bout of shingles after getting the shot?: Getting shingles anywhere on or around your face sounds awful. Hopefully you are feeling better now. I know they say that the shot does not actually give you shingles but the side effects were pretty intense at least for me. So it makes me wonder if it did not add to whatever day to day stress I was already having to make me more susceptible to an outbreak
18878,Shingles vaccine: I got mine and really glad about it every time I hear someone is horror story who did not and the got shingles. My 68 yr old aunt is miserable right now.
18880,Shingles vaccine while on a highdose prednisone taper before starting a biologic?: Yes I was feeling panicky yesterday like I had to rush but I do not think its the case
18881,PLEASE HELP MEEE: I had one cluster behind my ear down my neck. And it was only about 45 blisters. If you go early enough you can get an anti viral to limit the negative effects nerve issues etc.
18885,Had the second shingles shot: Mine hurt but has to be better than shingles
18887,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I ended up getting HPV that turned precancerous and had to get biopsies every six months for two years until it finally cleared up they asked if I had ever received my HPV shots. I asked my mom and she told me she opted to not have us vaccinated for HPV because she did not think I would sleep around. I do not think a lot of women even know they have not been vaccinated.
18891,The shingles vaccine sucks.: I was just foolish enough to get the flu and COVID vaccines at once. It still fucked me up.
18893,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: What are you using for pain? My doc put me on Gaba pent in at first for nighttime that stuff left me stranded 3 hours into an 8 hour dose. cannot mix anything or split a dose so I was in agony until daylight until I could get something else. How is the very tip of your nose? I was able to spend the day out and about today and I feel fairly pain free so maybe I can go back to work next week and rebuild our savings. I wish you a speedy recovery and a massive lack of pain.
18896,The Truth About Shingles Why You Get It And How To Heal It Fast: I have had shingles 3 times before I was 46 yo. The last one occurred about a year AFTER I finished the shingles vaccine 2 separate injections spaced apart. Thankfully I have not had since. Two times was on my right side chest and once in the same area but on the left side. Fingers crossed I never have to deal with shingles again having it once was more than enough but 3 times is my limit.
18897,Shingles vaccine second dose: I had Covid and shingles in the same arm on the same day. I have been avoiding the second shot but I should be a big kid and get it over with. Having had shingles as a 40yearold I can say without hesitation that having it is WAY worse than the shots so if there is anyone out there who is on the fence about getting it DO IT.
18900,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I encourage you all to get shingle vaccine as soon as possible. I tried to get the jab last year and they said I would not be eligible to have it covered by insurance until my 50th birthday this year. Then I came down with like two months later brought on by extreme stress. It was on my lower back and side right where waistbands hit on pants skirts and underwear You All it was worse than I remember chickenpox being. Thankfully I was able to get a Gabapentin prescription to help with the discomfort. Also was able to work from home and just wore dresses for a while thanks goodness. You can bet your sweet bippy I got it on my birthday as soon as the pharmacy opened.
18901,Shingles vaccine: I was a little sore but not really sick. Ill take a sore arm over shingles any day. I Have seen too many young people in their 30s get it from being stressed and I have seen my elderly inlaws get it and it was not fun either time.
18910,Has anyone else gotten a covid booster AND shingles at the same appointment?: Checking in SAME OMG there are bowling balls in my deltoids
18914,41 and got Shingles: My BIL got them when my oldest niblet was born. I think he was about 32 at the time. They were caused by stress. I understand I lived with my sister for the first 18 years of her life.
18917,"Tingling scalp, day 4 with shingles rash: Has anyone experienced tingling scalp with shingles? My rash is on my abdomen on the right side but i definitely have felt tingling in my scalp for the last 10 days since the pain started. I'm concerned and wondering if My shingles transferred there? Can that happen? Or is this a side effect of the antivirals? Probably not considering i have felt this sensation less extremely in the last 10 days..."
18921,"Under 50 Shingles Vaccine Question: The medical community at large does not like giving 'elderly vaccines' to younger patients. This is a case where you may have to bully your provider a little. I've found it helpful to ask that they document that they're not doing this despite medical history and why. (My experience is in the US.) But that's not going to do anything at a pharmacy at Walmart/Walgreens/CVS/etc so you might need to find an office that does it in house or an urgent care doctor that is willing to do it. I'm a big advocate for vaccines, will be pushing for the shingles vaccine the second my rash is gone, and this will hopefully be my second ""old person"" (and my husband teasingly puts it) vaccine this year."
18922,Big Day: I got mine because I try to visit my fully vaccinated 91 year old mom whenever I can we are a few states away. My RSV vaccine was not free even with insurance 60 but I did not care. A suggestion get your pertussis whopping cough. I had it a few months ago and since I panicked thinking that I had covid even being vaccinated my doctor prescribed a heavy dose of antibiotics and it still sucked. Just got my furst if the 2 shingles vaccines as well. I am a veritable pin cushion. But outside of the whopping am intent on staying safe and healthy. I get most of my vaccines at my local Walmart.
18923,Absolutely Unfortunately for me I never went back for my second dose I was so sick with shingles. In my face and left eye. NO ONE needs to go through thiy
18925,Beats getting shingles. I had a mild case of shingles last year the pain was unbearable. The reason it was a mild case is because I had the vaccine.
18926,Shingles vaccine experience: My dad just almost died from shingles. A little shot pain is nothing compared to what he went through. We were spoon feeding him bone broth the nerve pain was so bad he could not chew or move.
18928,Shingles at 35: I am shocked these doctors put you through all that. I am on day 19 of shingles I know how traumatizing it is I thought I had poison oak. I researched rash shooting pain and found the info on shingles knew right away it was shingles. I researched natural treatment and Dr Mandell said to take 3000 mg of lysine and 3000 mg of vitamin C some olive leaf and B12. I suffered with massive pain headaches stomach cramps horrible sores on my chest and back for 7 days. After the lysine was started everything got better Check it out for yourself. It puts the zoster virus into a state where is does not keep replicating. Do Not eat foods with arginine zoster feeds on this amino acid. Wishing you well here is the video
18938,Getting my first Shingles shot today: Good call. Shingles made me very sick and I have permanent nerve damage. It also caused 5 years of chronic migraine due to nerve damage and muscular mass loss in the shoulder.
18939,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I was pretty sore for both shots but I Have seen people with Shingles. Shots are a no brainer in comparison
18943,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I usually bouce back pretty quickly from other shots. This is one is on a whole different level. Crossing my fingers the second one is easier.
18944,Long covid shingles I Am just so done with this: I Am so sorry COVID caused shingles for me in 2020. Unfortunately due to lock downs I did not get anti vitals in time. It caused a lot of issues for me. I know it can feel like the worst sunburn on top of the most painful bruise. Lidocaine patches cold aloe gel and gabapentinhorizant helped some. Stay on top of your doctors as you navigate the aftermath of shingles. I developed post heretic neuralgia and lost the ability to walk in my right leg. It took two years to recover. Also some patients are experiencing multiple shingles outbreaks back to back. My neuro suspects that is what happened to me and told me she is seeing it more frequently. Keep advocating for yourself and I hope you get some relief soon.
18949,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: Make sure you get the 2nd dose. I completely forgot to get the 2nd dose and wham I got the shingles a few weeks later. After recovery I got the 2nd dose lesson learned.
18950,Hepatitis B RSV vaccine on Preemies: We did. Kiddo was in the hospital at 2 months old so she got her first round there. She got the first Synergis shot there as well.
18952,Definitely worth getting. I had an awful attack of shingles in my eye after a lot of stress. I had long lasting side effects even now the nerves can prickle. You told me I needed the vaccine I did not realise. I had that one and then Shringlex.
18954,Allergic reaction putting me in DKA?: I went into DKA when I got shingles and it developed into viral sepsis. Any illness that increases metabolic demand is a risk.
18956,"Flu vaccine reaction or neurological symptoms in a young adult >>> Seeking support <<<: Sharing a concerning experience and seeking advice from the community. 26-year-old male, non-smoker, occasional drinker, 165 lb, 6'0 tall, generally healthy and active lifestyle, no chronic medical conditions. Recently received the flu vaccine and started experiencing unusual neurological symptoms a week later. Developed headaches, dizziness, and tingling sensations in the extremities. Visited a neurologist who ordered an MRI, which revealed no abnormalities. Symptoms persist, making daily activities challenging. Wondering if these symptoms could be related to the flu vaccine and seeking guidance on the next steps to take. Feeling frustrated and anxious about the unknown cause of these symptoms. Open to hearing from others who have encountered similar reactions post-vaccination or healthcare professionals with insights on neurological reactions to vaccines. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. ---"
18957,Shingrix: Shingrix was first approved in the US in 2017 so there is no way you got it 15 years ago. There used to be a shingles vaccine called vaccine that was only one dose. People who got that one are recommended to get Shingrix both doses of it now. I have had both because I am ancient It is safe but the new one knocks you on your butt for both doses.
18959,Rsv: My baby just got the rsv shot at his 6 m appointment and he did not even run a fever
18960,: No Surprise that Major Tom's Survey was Ignored in Australia. It seems that they are Suppressing All Negative Discussion. Two days ago I sent a link to Dr John's Video regarding Blood Clots to my 60 year old Brother in Australia who last week had a Heart Attack but he could not open the link. It seems that Australia may be Blocking His Videos. My Brother has had 1 Pfizer and 2 astrazeneca Zeneca Shots.
18961,2nd Bout of Mild Shingles in 3 months but reaction to Valtrex this time?: I'm curious how you know those symptoms are due to the medicine and not the illness? Those sound like my symptoms without meds. At least I think.
18965,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: My husband had shingles in his brain and had to be hospitalized for a week while receiving IV antivirals. It was horrible and I would not wish it on anyone. Seeing how serious the damages are and could be in the future this seems like an intentional tort lawsuit to me.
18966,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: The Shingles vaccine kicked my assmost vaccinations haventbut I Have seen the horror of someone with shingles and a day or two of feeling like shit is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT when compared to the actual disease.
18971,Health Update I Lost Everything: Sad to hear. Shingles is very common after mrna vaccines.
18972,: Same thing happened to my Test Director got the vaccines like a good lad. Two months later he had to get a pace maker placed on his heart. Just saw him again and man he looked scary. Australia and New Zealand really went bananas on taking shots. If this goes badly there will not be a single person in those two countries.
18975,CVS is Now Offering Shingles Vaccines for Under 50 YOs: In July my husband turned 40. In August he went down with Shingles. Two months later he finally felt normal again. I will absolutely be getting the vaccine. Thank you for mentioning this kind person.
18976,Of all the things to take me down...SHINGLES? C'mon man. OK. So I have got shingles. If you do not know what that is you can think of it as a painful version of adult chickenpox. I am about a week into the misery and started taking antibiotics EDIT ANTIVIRALS 24hours ago. I am very tired and lethargic and the rash areas are painful I even thought I had broken a rib. I have two ultra runs scheduled in the next two months a 54miler on September 7th and my first shot at 100miles at Javelina on October 26th. Before shingles I was training hard in the Los Angeles heat and getting in 40ish miles a week with a lot of elevation gain. I was in great shape. Does anyone have experience running after a bout of shingles? How long did it take you to fully recover? How much training juice did you lose? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks
18977,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I Am in my 50s and got chickenpox as a kid prevaccine. I got shingles in my 40s. Doctors will only prescribe the newish shingle vaccine after you are 50 years old. Shingles was excruciating painful For two weeks it felt like my right side was sunburned with sandpaper rubbed just under my skin with painful electric shocks rippling through. I would just lie on my left side and cry. Then I got postherpetic pain which happens in about 10 of cases. The nerve pain persisted for 7 months on an almost daily basis. I had to take meds that made me feel awful. It took forever to subside. I still had to work a demanding job and I was exhausted constantly. Then my job laid me off and my beloved husband died unexpectedly within three days and the pain came back for almost another year. Four years later and I could be having no issues for a month and bam the pain will go searing down my right arm or explode along my rib cage. Trish is a fucking idiot. Her son the other idiot is the apple that did not fall far from the tree. But unfortunately its not unheard of. When I first got shingles the idiot governor at the time of my state sent his kids to a chickenpox party to expose them. This was 2018 Hes no longer governor and his wife is divorcing him and its contentious.
18978,"""Concerned about the lack of tracking for Shingrix vaccine reactions: Hello, I got the Shingrix vaccine a few years ago, and last month, I had a terrible outbreak of Shingles. The pain has been overwhelming, and I'm still struggling to manage it. I find it concerning that there isn't much information available about breakthrough infections with this vaccine. While I still believe in the importance of getting vaccinated, I think it's crucial to have better tracking and awareness of potential reactions. Has anyone else faced a similar situation?"""
18981,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got the RSV vaccine while pregnant with my son. I had a friend whose son had a really scary battle with a respiratory illness and wanted to give my baby whatever defenses I could with him being born in winter. Shortly after he turned a year old he ended up in the hospital after picking up RSV from daycare around Christmas. He was having trouble breathing and it was terrifying. But he recovered quickly. My husband got really sick with it too but I only had minor symptoms. Not sure if it had to do with the vaccine I received over a year beforehand but I wonder if I did not get nearly as sick as I would have because of it.
18982,Doctor accidentally double vaccinated our 2 month old at his 2 month appointment.: I did it for my 2 month old before Thanksgiving get together. Because it is not actually a vaccine. It does not have all the toxic additives like formaldehyde and aluminum. Vaccines usually contain a small amount of the virus to activate the immune response against it to get the baby to PRODUCE their own antibodies. The RSV shot for newborns beyfortus is not a vaccine. It is a direct injection of antibodies to RSV. This is why I said yes to this one. He had absolutely zero reaction to it
18983,So I have 33F been dealing with chronic pain for about twenty years. I started having back problems in highschool have gotten shooting pains in my neck and strange sensations in my legs like cold water running down or the feeling of heat pressing on my shins. Sometimes my legs itch horribly for no reason and the only thing that helps is sitting in boiling hot water. I have gone down the diagnostic route and heard everything from degenerative disks to fibromyalgia. It is only been recently that I have seen anything about neuralgia. That is when it struck me that I had a rare case of shingles as a child. It was all over my face and I almost went blind. I do not remember lot of it as I was around 9 or 10 but I am beginning to wonder if my issues could stem from that. I have seen a lot of talk about postherpetic neuralgia affecting the site of the shingles but what about further down the nerve chain. If you have damage at the top of the tree would not everything below be affected? I do not remember if the rash trailed around to the back of my neck but my neck pain is on the same side as the rash was on my face. Just tired and looking for answers. There is almost no research on pediatric Herpes Zoster. Not asking for diagnostics just hoping to connect with anyone else that might be dealing with chronic long term affects.
18986,vaccine question hep B shingles etc.: I am reinforcing what the person you responded to said. You need to get the Shingles vaccine if you have had the chicken pox. The vaccine itself sucks but I would rather go through that again than get the shingles. I had chicken pox at 22 and it sucked I got vaccinated for shingles right after I turned the big 50. A year later I got lucky to get diagnosed with UC. I am glad I got the shots there are 2 needed for the shingles vaccine before this horrible disease.
18990,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: That Is not how vaccines work. They take time to program and educate your body on how to fight and needs 2 doses. I Am 1 dose in and feel fine again after 36hrs of feeling off. Dealable short term side effects vs. Groin shingles that because horrific pain and leaves scars ill take a vaccine lol. Measles mumps reblla hpv etc work by reducing risk to effective 0. Shingles vac reduces to low single digit risks of having a new flare up in healthy people and if you do its minimized.
18991,Just got my confirmed results today. I have had it for over a week now and it has only spread a little on my left palm. When the blisters first showed up I thought it was a type of blistering eczema so I waited a few days to get it checked. Do not wait. She said if I would have come in the first 72 hours they have a medication they could have tried. Now it is just put Vaseline or things of the sort to relieve pain. I am okay with this though as long as it does not spread further onto my body Definitely going to get the vaccine when I turn 50 Also mine does not itch so do not let not itching deter you from thinking it is shingles. It just feels like burning blisters hurts really bad if it is touched. Get it checked AS SOON AS POSSIBLE anytime you develop a rashblisters
18992,Hey everyone. This is my first Reddit post ever despite being a user for years so I hope that shows you how genuinely scared I am that I have rabies particularly paralytic rabies. A year ago on June 27th 2023 I was viciously attacked by a German Shepherd that bit me around 20 times in my lower extremities feet ankles shin calves under my left buttocks and the deepest goriest one was a perfect 2 fang puncture on my right thigh just above the knee. I did not get any immediate care besides a couple bandaids and wound rinse in the shower the morning after because I was overwhelmed with the amount of police officers blood and horror and I was suspended in the shock of realizing that someone I trusted was an abusive psychopath. I was left for dead for days until the wounds healed and there was nothing else to be done. During that time I was sick with something but I know my ex was sick beforehand and likely gave it me. The symptoms were a pounding headache perhaps a cough or sneeze but at this point I do not recall. I flew to my home state about a week after the event to get away from the abuser and the trauma. I was further neglected at my home not getting treated to care for about a month which forced me to fly back to the city and take my treatment in own hands. I would have done this before but I physically could not walk nor could I drive. I still wish I had done it sooner. My doctor gave me a tetanus shot but refused to give me the rabies vaccine because it had been 6 weeks and if it was rabies it would have taken place by now he claimed. It was a domesticated dog so he stated that it would have been vaccinated but I genuinely do not know if that is the case given that the owner is a sick motherfucker. Also I read that a vaccinated dog can still transmit rabies at a rate between 0.160 depending on the number of bites and the depth which was A LOT MORE THAN NORMAL. I now know that the owners are no longer in possession of the dog but I Am not sure if it is dead or alive. They also refused me physical therapy because they are negligent and said nothing seemed wrong. But I Am sorry who under any circumstances would be okay after being mauled by a German Shepherd? Lo and behold by October 2023 I cannot walk. My legs were hard as a rock sometimes the right one where the vampire bite is sometimes the left sometimes both. I remember I screamed out in excruciating pain at the slight touch of my sisters hand to my knee. I started getting steroid injections in the prominent scars. I was at a rehab in November and was taking muscle relaxers so I do not remember the pain and honestly everything up until February is a blur. I did see a neurologist and get a lower back mri seemingly fine and started taking gabapentin. It was always hard to stand especially for long periods time. It was hard to do everything sit lie down walk shower move. I kind of just pushed through it. I have a high pain tolerance the only noise I made during the attack was a single slightly muttered ow. Mid January right before my final round of steroid injections a bite on my left shin blew up rapidly with an infection and exploded. Id show pictures but it makes me gag. I took antibiotics for that and moved on. I guess at some point it became unbearable again and by AprilMay I was in intensive physical therapy acupuncture massage. The first day I came in my leg was solid as a rock. It helped initially but I recently noticed a plateau in improvement I suppose. I did notice however that the pain moved from the area of the wound my lower extremities knees ankles shin calves thigh up to my hip my PT noted a tilted pelvis possibly caused by fall impact during attack and now in the right side of my spine my right shoulder arm chest basically that whole upper right quadrant. My acupuncturist was the first to notice how intensely inflamed the right side of my spine was compared to the left. Over this past weekend I was in extreme pain in the upper right quadrant which though had been hurting for a while had never been so excruciating. I went to urgent care on Friday and obviously they were less than helpful and no one ever listens to a Black woman especially one with a history of mental illness. That day I also thought I was getting frostbite in my hands. Saturday was extremely painful the worst over the weekend and I could not move my right arm away from my side. I do not remember if there was a moment where I was not in tears. I slept with a makeshift compression thingy and woke up in a bit of relief. Sunday was better still bad and Monday was bad again where I was called into my student health center for an emergency visit. He prescribed some pain relievers but I noticed there for the first time ever there was a rashhive breakout directly on my right shoulder where all the pain was coming from. He and his supervisor said the only thing they would think it could be was shingles but because I Have never had chickenpox and it was also an atypical presentation they ruled it as unlikely. I went home in panic slept a lot like 16 hours and then I woke up and the rash was gone. Tuesday was bad my entire right side was extremely weak and I was limping limped all the way to physical therapy where they had genuine concerns. My acupuncturist noticed extreme tightness all on my right side. He had to remove all of the needles after like 2 minutes because I was having a reaction to it that Id never had before. He took them out and massaged a point on my hand and I could feel the radiation all up my arm into my shoulder. He told me that my hands and feet were extremely cold. I told him I had noticed that too and just thought it was frost bite. I told him about the shingles rash and he told me it was likely a heat rash which no one else could even tell me. I broke down and told him about how all my providers were ignoring my concerns and he validated them and genuinely listened. He took my pulse and it was quite elevated I asked him if it could be because of stress and he said stress was the last thing it could be. He says the cold hands and feet are signs that my heart is working hard that I have a strong heart and not to worry. He said he is going to do research for me but for now go home and live my life. What I think is going on is hemiparesis of paralytic rabies ascending paralysis that has traveled up from my legs and is going up my spinal cord. This could kill me at any second if so I do not know how I can be expected to go home and live my life study for a final exam that I may not even get to take. Anyway do I have rabies? What do I do? I know I need to get a blood test and I will but still I am a 21F from Georgia all alone in NYC with no family. I Am scared to walk in and take a test that tells me if I Am going to die or not. The stakes are high too high. Help? Please do not be rude or invalidating TLDR attacked by a German shepherd I have rabies methinks.
18993,got shingles from the varicella vaccine??: I started working at a hospital so they had to draw blood and run my titers. I had chickenpox as a child but apparently my cheaters weren't in the right range so they told me I needed the chickenpox vaccine. So last Tuesday when I get off of work and go to get the vaccine. Two days go by and I feel like I have a knot in the back of my neck like I pulled it. The pain was going down my left side as well. I figured it's just from being on my feet and working 12-hour shifts. Then itching started. Then this huge disgusting formation of blisters appeared. At this time I thought I had like a cold sore on the back of my neck because I do get them on my lips. I did a telehealth appointment and the nurse practitioner agreed and prescribed me an antiviral. Well things have just been progressively getting worse and worse and worse. I am so itchy. The pain is so hard to describe. I feel like it's spreading up into my scalp. I contacted my work and I said you know I went to the ER and they said it shingles and I'm pretty sure it's because I got the chickenpox vaccine because it's the only thing that makes sense. All my work kind of treated me weird at first and then all of a sudden they had the workman's comp Department contacting me. My doctor also prescribed me antivirals and gabapentin. I haven't started the ladder yet just because I have four kids and I only picked up the prescription this afternoon and I didn't know how I would react to the medication so I'm waiting until around my bedtime to take it. I have to say I've been using the Aleve x lotion on it and it's definitely helping take the edge off. I know everyone is different but I'm just wondering how much longer this is going to be like this?!! I swear it's affecting my sense of taste even my eyesight on the left is blurry. The sense of tasting through me because all of a sudden today everything just had this weird taste to it no matter what it was that I drank or ate it gave it this weird taste. And I had covid back in January and lost my sense of taste for like a couple days but it came back. This is just different. Anyone out there with similar experiences? I'm nervous about talking to the workman comp doctor on
18996,Shingles vaccine?: My rheumatologist had me get it before she would start me on MTX. For me the reaction was about the same as a tetanus vaccine. So not fun but not nearly as bad as getting shingles.
18998,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Yeah I Have had a couple of minor bouts. Between the pain of childbirth kidney stone and shinglesthe shingles was pretty awful.
18999,Shingles at 35: I got shinglesabout week after my mom passed Went to get a dress to wear for her memorial Looking in the mirror it looked like someone had hit me with a belt It started getting worse. I told the first Dr I needed Valtrex a friend had told me about it. He seemed to think that was not going to work But. He gave it to me anyway Went to urgent care the next day Dr noted it was the worst case he has ever seen yet gave me a note for work the next day no way i could go to work the shingles was on my left side under my arm leading to my left breast. It hurt to put any thing on but I did. When I had to go see the doctor. Everyone thinks they know you are pain If you have not ever had the Shingles. YOU do not know the pain til you have it yourself then you may be one of the few that is left with PHN and not knowing when its going away. Its been 2 years yes you can work with it but some days are more uncomfortable than others
19003,I Have had shingles four times and I take Valtrex daily to prevent it refusing the vaccine because a good friend of mine lost her speech and ability to walk after the vaccine
19004,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah ugh my mom told me it would help next thing I know all my pox are popping open and it hurt so bad. I am so glad we have the vaccine for kids these days. Like many others here I just barely missed the shot.
19006,More evidence of a failing immune system: I got shingles 5 months after my first Covid shot. Way too young for a typical shingles patient. did not even consider they were related at the time
19007,I am very anxiousnervous about using a needle. What do you wish you knew then that you know now?: Use the alcohol wipe on injection site. Wait a minute for it to dry Do the injection. I did not wait the first time and the site stung for about an hour after following this advice no pain. Injection does not hurt. AT ALL.
19010,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Eons ago it was 'good' to 'get it out of the way'. What idiot believes that now? I have had shingles and the medication did worse than the shingles. I have had outbreaks on my face. If someone tried to have a child be exposed to this NOW I would break them before they got that chance. I am angry about this situation.
19011,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: Yup. Got shingles last year at 38 all over stomach. Do not recommend.
19012,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Yes you can have shingles multiple times. Just finished my third major bout of shingles. This time it was on my face. Fortunately it was just the facial nerve and not the optic nerve. I Have had multiple small outbreaks 5 about the size of my hand but this was the third major outbreak. My triggers are stress and extreme fatigue. MIL dealing with cancer so that will do it. I Have just accepted that shingles are my bodys way of getting my attention to Sit Down. It sucks.
19013,"Intrigued what the medical community's opinion on the VZV vaccine being used as a functional therapy for HSV1/2. [21M]: I am a 21 year old, Male medical student from the UK. I have read research papers detailing the efficacy of the VZV vaccine in treating both genital and oral HSV1/2 outbreaks, though all papers have been either small sample sizes or novel one-off cases. I have attached the papers. [study detailing potential use of VZV to treat HSV and thus decrease HIV occurrence in sub-Saharan Africa. ](<url>) [Paper detailing one off use and therapeutic effect ](<url>) [Use of VZV and efficacy in 25 HSV patients ](<url>) I am intrigued to know the general medical opinion on such novel use of the VZV vaccine."
19015,Its the shingles vaccine that made me most uncomfortable. But if you can take the day off tomorrow its not that bad.
19016,Shingles vaccine second dose: With the first dose I did not even have a sore arm. The second one kicked my butt.
19018,mono at 17 chicken pox at 5 shingles after c19 vaccine X2
19020,Tell me about your vaccine flares: I stopped getting Covid boosters because Id end up wiped out for a good 3 weeks afterwards. I do not get out much anyway so I figured I Am fairly safe
19022,Vaccine Schedule: We are. I was vaccine injured by guardasil at 13 so I have some anxiety. I just wanted to see any reactions separately. Our pediatrician was fine with it as long as he was getting the vaccines WHICH HE IS.I would never not vaccinate my baby. I showed him the plan and I just had to make the appointments in the future for them. The only thing he said was do not you feel bad bringing them back so often for shots? Which did make me sad lol.
19026,Shingles exposure?: Thank you for this She has not gotten to the blistering part yet. As of now its just a rash. She Is about a week and a half in and its still spreading slightly but she said the new areas its spreading to are less painful than the original rashes. I Am so torn on what to do. Would hate to put ourselves at risk in case of the off chance we conceived unassisted this month. Tough call
19030,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I experienced shingles recently at 42. My primary care Dr suspected grief stress death of family member plus stress of pandemic was the culprit. You do not want shingles. I had the kind that affected my neck and ear area. I genuinely would have killed myself if my shingles symptoms had continued indefinitely. I had one week of acute nerve pain and about 10 days of recovery. The nerve pain in my ear was especially unbearable relying on Advil Tylenol and a cy clo vi r for relief. I am getting the vaccine.
19031,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: Born 1990. My mom said I was vaccinated. I caught a mild case around 11 or 12.
19032,Vaccines before going in biologic: Crohn's disease and biologics both put you at risk for getting shingles. I got shingles my freshmen year in college. It was not fun at all. Bleeding pus oozing scabs and nerve pain and itching. As soon as Shingrix came out I got it.
19036,"Well, I turned 50 a few months back, and I just got off the phone, scheduling my first colonoscopy.: I got mine a few months ago as a direct result of people on this sub urging others to do it. Remember you have to have someone sign you out and drive you home. I had to hire a taxi to get there and a medical transport service take me home. The night before is mostly restless with all the prep, but otherwise it wasn't that bad at all."
19038,Shingles Vaccine?: I had my shingles vaccine pretransplant. I also had shingles once leading up to my transplant and let me tell you that it was terrible
19039,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: I had a pilot friend who got shingles in the eye. Excruciating was her description.
19041,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Do Not get up anyone she is contagious.Help her out for Christ sake
19042,RSV vaccine Abryso because: I got it last week at a Shoppers due March 10th. No side effects minimal arm soreness relieved to hopefully pass some antibodies down to the baby
19044,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Short term feeling like crap vs losing your hearing like my mother in law plus massive pain for months. Pick one
19048,I Have had five covid shots and shingles vaccine and flu shots. And since I Have taken these I Have had none of these illnesses knock on wood.
19049,Shingles vaccine: Block out a weekend to feel like crap spent lying on the couch watching movies. Its a whole lot better than getting shingles. I watched it wreck my MIL. In the three months it took her to recover from shingles at about 60 she went from an active lady that looked and acted like she was 45 to looking like a worn and hobbled 70 year old. An absolutely brutal disease.
19050,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My father got it too and it was absolutely horrible. He had it on his sac the poor old guy. He could not walk. I got that vaccine the week I turned 50.
19053,"Just wanted to share my experience after getting the HPV vaccine. A couple of weeks after the shot, I noticed a rash on my arm and was diagnosed with shingles. I've been reading about a possible link between the HPV vaccine and shingles, but in my case, the symptoms appeared much later. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
19054,Put me out of my misery.: I had shingles in my early 40s. It was on my face in my ear and mouth. I wanted to die it was so much worse than everyone tells you. I was in so much pain. The drugs they put me on made me scaringly depressed. I got the shingles shot when i turned 50s knowing it could flair up my previous episode. While the first was nothing the second did but not nearly as bad as when i first had it. If that is going to prevent my original attack I will take it. Best wishes this will pass and SO much better than the real thing.
19056,I know how you feel. The second dose hit me hard. But it is worth it for sure. I had shingles years ago and it is a thousand times worse than the side effects of the vaccine.
19057,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles in my early 30s. Luckily it was not too bad. I guess I was stressed out or something and that caused it to happen. I had these spots on one side of the middle of my back. Weird spot for a rash from contacting something and not a place for bug bites and they told me it was shingles.
19059,I gay male had my first test ever two years ago after brief unwelcomed sexual contact and I was anally positive for 16 and a couple low risks. I then got the vaccine to at least help prevent spread and a year later tested still positive for 16 but then additionally 18. I was so confused and have yet to talk to the doc about it as I was almost completely abstinent that whole year and my only one sexual encounter was after 2 of the 3 vaccine shots with someone who also had the vaccine. My recent symptoms for the last three months have been very subtle moments of anal pain but unspecific. I cannot feel any surface abnormalities with my fingers nor does it hurt when I touch press or pass stool. The pain is just random. It has also slightly increased from a very minor pinch to a much more noticeable pain still random and brief. Has anyone else here experienced it? Or is it totally uncharacteristic of HPV? I Have never had a wart and my Pap smear from 6 months ago was neg for signs of cancer. I Have had absolutely no anal sex or even sex toy use for a whole year now. The only confirmations I Have ever had were positive for 1618 and a few low risks.
19060,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had chickenpox at 2 and shingles on my jaw at 22 after a wisdom tooth surgery. The pain was so awful my jaw was covered in spots I had to take two weeks off of work to not infect anyone. I am young enough to have missed the chickenpox vaccine becoming routine just barely. I still have lingering issues from shingles whenever I get a migraine my jaw is in immense pain too. AFAIK the jaw is an unsual place for shingles but I cannot imagine having it on the torso where it usually hits and dealing with the pain
19062,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I did No reaction except a sore arm. Just got a tdap booster yesterday too. Whooping cough is going around. If its been ten years then go get another one.
19064,I see a lot of people with ongoing sometimes permanent problems from shingles infection. Deciding not to get vaccinated against it is a choice but I certainly went and got my shingrix. At least they will have this to reflect on alongside all the neuralgia.
19066,I am 26yo and I just got shingles. I had blood tests and everything seems very ok with me. They found my kidneys are little worse but that might be now because of the infection. I searched on google and everywhere possible and I have no idea why i got shingles. It kind of worries me because If i do not know why i got it i might get it again in the future. Anyone knows why I might have gotten it?
19070,Shingles  again: Shingles sucks when you don t have cancer. I remember being surprised at how tired I was from a little rash on my face. I m grateful I got vaccinated about a year ago seems to be doing the trick so far fingers crossed it continues.
19071,Young Tech YouTuber Jonathan Morrison updates on his nerve damage shingles vision problems. His tweet about the vaccine If anyone is nervous about the vaccine I Am a couple months in and zero side effects. Tweet aged well: Having seen healthy people suddenly develop rapid blood cancer and other shit out of no where post vaccine I mean listen the pro vaccine shills are the same people still wearing masks in their cars causing traffic accidents.
19077,Shingles vaccine: I had the typical flulike symptoms for about 18 hours. A little fever muscle aches and tiredness. Try to get the vaccine when you have the next day mostly free. The side effects were NOTHING compared to the weird pain of getting a case of shingles. I had a very light cast and it was miserable.
19078,RSVImpfung sterreich: Wir haben die Impfung ohne schlimme Nebenwirkungen berstanden. Am Samstag drfte die Kleine Gliederschmerzen gehabt haben da hat sie viel geweint und wenig geschlafen. Am Sonntag auch noch ein bisschen heute ist alles wieder gut  Oh und sie hatte extrem viel Stuhlgang Mehrere BlowOuts am Samstag Die Menge von Impfstoff wird nach Gewicht verabreicht wir hatten also diesmal einen lngeren Nadelstich  nicht mehr den kurzen Pieks wie bei den frheren Impfungen. Meine Kinderrztin hat mir so eine kleine Pipette mit Zuckerlsung gegeben um das Baby damit abzulenken whrend sie injiziert hat. Hat so semi gut funktioniert  Ich halte euch die Daumen dass es bei euch entspannt abluft 
19081,Any parents get the RSV vaccine for their baby yet? on: he got his at 2 months... he was fine
19082,PSA Vaccinated? Yes you CAN still get shingles: Did you get the shingles vaccine too? Mine was only the size of a 12 dollar and scabbed within a week. I just feel sunburnt in different areas on that side of my body now. I read a study that reported a huge rise in cases of shingles and herpes zoster in Latin American countries with dr s stumped but starting to look at shingles as a delayed activator. Glad you are doing better friend
19085,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: If it makes you feel any better you probably would have got chicken pox at some point and getting it as an adult is even more severe than as a child. Were in the same club friend. I Have had shingles in my fifties then the two dose Shingrex vaccine then a few years later BAM another much smaller and shorter lasting shingles attack. At least my kids will not have to worry about this.
19086,I Am vaccinated and fortunate to say I Am ok. Oct 2022 flu shot. Nov 2022 3rd Covid shot and first shingles shot. Dec 2022 Guillain barre syndrome starts. 3 months to return to work. No more vaccinations
19087,Vulvar shingles at 15dpo: I had a blister rash in the same area as you and I was allergic to the surgery soap. And weird thing is. . It was the same soap used on my gallbladder surgery. I do not remember the rash but the medical papers showed I encountered it back when I was 15 and had my gallbladder removed.
19088,I was forced to get an experimental vaccine that gave me the shingles. Where was my freedom??
19089,I have been diagnosed with shingles and it is been like 3 weeks already it started with right thigh and a week ago it happened to spread on my left thigh been on anti viral for 4 days now but I cannot tell the stage it is been the same for like 2 weeks.... burning effect every now and then and itching... no severe pain or anything. Based on your experience can you please tell me which stage am I? And how long I should expect to last? Thanks for your input
19091,Dr. Peter McCullough A Lethal quotTurbo Cancerquot Appearing Soon After mRNA Vaccination Ask Dr. Drew: warning do not vaccine your pets my dog died after 3 weeks had to put her down after the vaccine she got sudden herat failure it was just normal vaccine evry tear one.plandemic time they are putting something funny in them i feel.... kennedy Jnr won a court case after they found graphene oxide in tylenoli am sure they putting it in all sorts of things even dental knumbing injections i heard.
19095,"Craziest request from a patient/customer: I have been working retail for almost 3 years now and had someone ask while in the drive through ""do you give the shingles shot in drive through?"" (Dead serious) Interested to hear your stories."
19097,My husband felt oogie for almost a week afterwards. I felt a little off for about a day. It hits people differently. The vaccine is harsh but shingles sounds 100x worse.
19100,"Valtrex/Valacyclovir prescribed to hemodialysis patient?: Hi r/askdocs, On Tuesday of this week, my grandmother visited the ER after we noticed that she was getting some sort of blistery rash on her back and side. At the ER, she was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed valacyclovir 1 gram tablets, to be taken three times a day. On Wednesday, she took one tablet before a hemodialysis treatment session. After the session, she took one with lunch and one with dinner. On Thursday, she woke up in a confused state. Her speech was slurred and most of her sentences were incoherent. She could not fully communicate with us. It looked like she was in a lot of pain and was refusing food, drink, and medication. She could not get up, but she could thrash around in bed. We took her back to the ER, where she was later admitted into the hospital. On Friday she normally would have gone through hemodialysis, but the doctor (different than doctor who saw her for shingles) recommended that dialysis not continue since it was already evident that my grandmother was at the end of life. After two nights, she passed last night. My main concern is, when my mother was in the hospital staying with my grandmother, she began to read up a little bit on the internet, probably WebMD, and read something concerning different dosages being prescribed to patients with impaired/no renal function... Something about confusion and incoherent speech as side effects in patients with renal failure. My questions to you guys are: Did the doctor who prescribed her the valacyclovir fuck up? Was he right in prescribing a 83 y/o 54kg 4'8"" female hemodialysis patient 3 grams of valacyclovir a day?"
19101,Like the title... I am 20 F not immunocompromised. Went yesterday for a well visit just a checkup and had to see the NP instead of doctor and showed her a rash on the right side of my torso that had showed up a couple days before. Immediately she diagnosed it as shingles which I did not even think was possible. I have always been vaccinated against the chicken pox and I have never had the virus She put me on antivirals immediatley so I have been on them for about 24 hours and I guess I would say i am on day 5 or 6 of shingles? I did not have any pain previously but I just brushed my hand against the area earlier and definitely felt some pain. The NP said that it will go away in about a week and could get worse before it gets better but she says it should be much more tame since I have had the chickenpox vaccine. Is anyone else dealing with this at a young age and having never had the chickenpox before? I am nervous on what to expect.
19103,"Just diagnosed.......: I didn't realize the course was so extended beyond the obvious symptoms. Thanks - I'll try to read more about it. And yea, isn't it cruel that stress is hard to escape? Take time to take it easy and things back up, which creates more stress, in a feedback loop. Trying to keep things at a reduced but steady pace. Then the sewer clogs up and the car breaks down on the same day :P"
19109,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Hah 72 hours of fatigue let me tell you about my 3.5 months of shingles nerve pain and every other day numbness across my forehead and the so far looking to be permanent damage to my eye not nearly as bad as it could be so believe it or not I am fortunate. Also about 4k in medical expenses due to 2 ER visits and expensive eye meds. I am only 44 and was too young to get the vaccine. I will bawl at my next doctor visit if I am told no. I am not really trying to be an AH by the way. I have heard the vaccine sucks. I am more so saying this so if there are others out there who are hesitant about the vaccine hopefully my story will make them reconsider. Oh yeah 5 weeks away from work because I could not keep my eye open and felt unsafe to drive. And a headache so bad in the beginning I had to get an MRI to rule out something much worse. Lol OK I am done.
19111,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: To be fair I had chicken pox at 6 and then shingles at age 10. 80s kid. Stuff happens. It varies based on vaccine but they overall lower the risk of developing the disease and lowering the severity if contracted. You Can still get shingles even w vaccine. As annoying as having chicken pox and shingles was To me they are not as worrisome as polio for instance. What is her reasoning for not wanting to vaccinate? Id be more upset over the bigger ones. How did she get you through school wo all of The vaccines?
19112,Post shingles skin: Its been 11 months for me. I had a similar outbreak although mine blistered and scabbed. My issue was the skin sensitivity in the front abdomen. Wearing a shirt was hard the first few months. It has slowly but surely gone away over time. I Am still on Gabapentin. But i am down to dosing only 2 times a week. It was a long and hard journey and i honestly thought it might never go away but through time it has slowly gone away. Nerves take a long time to heal.
19115,How many of you with shingles under 50? Did you get the vaccine or planning to?: I had a mild case at 39 last year. I had a few spots pop up on my chest and armpit. I thought my armpit was sore from something I did physically until I took a better look at the little rash and put it together. I would not mind getting the vaccine. I am an easily stressed out person and do not want it again. I wish the information we had access to would be more open about it being all ages who are affected. What is everyone is doctor saying? Are they surprised when they see it in certain age groups?
19116,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: If you get ocular shingles it can permanently damage your eyesight. Shingles is very painful and can in some cases lead to permanent chronic nerve pain. The current shingles vaccine is highly effective like 98 and is expected to confer lifetime immunity. IIRC it is available for 50 and up. The main side effects are a very sore injection site for several days after the two doses administered a couple months apart. Much more tolerable than shingles.
19123,Oh you had shingles. Yes they will make sick and the rash hurts. I Am at the age of the vaccine I have to get it. My mom had it really bad on her face and blinded her left eye. My sister got the vaccine she was sick for 2 days. I do need to get it soon I just need to plan a good

19128,My son turned 3 months yesterday. Weight 14lbs Height 25 Mild rash starting on Fri Nov 22nd starting at hairline and including hairline by ears. Its been progressing over the past few days and today is starting around his neck. Prior to rash starting he scratched his forehead with his fingernails when he became unswaddled one night. No fever Has runnysnotty nose Mild cough Formula fed same formula for past 1.5 months No new soaps detergents etc. Older brother has cold symptoms no fever for past week. We live in a very dry and cold climate. Rash appears very itchy  although as a 3 month old I do not know how much control he has of his armshands. However if his hands are not covered he tries to scratch the area nonstop I mom was diagnosed with shingles a week and a half ago. I Have been on antivirals and kept the area back covered. Currently we do not have a family doctorpediatrician since we moved to a new country and the soonest appointment is for end of January but we can take him to urgent care or ER if needed. He has his 2 month immunizations not immunized for MMRV 1st photo  Wednesday 1120  scratched face 2nd photo  yesterday 3rd photo  today Photos  Thank you
19129,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: Got Shingles earlier this year after my 2nd covid infection and I had suicidal ideations it was so awful. First thing I am going to do when I turn 50 next year is sign up for the vaccine.
19132,Hello everyone Got diagnosed with shingles yesterday at urgent care but red rash started Saturday 1019 and fluidfilled blisters did not appear until Monday 1021. Got started on valacyclovir yesterday and have taken 4 doses so far. Anyway my question is did any of you start feeling ill later after the rash appeared? Just barely got a low fever of 99.8 today and stiffnessflulike symptoms. Everything I Am reading says fever etc typically appears before the rash. Did I catch another bug on top of shingles or is it probably the shingles causing the trouble?
19135,This is so true. The 2nd shot was not nearly as bad as the 1st. I figure if the 1st shot was that bad shingles must be worse.
19139,1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: It very well could just be a bug. I would be surprised if it was COVID as I just dealt with a round of that at the end of February. Could not hurt to take a test though. I will take a test momentarily.
19140,Shingles vaccine: To counter the horror stories I had zero side effects to both shots other than a sore arm for a couple days. Basically it felt like a stronger tetanus shot arm painwise but never felt tired or sick. But even with the rougher side effects it is a multitude better than actually having shingles. My father had it in the early 90s and I will never forget the pain he experienced from it so as soon as I could get the shots I did.
19144,Cervical cancer deaths are plummeting among young YOU.S. women  A research team saw a reduction as high as 60 in mortality a drop that could be attributed to the widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine.: I remember my mom not letting me get the HPV vaccine before I went to college because you are not going to be having sex which led to me having an HPV scare a few years later even though I was practicing abstinence at the time. Thankfully it was one of the weaker strains and went away on its own verified by my OBGYN. I got the vaccine as soon as possible after that.
19145,Bagged Roses? Good or no good: Kim my shingles vac. Did the same to me. I felt crappy the next morning an day. It swelled an was very hot. But glad I got it cuz I remember my dad having shingles an suffering threw it. It was on his back an he did not miss any work but he said wearing that shirt everyday hurt like crazy. Just glad I got my vaccine.
19148,On the morning of my 29th birthday 522 I woke up with an intermittent pain in the left side of my back. Took some aleve which did not help and went about my birthday plans. 523524 the pain was getting worse thought I pulled a muscle. I kept stretching and going about my birthday weekend plans. Finally on 525 I went to urgent care I had one small blister on my back that I thought was a bug bite. The Dr suspected a kidney stone got a CT scan that was clear. Then the rash kept getting worse. Went to my PCP on 529 and they said it looked like shingles but did not think it was because I had the chickenpox vaccine as a baby. Told me it was too late for antivirals anyway and sent me home. Photo is rash day 6. I was not stressed my immune system is fine and I eat pretty healthy. I never had chicken pox that I know of and I just turned 29. I Am so scared of this recurring it was the worst pain I Have ever experienced. I Am on day 10 since first onset of pain and its finally getting better but the rash still is overly sensitive. I had an urgent care doc prescribe me Valtrex finally yesterday not sure if it will do anything at this point. Anyone else have seemingly no trigger for this and from the chickenpox vaccine?
19150,Cabenuva 2: I had to abandon cabenuva because I could not cope with the flu like symptoms for almost a week each time. After a week of sickness I was fine but I began to fear the vaccine because it made me very uncomfortable and sick each time. I guess I am reacting too strong. They were not able to tell me why I react like that and they did not have other patients with these complaints.
19151,Within the past few months I have gone from having my first abnormal pap to the colposcopy and to the LEEP. I have CIN2 16. My colposcopy she took 2 biopsies and only one was positive. I just left my doctor and she said the results from the LEEP showed a new area being CIN12. I will be seeing a specialist on the 23rd to see if we will monitor it with pap smears or do another Colposcopy. I just feel devastated. The second I walked out of the office I just cried. I am only 33 never married single and was hoping to hear I was free and clear of this. I will continue to take my vitamins and getting all 3 of the Gardasil vaccines this is all just heartbreaking news but I will not give up hope of clearing this. My heart goes out to all who are feeling the same as me
19152,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: My MIL also had to go to emergency after shingles shot.
19154,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Week 5 of shingles i do not know why I Am here lol to get insight into my parents brains?. Its fucked me up pretty good. I wish I had the opportunity to get the shots just to avoid this hell all over again.
19156,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: The shot Freaken hurts too. You need two doses.
19159,"Shingles on back, family wants me to wear a bandage despite them being vaccinated: Your post or comment was removed for being off-topic."
19164,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Made that error. Also had a flu shot and RSV shot in the same cocktail. It was a really fun day of being a pile of sweaty goo on the sofa. Worth it to not have all the baddies but next time I will be spreading those jabs out instead.
19169,Shingles vaccine experience: I work in healthcare and believe me you do not want shingles. You are sore arm is a small price to pay for what protection the vaccine does provide us.
19172,RSV vaccine: I got the vaccine and have not had any side effects thus far
19174,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: My mom got shingles 12 yrs ago and still has pain from it get vaccinated
19175,Shingles vaccine: Had both . I have had shingles twice and you do not want to have that.
19177,Shingles vaccine: We got ours right when we turned 50 too. We would had several friends our age get shingles and I did not want to mess with that shit. I did not have any issues with the vaccines. It made my husband feel pretty rotten but he agreed it was better than shingles.
19180,First Time w Shingles really struggling: Ouch I hate this for you At such a young age and where you have it located I do not know how you are able to deal with it. Ask you Dr as you should be able to up the dosage of gabapentin if its not bothering you. Tylenol. Also I took lysine which you can read about. My first 34 days at your stage was a living hell and could not sleep from the pain. After it scabs up and they fall off it left scars but rest assure they will disappear over time. I pray for a speedy recovery from this dereadded virus for you. Once I got over mine I took the shingrex vaccine unfortunately at your young age you may not be able to get it.
19181,Shingles. F'ing shingles.: It might have been the worst week of 5th grade pox shingles period. I remember eating everything in the house and watching tv. Then I had a stomach ache too. At least the shingles were only on my arm. I knew that I would be immune to the pox after but no one could tell me about shingles no Google says you can get it again but its rare. Looking forward to shingles vaccine in 13 months except I hear its painful.
19184,"Increase of over 25% in EMS calls for cardiac arrests associated with the rates of vaccine doses administered, raising concerns regarding vaccine-induced severe cardiovascular side-effects like myocarditis [peer-reviewed article]"
19185,"Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? Doesn't make sense to me......: I got several different opinions from my doctors. I finally spoke with a nurse who had also had shingles. She suggested I have my blood tested to see if it was still active in my system. I went for blood tests every three months. The fifth time I went in it was cleared from my blood. That is when I went for the shingles vaccine. It has been four years now, so far so good no recurrences. I do not ever want to have to deal with shingles again.It was absolutely horrific."
19186,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: Lmmmfaaaoaoo I would get it anyways. I got it when I was 21the pain is nearly unbearable
19187,Same here. All vaccine up with no problems BUT My 2nd shingles shot? Begged to die and get the suffering over with
19188,Vaccine input because I am 50 now: I did not do both but I got shingles on Wednesday. My arm is still a little sore 2 days later and my only real symptoms were to wake up overnight shivering and sweating. Though 2 Tylenol and an extra blanket took care of me. I opted to wait to get COVID and the flu later in the fall
19190,RSV Vaccine: My baby was born last March and we got it done a week after he was born. He had no side effects at all and I was glad he had a bit of protection going into winter.
19192,How are you guys managing sleep? I am in week 4 and the intermittent shootingtype pains are making sleep all but impossible. I am almost 2 weeks in on gabapentin started extremely small dose but now at 1200 mg and have read it takes a while to really kick in. Any other tips or tricks out there that are helping you?
19193,Face tingling and numbness on one side: Agreed sounds like Bells or shingles ETA I i had shingles when I was in my 30s it felt tingly and stuff.
19194,Pros and cons of getting the shingles vaccine?: Wow This was me exactly although I did not get an MRI. I am on my 3rd eye specialist 6 months later. The ice pick pain was the worst type of pain ever experienced in my life and was nonstop for at least 5 days. No amount of meds helped me.
19197,I Have asked everyone I know. Now I have to ask you all. Can you make this sign make sense? Why is this a good slogan to advertise a shingles vaccine?: I had it at 32 and it was one of the craziest things to ever happen to my body. I think it was stress induced
19200,Good luck because I got shingles even though I was vaccinated.
19201,No subsidy for shingles vaccine due to high cost MOH: Yup this was me. No chicken pox because I got the vaccine but still got shingles in my 20s.
19203,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: My first vax was a little rough for a day. I took the next day off and was back at work after that. My second shot was nothing like that. I had no reaction.
19204,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I got shingles twice before I turned 50. And they say you can only get shingles once face with rolling eyes

19208,Has anyone under 60 been able to receive the RSV vaccine?: I was able to get it but not just for asthma. I have other lung conditions on top of asthma that put me at a high risk and I still needed a prescription from my specialist.
19209,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: Mine did not look like that not sure if it depends on the area and mine was around my eye. When my dad had it on his chest it looked more like that though i am not sure what it looked like in the beginning.
19210,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Near tears 'cuz the itching just will not cease
19211,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Oh great something to look forward to. I remember my grandfather getting shingles back in the 90's and this man who was tough as nails said it was the worst pain of his life. Sooo that is something I do not want and since we have the tech to prevent that misery I felt the minor discomfort far outweighs the full blown outbreak. I guess I fell the same way about the COVID19 vaccine also put me down for a day or two
19213,This is what my gynecologist just sent me Unfortunately your pap smear resulted as abnormal High grade abnormal cells. This is a pap smear result that we can see that can mean moderate to severe changes in cervical cells. Most of the time this is related to HPV virus so often that testing is not performed routinely. This is not surprising as 90 of women will be positive for the hpv virus by the time that they are 50. It is spread through intercourse but it does NOT mean infidelity as most women will be exposed with their first sexual experience and the virus stays with you after exposure like the chickenpox virus coming back as shingles. Because we know that hpv can be associated with cervical cancer which is what a pap smear screens for the next recommended step would be a colposcopy a procedure at which we look at your cervix with a microscope and sample or biopsy any abnormal areas to rule out any abnormal pre cancerous or cancerous cells. I have only been with 3 guys sexually in my entire life. I have been in long term relationships with all 3. How the hell is this even possible. All of my papsmears have come back abnormal. I got the Guardasil vaccination when I was 12. Completed both rounds. I am so fucking confused and my partner says he has never had sexual intercourse while we were together and i have no reason not to believe him. My test results for HPV were NEGATIVE. So how the hell is this even possible. Please anything factual or experienced will be so greatly appreciated
19215,Three months into Cosentyx I had a shingle on my groin area. I stopped cosentyx and took shingles med..it went away that was few years ago. It is been few days since I took Taltz and I am starting to feel the same symptoms back...itching redness.....I do not know if I am going to get a full blown shingles by the 2nd shot or not. I am going to talk to my doc but I DONOT want to Stop Taltz....I feel this drug might work. Has anyone taken shingles vaccine while on biologics?
19217,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I never did and sure enough I got the shingles last winter. Was not too bad though. Just red dots all over my torso. I wonder if I do not need the shot now?
19218,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Only two weeks? I estimated 6 weeks for me from start to finish with my worst case. I did have weirdly a couple of minor bouts 30s40s that I did not recognize as shingles until I had a full blown case I Am old so I Have been through the gamut Id had the 50effective vaccine I did not know you could get it more than once which just seems against everything that is fair.
19219,My poor mom got shingles. It was beyond horrible. I would not wish it on anyone. I got my vaccine as soon as I was eligible.
19223,Do Not wait to get the shingles vaccine: I got shingles on my FACE Almost in my eye at 32 and same. THAT SAID speak up advocate for yourself and you can get it but you likely have to pay out of pocket. I was the most aggravatingest squeaky wheel and kept asking for it because there is no way I am going through that hell again also you tend to get shingles in the same spot and I am not playing around to let it go into my brain or blind me make me go deaf like it tried the first time around....I got a new doctor who supported me getting it so I did But yeah unfortunately insurance would not cover it so it was like 200 per shot 2 total. Definitely pricey but the sense of relief was priceless. My sister was able to get shingrix simply based on my experience and her insurance covered it though so I guess it just depends Best of luck YOU matter and you deserve to get the vaccine if you want it Even the CDC explicitly says in the shingrix handout anyone over 50 OR immunocompromised OR has a history of shingles is eligible to get the vaccine
19227,That Is the thing. I was too young for the vaccine and got shingles and it sucked complete ass. However many people do feel very sick and tired after the vaccine sometimes for a couple of days and its wrong to be unprepared for that.
19228,Any recommendations on taking or not taking RSV vaccine considering its possible side effects..?: I had mine at 32 weeks  recommended between 2836 weeks in Aus no side effects except sore arm I had Abrysvo in Aus this is the only recommended for pregnant women. The other one in Aus Arexy has side effect of possible pre term labour ect
19229,If you are unsure about the RSV Vaccine: I got all my shots Felt really good about myself afterwards. Learn to wear a helmet before you fall. That Is what vaccines are to me.
19233,Lucky enough to get not have gotten a rash in one spot: My shingles outbreak oddly enough was a rash on top of an already present rash one that in 2018 my dermatologist told me was shingles and so he said I would not need a shingles shot. Shingles is just weird and seems to do whatever it wants to do. I DO NOT KNOW
19236,Had the second shingles shot: I was miserable for two days. STILL better than shingles.
19241,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I had it when I was 20 my immune system had taken a dive and it sucked soooooo bad
19244,32M 5'11 145 lbs  Hoping to get some thoughts here  About 34 weeks ago woke up with moderate pain in my 2 middle fingers on the left side and wrist. Did not think much of it other than i slept on it wrong as the week progressed the pain got worse and moved up my arm. Mainly effecting the inner part of my elbow but would also wrap around to my lower tricep. A week later i developed a rash pretty much in all the areas that were painful. Some 56 days after this I woke up with an excruciating headache the worst I have ever felt. This was on thanksgiving morning and i had to go to the ER. Numerous doctors thought I had shingles and they tried to do a LP right there but I could not make it through it. They admitted me for the night and the doctors that would come and go did not agree with Shingles. The next morning I had an LP done and they sent me home with a diagnosis of Viral Meningitis. Here are the CSF results Color Colorless Xantho  none Glucose  46 WBC  99 Lymph  89 PMN  3 Negative for HSV1 and HSV2  never had chickenpox They never stated what the arm pain or rash was. It has been almost 2 weeks since I left the hospital and am still experiencing fatigue occasional numbness swelling and inflammation in my hand. The same 2 fingers on my left hand are still quite painful. Over the past 5 days I have also developed a very sensitive sensation in my upper left back and left pectoral. Even as much as moving my arm so my shirt brushes up against these areas feels like a bunch of pinpricks. I have seen my doctor several times since I was in the hospital and honestly I feel kind of like a nut but I have never experienced anything this drawn out without improvement. I should note the rash was never itchy only painful. My doctor does not really know what is going on but they are going to check for Auto Immune disorders via bloodwork. Please help
19246,Shingles vaccine: I was quite sick for about 25 hrs after like a really bad flu. I would do it again without hesitation to avoid shingles which is really a living hell I would say go for it....just maybe book it before a weekend lol
19247,Hi I am just looking for a little advice Ill start from the very beginning this might be a long one. My son was born at the end of September 2023 by Caesarean full term in the UK with no medical reason for caesarean for him other than my safety due to previous labour complications. He was slightly congested as expected with caesarean babies but it cleared rather quickly. At 6 weeks old he developed RSV Bronchiolitis and Croup admitted to hospital twice in the same week and on oxygen and feeding tubes. Ever since having the above conditions he has had permanent nasal congestion and a cough. I took him to be checked over by the GP for his nasal symptoms over 10 times each time being told he was congested due to not passing through the birth canal and each time a different GP and it was not until the 11th visit the GP listened to my concerns and referred my son to the paediatrician his appointment is the 9th April. My daughter 3yo had a virus 2 weeks ago which wiped her out and then me and I am assuming my son also caught it. Now I have spent the past two days with him in hospital with bronchiolitis and croup again sucking in at ribs when breathing etc and of course his nasal congestion has worsened. My three questions are 1. Could it be possible that the first bout of RSV Bronchiolitis and Croup caused his adenoids to become inflamed and not go back to normal size causing the permanent congestion? 2. Is it likely that the RSVBronchiolitis from when he was 6 weeks old has made him more susceptible to catching it again and developing that awful wheeze? 3. Am I able to request a rescue pack of the Dexamethasone given to relieve croup symptoms from my GP to keep at home incase it happens again? Thank you to anyone who has read this far and any advice is appreciated greatly
19248,Shingles Sucks: Shingles is the absolute worst. I thought I had a bug bite and now I have scars like I was splattered by hot grease. I literally did not sleep for three days. Ruined my vacation and I almost went insane.
19255,"Shingles Vaccine: Hello, Has anyone had the Shingles vaccine? I am wondering about any side effects you might have had? Thanks for any help, Nancy"
19258,Hi so I Have recently got a large sort of cluster of rashes and blisters that randomly appeared on my back and progressed throughout 11 days at first it looked like a spider bite but now its much worse the doctor i went to not dermatologist said it was shingles and from all the pictures i have seen online it looks nothing like it. Neither is there any pain just itches like crazyIve also never had chickenpox and i am fully vaccinated. Attached photos show progression thank you.
19259,Shingles vaccine second dose: Second one was worse for me. I got the vaccine after my friends father got shingles in his EYE.
19263,Absolutely NO side effects except a sore arm. Two of my siblings had horrible shingles infections years ago and I was NOT giant through that. The vaccine is safe.
19265,Shingles vaccine?: Agree. Hard golf ball sized knots on arm. The second was the worst
19266,I Am planning to get my first shingles vaccination today: I have been able to balance out my T cells and immune system so the shingles and the side attacks excels stop attacking me so bad. I use daily tagaments with cimetidine it is off label use was for shingles. I use that and I also use glutathione and I also use reishi mushrooms this has created somewhat of a balance for my immune system. For many years they diagnosed me with shingles but after going to Immunology I learned that I actually have a T Cell deficiency with an immunoglobulin G deficiency which means if I go pumping any of those vaccines in me it is probably going to kill me on the spot. You do not know your God given immune system until you do antibody testing. Good luck
19267,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: It is a long story but bottom line conceptually I had a lowintensity never fully dormant run of shingles for almost six years. Went undiagnosed due to underlying disability and I was in a very real sense under the influence of a mind virus. Once I was able to get the full course vaccination... I cannot even describe the levels of paranoia and delusions that disappeared overnight. Even one bout is painful af. Do not risk it.
19268,I got my second dose of the Shingles vaccine yesterday...: I am definitely getting it as soon as possible I have had Bells Palsy twice already which is caused by the same virus. you would think I could get the vaccine early since shingles is almost a certainty at some point but nope.
19271,I F29 was diagnosed with shingles 3 years ago. I have Type 1 diabetes lupus Graves disease and high blood pressure. At first I was getting shingles rashes back to back the longest lasted 4 months. I Have been working with my doctor but in northern Canada it takes weeks to see my doctor. I eventually got both shots of the vaccine and it has helped a bit. I usually get around 5 rashes a year. This is my second rash this month its always been in the same location on my pants line on the right side of my back. Except this rash I feel like its closer to my buttalong my groin area. I Am on day 2 It hurts to have a bowel movement because anytime I push I get incredible stabbing pain. The pain is also radiating into my clitoral area? Its like an achey stabbing pain. I cannot sit down because it hurts so bad. Has anyone had any experience with your shingles rash moving? I do have a doctors appointment next week and we have no urgent careday clinics to go to only an ER and I do not want to go in to the ER. I Am just looking for thoughts I feel like I Am going crazy from shingles pain. Also I take valacyclovir 2 times a day and regular Adviltylenol.
19275,Its a brutal two dose shot but worth it I know someone who got shingles 3x in the SAME EYE and another friend on her EARDRUM. My 96 yo grandmother said shingles was the worst experience of her life lived to 107.5. Get the shot.
19276,Because I knew it was dangerous I did lots of research. I took the shingles zoster vaccine and it because an auto immune disease. Naturally I would not take another after that .
19277,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes and as a 37 year old woman I got shingles and stressed triggered it. It sucked.
19279,My 10 month old received her RSV and flu shots earlier this year. What sort of precautions are you utilizing to help keep your little one healthy? Both out in public and through the holidays with family.
19282,41 and got Shingles: Yeah I got a mild case last year at age 40. I had a rash on my back along my beltline that looked terrible but luckily it did not hurt. I was prescribed medication for it and it healed up in a few weeks. My wife also got it age 40 as well and her case was about the same as mine but she had some pain. It was quite odd.
19286,Just turned 50 and got hit with my first case of Shingles.: Sorry to hear that. I had them about 10 years ago when I was in my forties. Got on antivirals right away and managed to avoid the worst but that first one before I got on antivirals hurt a lot. Hang in there in my case the first shingle before I got on antivirals was the worst. Another that was forming when I went on antivirals was painful but not as bad. Another one formed after I was on antivirals it was small and was more itchy than painful. My favourite part was the doctor telling me they are not contagious but to stay away from pregnant women.
19287,my shoulder is swollen from the shingles shot...: Yeah we do not dare skip the mammograms. I hope yours will not be bad.
19290,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Got in a band from my navel around my side and a little past my spine in a big wide swath. It sucked pretty bad and for quite a few weeks. This was last year so I have nat immunity for another year or so and I will be getting the vaccine. The new one works a lot better so it appears than the old one which was nothing more than a 4x dose of the kid's chicken pox vaccine.
19291,Shingles vaccine: I got mine. No side effects except a mildly sore arm.
19293,When people keep reminding me I need my shingles shots: In midFebruary 2020 I got the worst back pain like I was being stabbed. And I had what looked to be three little insect bites or something on my back along with some bruising. Just three little blisters. They were small enough to fit in a circle the size of a quarter. It hurt so bad I ended up calling the doctor for an appointment to see if I had somehow gotten bit by a brown recluse spider or something crazy. Nope it was shingles and luckily my doctor visit was still within the 72 hour breakout window where meds are still an effective treatment. Years later I still feel discomfort where those three tiny little shingles blisters were sometimes. I cannot imagine the torture and pain that must come with a huge shingles outbreak.
19296,Shingles vaccine: Second dose was worse than the first. Can you check with your local health department to see if they can provide the vaccine cheaper?
19297,This subreddit should be sponsored by shingrix I got my shot thanks to you all.: I have a friend who recently got shingles and he was absolutely miserable. Also my body is fairly sensitive to any drugs or vaccines in general so its not a huge surprise my side effects were a little more than most people.
19299,Yes I got it yesterday. No side effects. Shingles shot kicked my butt last week though?
19300,Shingles Pollkind of: Hello I am very sorry to hear about your news. I am 66F and I got the chicken pox when I was 3 years old. Also I am in my 6th week of my first ever shingles outbreak which wasis extremely severe. And sadly to say the antiviral medication was not given to me in the 72hour window. As I had the agonizing off the charts pain for 2 weeks before the rashes started to appear. And from what I understand if I had received the antiviral in the 72hour window then it would have reduced the amount of time of my outbreak. It is disheartening and makes me sad because now I am more prone to get postherpetic neuralgia.. I do not think I helped with any of your questions specifically because of our age difference and what was done then and now. And it could have been and it is just a thought that your vaccine was one of those things that you will never know what or why. I hope you do not suffer too long and with too much pain. It is not a good time that is for sure. Positive thoughts to you
19305,Shingles vaccine: My 57 y.o. friend went to get the shingles vaccine in October last year and got shingles anyway in December
19308,RSV 6 Week Old  Had Vaccine while pregnant: Hey Just commenting for solidarity. I delivered 1027 and got the vaccine while pregnant. My 2 yr old had RSV the week after Thanksgiving and baby seemed fine so I thought we missed it. She had a cough and some sneezing since Tuesday but she has reflux so she is always sneezing and snuffly. On Thursday night she spiked a fever of 102 so I brought her to the ER since it was 12 am. She was diagnosed with RSV. Today is day 4ish of symptoms. She Is still eating well and having plenty of wet diapers but is definitely coughing and having lots of mucus. Her oxygen hangs out in the low 90s while she is asleep but she is not struggling to breathe. My 2 yr old had it when she was 7 mos old and then again at 15 months old and ended up in the hospital both times. I am terrified of her needing hospitalization. I hope you all are still managing well at home
19309,Aciclovir  Electroceuticals  chasing the viral persistencereactivation theory  more: I have had MECFS since I had EBV in 1989. I was always mild till 2022 when I got Covid and it reactivated HSV2 which I get on my shoulder and knocked me into moderate and I was bed bound for a while. Because of this I can get Valtrex prescribed but I have to pay for it and it costs a fortune  I Am also in the UK. The reason I Am posting this is because my starting symptoms of HSV are v similar to what you experience. I get ulcers in my mouth and on the back of my throat. V painful. Then I get tingling where the rash usually comes and then the rash comes. The interesting thing is that when they test my blood before the rash comes out it does not show the virus has reactivated  it only shows once the rash has broken out. The tests are not sophisticated at the moment for these herpes viruses and they know Covid reactivates them shingles is also a herpes virus. I know there is some research into what herpes viruses are reactivated after Covid there is also some research into whether HHV6 has something to do with MECFS
19313,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Ya I have crohnscolitis and Def Immunocomprimised. I will Def have to talk to my Dr.
19314,Our son received the rsv vaccine at his one month appointment. This morning we had his two month where he received multiple vaccines. One the way home my spouse was looking at the records and put it together that he got rsv again. Sent a message to the doctor and received a call back almost immediately where she apologized said they made a mistake. I am beyond upset as I put a lot of faith in the doctor. Baby is sleeping now but is everything going to be okay? Are they any side effects short term or long term from a mistake like this?
19319,Started five days ago with the worst eye pain and headache of my life with some nausea. Went to ER and was diagnosed with a migraine. Doctor gave me naproxen. Took one tablet and woke up with a small blister on my eyelid. Took another tablet and by 7 pm I had what I thought were hives on my scalp and eye brow. I thought I was having an allergic reaction so my family doctor seen me. Turns out I got the shingles. Currently sitting at the optometrist and it does not seem to be in my cornea. How fucked am I? I think I might of caught it early and started taking the antiviral early. My biggest fear is I have a 16 month old who has not taken the chickenpox vaccine until today. Little dude has been through a lot lately I cannot stand to see him in pain.
19320,Are you 50? Get your shingles vaccine. Studies have shown that people who get a shingles outbreak have a 20 greater chance of developing dementia. Links below.: I have no idea. Luckily I knew exactly what it was so I was put on meds but it was still awful.
19324,"After receiving both the Hepatitis A vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine, I decided to get my second Hepatitis A shot and asked my doctor when I could get the flu shot. She said I could get it immediately, so I went ahead. Dealing with the side effects of both vaccines simultaneously was quite the experience. Here's how it unfolded: Mon: Received vaccinations at 9 a.m. Experienced mild fever and body aches. Tue: Soreness at injection sites. Headache and fatigue throughout the day. Thu: Nausea and diarrhea. Loss of appetite and muscle weakness. Sat: Developed a rash at the injection site. Swelling and redness. Sun: Intense fatigue and joint pain. Difficulty concentrating. Tue: Still feeling fatigued and overall malaise. Limited ability to engage in daily activities. I have my second Pfizer shot scheduled for next month, and I'm curious to see how it will compare to this first round of side effects. ---"
19327,Shingles vaccine experience: The inconvenience and reactions to shingles vaccine are minor compared to the unbearable pain and complications of getting shingles. The vaccine is also 90 effective in preventing shingles. I Am a vaccinating pharmacist. Talk to one of your elders who has had shingles and that should convince you that you can put up with some soreness and flu like symptoms for a few days rather than the months long debilitating effects of shingles.
19328,My work investigating the links between viruses and Alzheimers disease was dismissed for yearsbut now the evidence is building: I have HSV 1. The worst symptom is very painful global n europa thy of unknown origin. I also have g astro pares is and typical HSV genital lesions that flare occasionally. I have cold sores almost constantly in my lips and nose also mild but constant and bothersome eye infection. No medication has helped and no firm diagnosis has been given to me. In my way of thinking it is almost certainly viral in nature and probably 1 of the virus that are notorious for living in nerve tissue EG HSV or varicella.
19329,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Your sister not being vaccine could because real problems in their pregnancies. Some viruses like chicken pox can be devastating for a developing fetus.
19330,41 and got Shingles: I had them at 27 Itchy burning and sometimes now it will be like phantom itchy feeling so I scratch it deep. I am going to be 43 in December
19333,Rinvoq and Shingles: So yes absolutely 2 is the standard but no my rheum did not require the full series because the thinking was at the time that because I was in a very bad flare and the RA was uncontrolled to get shot 1 start the Rinvoq and then a little down the line get shot 2. Unfortunately I got Shingles before I would gotten the 2nd shot. I am in northeast USA for context.
19337,Hi folks I just had my first laparoscopic surgery done yesterday to diagnosis and excise suspected endometriosis. I had the surgery yesterday and the gyno found and excised the endo from a few places all around my pelvis. I truly even with the gas pain and soreness feel 100x better already. It feels like a huge lift off my shoulders to not have the daily pelvic pain that shot down my legs and extreme fatigue. I just wanted to share my story and add some positivity here. I was terrified that they would not find any endo during the surgery because nothing had shown up on my ultrasounds and I Have never had super heavy periods. Since starting my period I Have had super painful cramps that caused me to miss school and call out of work multiple days most months. But I just thought and was told that period pain was just part of being a woman. In September I had extreme pain around my left ovary and eventually that was confirmed to be a complex cyst rupture. The left ovary pain continued for weeks and then I also got the same pain on my right ovary. My gyno at the time kept dismissing my symptoms and complaints of extreme pain and told me just to wait for the next ultrasound in 8 weeks to see if the cysts went away and started me on the Nuvaring to prevent any more ovulations. While still having daily pelvic pain I suddenly got strange nerve pain down my left leg going down to my ankle from my inner thigh. I went to the ER because the shoots of pain got so bad I thought I might fall from standing and there was some risk of a blood clot from the cyst causing the pain. While at the ER a rash appeared at my leg and confirmed that it was shingles. I am 25 and have never had shingles before. It is wild to me that the pelvic pain caused by the endo caused my body so much stress that I got shingles while otherwise completely healthy After the shingles resolved I returned to my gyno one more time because the pelvic pain was still there if not worse and I was having to constantly miss work because of it. The gyno entirely dismissed my symptoms and did not even have an endometriosis specialist she knew of to refer me to after I brought it up. Then I looked up and booked an appointment with an endo specialist in my area. The specialist was amazing and did an ultrasound on me at that very appointment and found that both of my cysts were gone so likely not endometriomas. I was crushed because I thought that meant I probably did not have endo and the pain was just in my head. But luckily the specialist was insistent that I still probably do have endo and suggested that the nuvaring may be making it worse because Id the extra estrogen. The specialist then started me on norethindrone and referred me to a gyno to do the lap since this specialist no longer does them himself. Since the lap my fatigue and pelvic pain have disappeared I guess with the endo they excised. I finally feel like I have my life back and can be excited for my future and especially my wedding next year. I know this is an extremely hard and frustrating disease to deal with but there are some good outcomes.
19338,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: My wife got shingles at age 46. Sadly we cannot get the shot until 50. She went through 3 weeks of pain and tingling. I am pretty sure as soon as I turn 50 side effects be DAMNED I am getting those shots.
19340,I never had chicken pox. In nursing school I had to get the chicken pox vaccine. 6 months later I got shingles. So if you have never had pox but had the pox vaccine you can get shingles.
19341,Developed Shingles immediately after receiving varicella vaccine: NAD but unless you have had blisters that have since healed it does not look like any shingles rashes I have seen all of which had active blisters or healed blisters.
19343,Shingles vaccine: It Freaken hurts the next day.
19344,Shingles vaccine experience: I got mine a couple years ago now. The thing that convinced me was that within about 3 months I saw my mom got her second case of them and my BIL got them. She got them on her back and stomach. She had a bad time with them. He got them on his head and they spread around to his eye. To say he had a bad time with them would be a huge understatement. He still has problems with his eye because of them. I had already been thinking I should do it but the day my vaccine sister called me and told me that I should get the vaccine I called and set it up. The first one just gave me that arm that felt like I would been frogged repeatedly for days. The second one knocked me on my butt for a couple days.
19346,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I am a young millennial and the chickenpox vaccine was available when I was a kid. My mom opted to put me in the bath with my sibling instead so that I would get it. She is always been moderately vaccine ie will accept some vaccines but is skeptical of most and believed that to be the better decision. I almost died. My throat swelled shut and I could barely breathe. It was a really bad case. Even that did not change her vaccine views though. I did not die so that is all that matters to her I guess. I do not blame anyone for the thinking you are describing. I just wish it was not so culturally engrained that it is viewed as a viable alternative even with the availability of the vaccine.
19349,Excruciating pain it feels never ending. Is this normal?: I Am so sorry. Shingles is a nightmare. Did your doctor put you on Gabapentin? It takes awhile to build up but it does help with the pain. Some level of pain lasted for me until about Day 15. Then severe itching set in. You will need a pain pill for the early days of shingles. You will also sleep and sleep and sleep. Ice packs and spray on Aspercream helped me a lot. For the itching my doctor prescribed me Hydroxyzine makes you sleepy but you want to sleep anyways. Shingles is worse than csections and colon surgery. I can vouch for that. Please text if you have any more questions. My heart goes out to you. Prayers.
19352,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles at 34F on my forehead. Was misdiagnosed because I also had a double ear infection. it is the worst pain in my life I nearly ODd on painkillers it was so bad. It was getting better than I got in a fight with my boyfriend and it spread to my eye and I was blind in one eye for about a week. Fortunately it reversed and was not permanent eye damage. I have asked for the vaccine and have been denied. I would strongly advise against getting shingles.
19353,I got the Shingles Vaccine it seemed to help me. I got 1 or 2 outbreaks the first 6 months after I got the vaccine but then I went a whole year without getting another outbreak which has never happened to me since I became infected. That outbreak was also very small pretty much gone in a day.
19354,Hope it works for you I still got shingles after 2 doses of the shingles vaccine
19356,Vaccine after shingles?: I had the vaccine when I was 25 when I first got diagnosed. I had to wait 3 months before getting itto make sure I did not have another flare up. I did not have any issues until this year I Am 36 now. I had a flare up after I was really sick over Christmas this year with RSV for like 6 weeks. Shortly after my shingles popped back up. This round was a lot more manageable. I caught it early and got antivirals started. This was in February and I got my second vaccine in May this year. I have not had any side effects with either shot. They were honest and said it has not been studied in people my age but I was good for over 10 years so I will continue to get the vaccine moving forward.
19357,"Newbie here: Yes, I am 37 and got shingles my first time when I was 22. I've had it 17 times since I was 22 :( I got the vaccine 3.5 years ago and my outbreaks have actually been worse and more frequent since then, no idea why. I have had all the bloodwork under the sun done, immune panels, etc., and there's no ""cause"" for my shingles, it's just what my body has decided to do! Good news is that most people never get shingles in the first place, and those that do almost never get it more than once, so there's hope for you yet! I hope you feel better soon and can kick this and have it be a distant memory :)"
19361,Shingles vaccine experience: Yeah shingles runs in my family so I was not messing with it. Other than a sore arm I had no issues.
19362,shingles with no rash: I Have had shingles 6 times no rash. Also had the vaccination.
19363,Wow. Had shingles once but putting off the vaccine bec I heard it is rough. Always only have fatigue and body aches with vaccines too so now I am apprehensive
19365,Did Not vote for him but since he won: I Am 43. I Have had them twice. Thankfully I only had a really tiny rash both times. I also had really mild chicken pox3 so I think its related. Id still like to get the vaccine 
19367,My Mom just had the Shingles vaccine a year or two ago said the same thing it was one of the only vaccines that I recall her saying I do not know if I can do the second dose about due to side effects She did get dose 2 thankfully
19369,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: I Have never encountered anyone under 50 with the shingles vaccine and I was born before the chickenpox vaccine was a thing. Did get gardasil and I caught a strain of HPV.everyone has it and there is no test for men to see if they have it or not so if you have sex with folks with a penis you will likely get a strain. It comes and goes. HOWEVER there are vaccines for much more important and deadly viruses that you should be concerned about if your mom kept you away from them. Measles mumps rubella polio tetanus etc. these are the vaccines you need.
19371,Did Not vote for him but since he won: A guy I used to work with got shingles in his early 20s. Ended up having nerve damage from it.
19372,Valtreex and Gabapentin?: If you're lucky you could have the rash close up in a couple weeks. If you're unlucky you could have damaged nerves and months of suffering ahead. I wish you GOOD luck
19373,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: This is how it popped up in me when I was 34 I had major surgery ankle reconstruction and the stress on my body from the surgery caused a shingles outbreak. I Have had chickenpox no vaccine. It was a fun few weeks on crutches newly postop in sooooo much pain from both the surgery and the shingles and it was 2020 so no doctors would see me in person so it took forever to get diagnosed correctly with the shingles and prescribed the correct antivirals via telehealth. It was quite an adventure.
19378,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My 32 weeker got the RSV shot in the NICU right before she was discharged at 376. Zero effects on her whatsoever I was so thankful to have gotten it for her especially because she went home in October when RSV was ramping up.
19383,Shingles vaccine: I was sore but that is way better than shingles.
19384,Close friend wants to have a play date even after she told me that her dad who watches her son every week was diagnosed with shingles this week.: I got shingles at one month postpartum I did not actually realize what it was until the blisters had more or less scabbed over because you know one month postpartum so I although I generally avoided touching it just because it hurt I really was not doing anything special in terms of hand washing. Once I realized what it was I freaked out and had to spend the next 10 days worrying about my four week old baby getting chicken pox because it was totally possible that I had touched the rash and then touched him and he would just had his tongue tie clipped so I was literally sticking my fingers in his mouth multiple times a day. He did not get it. Anyway. I think it is completely okay for you to tell the other mom that since her kid is on poxwatch you would prefer to have him come over once that waiting period is over.
19385,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had chicken pox at least twice and i want to say i had it 3 times. Now when i get real stressed out i have a bad shingle flare up all over my arms and legs
19387,I Have always done both. No bad reactions. The one year I did a trifecta covid booster flu and shingles. I begged for the sweet release of death for a few days
19388,I Am on day 12 on shingles. Took valcyclovir for a week as soon as I noticed rash. Almost all the blisters have scabbed and the scabs are falling off. The pain is persistent despite clearing the rash. I just started the gabapentin today. How long did it take for the gabapentin to kick in for you? If I Am completely still the pain is manageable but any movement of fabric on my skin is awful.
19390,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: shingles in my early 40 s on my face by my left eye scarr red
19392,Tip Waterpokken vaccin: Wij hebben het gedaan en ons zoontje had echt het minste klachten van alle vaccins. Misschien was hij ook inmiddels een vaccin veteraan . Ach ja het is echt een luxe vaccin voor ouders. Wij hebben t gedaan maar uiteindelijk niet een mega big deal.
19394,shingles???: I had both doses of the Shingles vaccineShingrix and STILL got shingles. I Am taking Rinvoq.
19397,Shingles vaccine experience: Had shingles in Sept 2024.....I vomited from the pain......give me a sore arm from a vaccine any day.
19398,This is FICTION not fact: Got shingles when I was 24. Left me with permanent nerve damage ten years later. I really wish they would lower the age for the vaccine. I do not want another flare up it was the worst
19399,Gen Xers we have all gotten our shingles vaccination right?: I have had the shots. I had shingles once before following surgery and do not want a repeat of that
19400,Shingles vaccine: I had worse mild reactions from the flu shot than from both singles vaccinations. Having said that I know two people who got shingles and that shit seems horrible.
19401,PSA Beyfortus: Love that we live in a world where such protections are available Very grateful we were able to get the vaccine for our three month old. We do all we can to protect ourselves and those around us
19406,Its scary how often this baby is sick. Did they ever get him vaccinated??? I remember shortly after they first had him they did not even knowtake the time to educate themselves on RSV season. So so scary: My grandson is vaccinated and he still gets everything from his daycare. RSV Covid flu colds. Poor guy has had a rough 1.5 years
19407,Its shingles from Covid vaccine Good luck 6 vaccine
19411,Getting my first Shingles shot today: I did that too. I was miserable I Am so glad its out of the way.
19415,Low WBC  the entire world is lava.: I know how scary it is . I finished chemo went in for my checkup the following week and the nurse took one look at me had me sit down took my vitals and then told me I was getting transferred to the ER which scared me for 2 reasons 1. I had sepsis and 2. the pandemic was at its height in May 2021. I just thought that I was hot from a lot of walking but when the nurse showed my resting heart rate fluctuating between 145 and 170 I started to believe that I was not ok. Thankfully they had a private room in the ER to keep me safe until I was transferred upstairs. I stayed in for a week and was given the vaccine before I left. And all sorts of bad shit has occurred since then shingles anaphylaxis and loss of hand use. Right now I am awaiting my 2nd hand operation to fix what letrozole did to me. Talk to your doctor if you have or ever had arthritis before you take letrozole. Most people do not have a horrible time on letrozole but if you have arthritis in your history tell your oncologist. My oncologist said that he never would have put me on it if he would known about my arthritis which went into remission 30 yrs ago started a teeny bit to erupt on tamoxifen and went full metal jacket on my body after letrozole. And because it went into remission during my 20s back before electronic medical files it did not show up for my oncologist. I hope that things get better and better for you. C'est la vie et le sol est en lave.
19417,If you recognize all 10 of these vehicles its time for you to get a Shingles vaccination: . And I got chicken pox for the 1st time in my mid 30s. Thought I was going to die and still have scars from a couple of skin growths. Good times
19418,Evidence mounts that shingles vaccines protect against dementia My mother suffered from Parkinsons related dementia. Trust you want no part of that. Confused angry paranoid cruel and suffering hallucinations. Get your shingles vaccine ProudBlue
19420,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I had the same situation exactly and got shingles.
19426,Shingles vaccine experience: i had a very mild case of shingles randomly in my mid 30s when i was backpacking in guatemala and it was fucking excruciating. nerve pain is next level. i wanted weed so bad i did not even know about capsaicin roll on it sounds relieving thinking about it even now lol
19431,20 F with shingles even though I was vaccinated and have never had chickenpox: Hey girl 21 F who is in the same boat as you lol vaccinated and never had chicken pox. I was diagnosed like 2 months ago but my rash was contained along my left arm. It will 100 get worse before better which sucks. But once the rash scabs over there should not be anymore spreading. The nerve pain is what you got to look out for. It will continue for a while mine took like 7 weeks to relax but even then I still felt weak. Take over the counter pain relief Tylenol which is what I used ibuprofen Advil. Also avoid hot compresses or showers it feels great when its happening lol but it makes the rash worse which is what I read and experienced. An ice pack is also helpful. Sorry if this is all over the place haha. Hope you feel better
19436,"3rd bout with Shingles on my face since March: 37 Female 5'2 190 white no smoking ably drink socially medication of addersll, Paxil, anti viral, antibiotic cream. official diagnosed history of anxiety,Depression, ADHD, Rosacea, keritosis polaris, colitis, migraines to the point I take a monthly shot. 8-10 infection a year between, ear, sinus, and respiratory. Every other year for the past 5 years some kind of major infection including optical ulcer, bacterial infection, and a bout of major hard large hives from mosquito bite. Undiagnosed swelling of hands and feet. Tingling in hands. Joint pain and major fatigue that just hits randomly and I literally had in the bathroom or my car for an hour because it hurts to even try to keep my eyes open. Over the past few years I feel like something is wrong but because my anxiety and depression issue NO one took me seriously. Now I have had major shingles 3 times on my face and this time a bacterial infection on top of it. I was referred to an allergist who just pulled a bunch of blood test but wouldn't say if he thought there was an underlying issue or not. Any ideas if there could be and what it is? Also any questions or text I should specifically ask?"
19439,Shingles vaccine: I had shingles in y 30s got the vaccine a few years ago. Trust me shingles is worse.
19440,Is the antiviral a MUST?: 38M here. Had shingles in March. It kicked my ass. I also think mine was stressinduced. As my doctor explained to me it is really important with how your body fights it. The cream and gabapentin were really more for dealing with the symptoms and excruciating nerve pain on the rashes but the antivirals he was insistent on me fully completing especially since I caught it in a 48hour window prior to taking it. Still have some scars from it. Hope they go away someday. Shingles sucks but just be patient with it.
19441,Has anyone her gotten the shingles vaccine before?: Get the vaccine You DO NOT want shingles. I Am not of the age yet but have had a family member get it several years ago back when they actually provided real pain management. She had a lot of fibromyalgia like symptoms and was completely miserable even with pain meds. Now days I Have read of people in so much pain from the outbreak with no adequate pain management and desperately seeking advice for any possible relief. I Am in my late 40s and I can vividly remember getting the chicken pox when I was little and they had the pox parties. I was like 5 or 6 and my mom made me take the oatmeal baths. Crazy how much detail I can recall I Am getting the Shingles vaccine on my 50th BD
19443,"How bad are the side effects from the shingles vaccine?: I was pretty sick the next day, but it didn't last too long. The second was the worst"
19445,Big Day: both my sisters in laws have each had pretty mild shingles symptoms years after the shingrex shots the key here is MILD
19446,Hello my 58yearold mother approximately 51 and 100105 lbs returned from a vacation and noticed a large patch of fluidfilled blisters on her lower back just above her buttocks on December 18. The blisters were consistent with shingles. No more blisters have appeared and the rash is now crusting with just a few left about to dry up. However she experiences nerve pains in her left leg and groin area either when she wakes up or during sleep. Due to financial constraints we could not start antivirals during the active stage. She has been taking the following to manage it Vitamin C with Zinc 500 mg10 mg Started December 18 twice daily Immunomax Pro 30 mg Started December 18 twice daily Gabapentin 100 mg morning noon and night Started December 21 Super B Vitamin B Complex 100 mg thiamine 5 mg pyridoxine 50 mcg cyanocobalamin Started December 30 once daily She is eating pooping and peeing normally in the bathroom when the pain is not attacking. When the pain in her groin area flares up she uses a makeshift bedpan while lying on the top bunk of our doubledeck. Despite these challenges her most active day was on December 31 when she went outside with us to the living room and streets to see the fireworks. This was the first time she saw other people as we have been isolated due to the condition. No more blisters appeared and most of the rash had already crusted by that time. Yesterday she started feeling pain again particularly in the groin and leg area which has made it harder for her to get around. Given her ongoing symptoms and limited resources were seeking advice on the pain attacks she is experiencing so she can sleep and rest. Additionally and RESPECTFULLY are there any health providers in this sub who are based in the Philippines and offer video consultations? Were hoping for a consultation where they can assess her condition remotely especially since she prefers staying at home and avoiding hospital visits due to financial concerns. I am expecting to have around PhP800 from a graphic design project next week for her consultation if possible. I can provide photos from the first day and one from yesterday if it would help. I also want to acknowledge that we deeply and sincerely respect doctors and healthcare professionals. We understand the importance of getting the right treatment but our financial situation made it challenging for us to proceed as we would have liked. We did our best with the resources available to us. I apologize if anything in this post came off as offensive I Am sorry po our intention was never to disrespect your profession. Thank you for your understanding.
19447,I believe we could stop your shingles outbreaks and much more. But the Bells Palsy off the shot was the liver panicking and reactivating a form of herpes because it needed to put it somewhere. The same thing is happening with estrogen dominance from the radioactive metals
19450,Shingrix effects dose spacing question?: I had on my groin taint anus cheek... it was pressing on my nerve and limiting urination too. Are people brave who get vaccines to stop meqsles mumps rebella hep b hpv and malaria etc? No. It saves lives. Peer reviewed science works.
19452,I Am glad I found this group. Been having severe back pain for a week followed by the rash about 4 days later. Now I feel chest pain fatigue body aches and just feel overall crappy. Doc prescribed valacyclovir for about a week to help out Does anyone have an idea if it helps clear any of the above up and if so when? Thanks all
19453,Mom ruined my life by not letting me get the hpv vaccine: Mine was not bad. I had all 3 shots and it was uncomfortable but not as bad as an antibiotic shot. I got the flu shot at the same time as the first dose of the guardisil and the flu shot was worse.
19455,I was cursed with shingles for the 1st time ever back in May of this year. It was a long recovery road in regards to pain management and scar healing. Seven months later there are still areas on my skin where you can see faint traces of the rashes locations left side of my chest neck and upper back. And every once in a while a little red dotbump will resurface in the same areas but it is usually just one. Mistook it for a pimple or broken capillaries from scratching too hard but thinking they might be a chicken pox dot. Anyway other than that I do not think of shingles and have moved on. The only exception is when I feel any type of body ache. I had a terrible neck pain almost like I slept wrong a few days prior to the rash appearing. Well the other night I slept wrong so my neck was hurting and I freaked the hell out Swallowed LLysine B12 and Vitamin D supplements with a Kombucha chaser like I was dying. Thankfully so far things are good. Knock on wood. But I am curious anyone else have relapse fears? And if not how do you cope? I do not want to live the rest of my life as a shingles hypochondriac. Need some much needed advice. Thanks
19456,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: 20 years ago when he was in his late 30s my BIL got the shingles 3 times that decade and was HORRIBLE each time. Two of my good friends had it twice and one of them is just getting over the 3rd time. I Am allergic to most vaccines these days so I just have to hope I do not get stuff.
19457,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Ooof. Not looking forward to it. But I had shingles at 48. Fucking pure misery. For weeks.
19460,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: I had the same problem long time ago. My doctor was prescribing me with an Aldara cream. The cream worked miracles and the content is in small sachets. 1 sachet per use. However the problem was coming back over time and the doctor removed them surgically. After this I received Gardasil 9 and had never got them back again. Ever. If you noticed they are shrinking and fading away also if you notice the colour is opaque and whiter it is a sign that they are dying off. However alternatively you can ask for Aldara cream which will make the process faster. I hope I helped.
19461,First off I am not sure if I should be posting this in rshingles but I will give it a try. I am 65 yo. Yesterday I received my 2nd shingles shot. This was a couple hours after I finished a 30 mile bike ride. Now that it is a day after the shot I feel great. My understanding is and my wife's experience is that the shot can be a challenge to recover from. Like I said I feel great. Is it possible that the bike ride helped me out? I also used medical marijuana yesterday so I am wondering if that could have been a factor. Or is this just how my body setup?
19464,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I have known three people over the years that have developed them. All described it as agony with pain meds and long absence from work. I got my first shot 10 days after being eligible. Homey do not play that game.
19466,Hello. I just finished anal warts removal and had my first shot of HPV Vaccine. My doctor told me that besides warts i had anal fistula daw. Now I Am worried. Question for now is 1. What is my best option to treat this? 2. Any clinic or doctor recos near QC? Estimated Prices will be aprreciated 3. Is it safe to have anal intercourse while I have fistula?
19469,RSV Vaccine: I do not remember exactly when I got my RSV vaccine but it was either 4 or 5 weeks ago I Am 35 weeks now and have 0 signs of labor and did not at the time. I felt 0 symptoms after the vaccine other than a slightly sore arm In total I got RSV flu TDAP and hep b. No symptoms for any of them ETA I Am a first time mom
19471,How did Fibro begin for you?: It began with a hiss and roar 90 hours after I had the covid vax. I woke up and every joint felt like it had glass in it and every muacle felt like I'd run a marathon without any training.
19474,I am 58 and trying to figure out if the vaginal estradiol I use once a week and the pills I take twice a week are enough to trigger herpes simplex outbreak. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge about this? I am now breaking out once a month with tiny blisters in an arc shape on my butt. They are not painful what is painful is the postherpetic neuralgia it lingers for weeks. Long been told this was shingleszoster but a recent pcr swab is positive for hsv2. Asking my partner he says I have had this for years but not like this constant reoccurring. This just sucks and I am thinking I will quit the estradiol and see if the break outs stop.
19481,Shingles vaccine: Felt crummy the day after but that is nothing compared to what I have heard shingles is like. Just needed some extra rest.
19483,"Pneumonia vax: Has anyone else gotten the pneumonia vaccine recently? I'm due for it but nervous about potential side effects. (I'm 60) ****UPDATE**** I'm exactly one week post-vax and on day 2, I experienced some fatigue and muscle aches. By day 5, I noticed a mild rash on my arm. Today, I'm feeling a bit under the weather with a sore throat. But overall, not too bad and definitely worth it for the protection! ?? ---"
19485,Got my second shingles shot yesterday afternoon.: It is the same feeling for the injection itself but sometimes people feel ill a few hours after the shingles shot.
19487,Shingles vaccine: And the exhaustion. My case was light as well but I was physically drained for 6 weeks. It was miserable. Get the vaccine folks
19490,Need for Vaccine AFTER you have had it??? does not make sense to me......: I have had shingles 3 times. The younger you are when you first have it the more likely you are to get it multiple times. I had it at age 4 age 24 and age 29. I never want it again. My insurance would not pay for the vaccine because I was not 50 yet until I went on an immunosuppressant for 2 autoimmune conditions that were likely triggered by the last bout of shingles. I gladly took the vaccines as soon as I could. Take it from someone who is now permanently altered due to shingles.
19493,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: I had it twice in the last 3 years it hurts like hell. Shooting pains under the skin I could not work I was 43 and again at 44. They will not give me the shot until I have not had any symptoms for at least a year
19497,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: My husband has been fighting the side affects of shingles for a year now. It attacks the nerves. His shoulder is a mess and is now in physical therapy. He had shingles when he was a teen. Get your shingles vaccine
19499,Shingles vaccine: Get it. I have gotten practically every vaccine ever made and the only side effects were maybe a sore arm.
19500,Second Shingles Shot: Yeah I had heard the second shot could be brutal but I coasted through mine. Relief.
19502,Shingles vaccine: I had the vaccine Nothing but a sore arm. Had the shots 2 weeks apart. Glad I did that
19504,Got my Shingles vaccine: I had a coworker whose husband got it on his eye. His vision is okay but it was torture.
19507,Sorry if this is long this is all new to me. I am 33F. Saturday night I went to bed with a slight head ache like if you sneeze or bend over there is a bit of pain. Sunday I woke up with it feeling a bit worst took an Acetaminophen and went on my way. I should note that headaches are unusual for me. Sunday afternoon its creeping back so I switch to Tyenol. By Sunday night it feels like a migraine which I have never had. Intense pain throughout the head and if I roll over or cough the pain explodes. Sensitivity to light and sound. Neither aceibu are cutting it. I go to a walk in on Monday cannot see my usual doctor and she gives me Sumatritan. I take one dose and then another 2 hours later to no effect. Still in near constant pain and it seems to shift over my head down my neck bulging behind my eyes and ears. Tuesday morning the pain is so bad I throw up. At this point I go to Urgent Care. I have to wear sunglasses and my ear buds the whole time. They give me fluids and injectable pain and anti nausea. I go home feeling okay but after my nap I want to die. I vomit 2 more times I cannot keep anything down. I managed to sleep until about 1pm on Wednesday with no real change. I have not eaten much of anything in days. It is Wednesday afternoon I notice the rash. I cannot get in touch with my doctor so I text my pharmacist a picture of the rash. He says it sure looks like shingles. My doctor finally calls me and I also text him the picture and he says the same thing. My bf picks up anti virals and T3s for me. He says stop the Sumatriptan. I get a bit of relief but end up throwing up my gravol to keep my pain meds down. That night I have a wild sleep the same song keeps playing in my head there is multiple conversations happening and all this chatter chatter. I feel like I was going crazy until I read similar experiences on this subreddit bless. I vomit a total of 4 times. I wake up around 530 and take my doses of anti virals and pain relief and feel okay. I finally go see my doctor who confirms the rash is shingles. I tell him I cannot tolerate this migraine pain. I describe it for him and he seems to think it is cluster headaches and would be the trigger for the shingles. I started prednisone this afternoon and it is been like a break through. I managed to eat and could actually watch a bit of TV with my bf. With sunglasses and ear plugs because it is too loud and bright. So I feel like my symptoms are sort of all over the place but the fact that I seem to respond well to the pred makes me lean towards CH. Can this be a one off thing or is it like well buckle in kiddo you are one of us now? Any perspective is helpful.
19520,Oh girl you will shingles vac alone knocked me for a loop
19521,MJ has changed my life in 1 week: I felt it increasingly slightly towards the end of week. Friday the day before injection was the worst but it was still manageable. I turned out to be sorry for the TMI premenstrual which probably did not help. But everything has gone quiet again post injection. Such a relief
19523,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My brother got it at 17 from me I was 8 and it was a real bad time.
19524,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: It is a big deal. Later in life she could develop shingles which are quite painful and the pain does not seem to go ever go away completely. I got shingles in 2006 the constant pain lasted for years. After that it returned after periods of exertion. As I am typing this I am in my bathrobe in my recliner and have not had my morning coffee. I can definitely feel the site of my outbreak. It is not painful kind of a vague itch and annoying. The outbreak is most common on the lower torso in the general area of your kidneys. Shingle is a corruption of the Latin word for waist. My wife got it on her head and now has a permanent colicky. If you get it on your nose it can travel up a certain nerve and because blindness. There is a vaccine for chicken pox for children now as well as one for shingles but you need to be at least 50 to get it. Chicken pox parties are weaponsgrade dumbassery
19525,PSA if You are over 50 Get that shingles vaccine now: I never got the chicken pox. I went to my doctor for a weird rash. He insisted it was shingles. I told him it cannot be since I never got the pox. Refused to believe. Guess what. It was not shingles but they made me get a vaccine for that and chicken pox. I then asked what was the rash then? Yeah we do not know. We did not really test anything else.
19527,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: It is been around for like 30 years now. I got the chickenpox vaccine in the 90s when it came out Edit in the US. I saw it was not readily available in other places like the UK etc.
19529,Lmao I had to share this with someone its currently Christmas I Am not even 30 I Am in my m3 year and I just got diagnosed with shingles I Have always considered myself a pretty healthy person but I just finished my surgery rotation which stressed me out more than I Have ever been stressed out before Anyways merry Christmas you all do not stress too much about medical school I guess or you will fuck your immune system up and reactivate your VZV virus
19533,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: 1966 and I had such a serious break out I was almost hospitalized. It was in my throat. In 1994 my daughter broke out with them on an international flight from Germany to the States so my mom had to deal with that. 1997 my son got vaccinated and three days was actually hospitalized because his incidental outbreak was screwing with his lungs.
19535,Shingles vac: I got the shingles vaccine in 2020 before I started X el jan z per my GI and rheum a to logi st s recommendation. It was easy and pretty painless I had no side effects beyond a slightly sore arm the day of. I did have to call my insurance to ensure that they d cover it and I had to receive the vaccine from my PCP I am in my 20 s. My insurance covered it fully since it was considered medically necessary.
19536,AN and Trigger warning This chapter will introduce an argument on the nature of Yah'Weh that will be one of the important sub threads of this story. One which will be returned to periodically and will be expanded upon later as they reach the surface. In an effort to be fair and acknowledging that there is much we do not know and must take on faith to be a believer of any stripe I will attempt to steelman all included arguments to the best of my ability throughout my work through the voices of my characters. No matter what one believes unraveling the Gordian knot of God and godkings in our global mythosphere is probably one of the single most important unanswered questions of our time. This one topic in particular is one that I have been keenly interested in solving. To accomplish this I have introduced voices of believers and atheists alike into the narrative that will clash and culminate in an increasingly high stress and data poor environment otherwise known as the fog of war as our heroes do their best to make the choices that will seem right in the moment yet will have severe consequences they cannot possibly yet grasp. Without further ado I present CHAPTER 27 EMERGENCE DATE APRIL 25th 7 A.YOU. AFTER UNIFICATION LOCATION SOL SYSTEM ABOARD AAV CONTACT ONE LIEUTENANT PAUL KARST Fuck... I cannot wait until this is over with. Pauls entire world had become agony which made it damn near impossible to maintain focus. Thus he sat eyes closed teeth clenched and focused his will toward the control of his breathing while he waited for this latest wave to pass. Paul. Lor IxAlderos had told him the pain would be superficial and short lived. The fucking liar. Everything hurt but the worst of it was in his bones which felt like someone had cracked them open and poured molten lead into them. No amount of massaging or pain killers seemed to help the pain in deep in his muscles when that flared up either. Paul are you listening? Shit what did I miss? He released the tight fist he had not realized he would been holding. Yes Henry I heard you. Kind Of distracted by the feeling of liquid fire boiling its way through my bones. Paul replied with a hiss. Your initial augmentation pains will be at their most intense over the first fortyeight of your hours. Right now you are feeling the first steps of integration it should pass soon to a duller ache before fading away altogether. A portion of the marrow in your largest bones is right now being replaced by nanomachine factories sensors hormone and drug production centers for your biomedical suite and more. Surely you did not think this would be a painless process did you? Roh Thaadat replied. I was informed this might be painful but this is well above expectations. At least I am here rather than laid up in bed like Jenkins. Paul replied admittedly rather grumpily. I almost rather you would stayed in bed to recover if you are not going to be present in the conversation. Henry said with his arms folded. Just wait until its your turn Cap. Half of the pain in my bones can be directly linked to the multiple biofactories being installed. The very same ones required for functional immortality. Its no walk in the park and you know I Am not normally one to complain. Paul replied taking none of his shit. Sure thing Paul. Whatever you say. Henry replied barely containing the smug. Fuckers enjoying this. At least the pain is subsiding for the moment. Maybe I can focus better on the topic at hand now. With a supreme effort of will he rallied himself to form a reply. Right so back on topic. Paul said. We have been reviewing battle plans for days. I have thought a lot about it the past few days and it makes the most sense to me to begin by breaking the bronze supply chain. This will weaken all of our enemies at once and will provide leverage at the same time. The best way to do so is to land our forces on Cyprus where most of the region's copper is mined. The primary sources of tin are from the mountains of central Asia near Afghanistan and to a lesser degree from maritime trade from the Cornish coast. We can use bombs and landslides to close the mountain passes used to run tin overland into Mesopotamia. The Cornish supply lines can be cut or can be taken over by controlling the other intermediary island stopovers like Sardinia and Malta. From there we can take Victors Idea to offer the secrets of steel steam and electricity along with the truth of their alien occupiers' identities to bribe kings and tribal leaders alike to our because. Every single one of these empires has smaller enemies we can use that to our advantage. Thank you Paul much better. That sounds like a good place to start and a secure enough place to make camp with our forces. By basing ourselves on Cyprus the sea will be our shield and we can use high altitude drone flights for advanced warning of any potential troop and naval buildups by any of the major powers. Henry admitted. But then that begs the question which of the major powers should we topple first? The Mycenaeans have most of their forces tied up in their war on Troy so they would be a good choice but the Olympian pantheon also has the most active godking war bodies to kill. I actually think for that reason we should avoid batting that hornets nest for as long as we can. The Hittites have the most territorial rivals to contend with within Anatolia so we can keep them tied up by strengthening their enemies in secret. We can do the same by allying with the Nubians and the Libyans to distract the Egyptians. That way we can focus on liberating Canaan and the Levant before making our way inland to then challenge Assyria and Babylonia first. Victor chimed in. Makes sense much of Canaan and the Levant are individual city states that have been traded back and forth as imperial pawns since at least the time of Sargon. I daresay many of them would welcome us as liberators should we play our cards right. Paul said finding little to argue with in Victors logic. There you go again you cannot make those kinds of assumptions Paul There is countless examples in military history where people thought they could waltz right in as heroes just to wind up with an insurgency on their hands. This is going to be a problem for us mark my words. Lance replied arms folded. Also which of the godkings runs the show on Cyprus anyway? I believe she calls herself Aphrodite her city is on the islands west coast. Our intelligence shows she is away from her city often sometimes for months at a time. The other major city on the island is in the south and is part of Ba'al Haddads territory though he also travels frequently between Ugarit and Ba'albek on the mainland. Cutting the maritime trade route through to the Cornish coast will certainly draw Ba'als ire as well since that trade route is his domain. If you truly plan to take Cyprus first it will draw the attention of the Olympian pantheon and the survivors of the Titanic pantheons at the same time. Are you sure this is the wisest course of action? Roh Thaadat replied. We will not be able to operate for long on the surface without pissing off some pantheon or another. If we land and make camp on the mainland then they can raise armies for a land invasion easily and kill us with sheer numbers unless we massacre them with advanced weapons. Clearly that will not win us any friends among the locals. No we will be better protected by the ocean as we gain in strength to the point that we can begin to challenge the mainland directly and on our terms. Plus if and this is a big if we can trust our mythology Aphrodite is not exactly popular amongst the Olympians at the moment and Ba'al is a tyrant who demands firstborn child sacrifices so he will not likely be popular with his subjects either. Such rule by fear will make it easy for us to win his people to our side once we kill him. Cyprus is truly our best bet. Paul replied firmly. I actually agree with the spook here. Henry replied much to Pauls shock. Plus Aphrodite is the goddess of love not war right? Like you said she is also gone most of the year if we take her city I suspect she will simply abandon it rather than be successful in raising a fleet to retake it especially with the Mycenaean armies and ships tied up in Troy. Ba'al as I remember from the bible is supposed to be a badass but hell also need to raise an entire maritime invasion force which we will be able to see the evidence of well in advance. Wooden ships can be destroyed from the air easily. If Ba'al wants to dislodge us he will have to fly over personally to do so. We will be ready for him. I would not recommend underestimating Aphrodite according to the myths she is sleeping with Ares the god of war and she still has plenty of influence amongst the stronger Olympians. She very well might be plenty capable of being a major thorn in our side. Reading between the lines we can infer she may also have some kind of ability to affect your mind to make you fall in love with her. We do not know the extent of her powers she could easily have broader mind control powers than just that. Plus we do not know what her war body is like or even if she has one. If its true that most of the godkings have both a war body and a ritual body they have to store them somewhere. We also do not know if both bodies can operate simultaneously or if they need to transfer consciousness or even how difficult that is to do. Could be that killing one is good enough or killing one might automatically revive the other. What if her war body turns out to be Ishtar? We may be in much more trouble with her than you seem to think. Victor said. I Am with the big guy never underestimate the power of a woman much less an angry one. Ba'al may or may not be popular with his subjects there is a lot of contention about if those child sacrifices ever even happened or if they were invented as part of a Roman smear campaign against the Phoenicians. We might be able to easily separate Ba'al from his flock but something tells me that Aphrodites subjects will probably love her. That will be trouble for us even if she herself physically is not much of a threat. We should assume that taking her city will lead to an insurgency at the very least. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned after all amirite? Lucas replied causing the room to go quiet in contemplation. We really have an impossible task ahead of us do not we? Lance asked. I would not say impossible. Humanity clearly found a way to kill them all off during and after the time of the bronze age collapse in our own timeline even if the specifics of how are unclear. The evidence would have been lost during the century or so long dark age that followed but its pretty clear that there were few if any godkings left by the time the world emerged into the iron age. By the time of the Roman empire the gods were clearly dead and religion was all about stone idols powerful priesthoods and plagiarized mythologies. I had thought it merely interesting before that our earliest records were written like the gods were flesh and blood beings ordering things to be done but by the time of the iron age it was all about kings doing as they pleased with the approval of the gods. That subtlety implies they were now operating under their own orders and making their own decisions as if the gods had gone silent. It also makes sense as to why polytheism effectively died out with the rise of syncretic mystery religions and monotheism all accelerating out from our current spot in the timeline. Zoroastrianism Mithraism Judaism all of them originally acknowledged the existence of other gods yet claimed to be the religion of the one true god revealing themselves. It would not be that hard to imagine a few scattered surviving god kings to emerge from this time period and make the transition in thinking from I Am the only god left to I am the only god period. Victor replied. Victor Be careful with that line of reasoning you are treading into heretical territory there. Lance growled folding his arms. You know I are not been a believer for a long time Lance. I respect your beliefs but that do not mean I have to shackle myself to dogma and blind myself to the truth. Victor shot back. Just because we were deceived and conquered by aliens in prehistory in this timeline does not mean the bible is false If anything it helps reinforce certain parts of it. Lance replied. Yeah? Well we still have texts old enough to implicate YahWeh of Elephantine Egypt in towing the pantheon line until he chooses to leave with his people into the lands of Canaan to commit genocide until they secure their promised land. Your beliefs do not seem to be able to explain half the shit we have been hearing while mine do. Victor replied smugly. Not this again You Are twisting the timeline to fit your narrative. There are no good early bronze age attestations of this YahWeh of Elephantine and you know it This is all iron age stuff you are talking about. I retain my position that your point proves nothing but the existence of a breakaway sect of Hebrews that were rewarded with some limited freedoms in that city. Lance shot back. They had their own temple they worshiped Yah'Weh alongside other local gods and they have copies of biblical texts from there that are older than the oldest surviving bibles. That is all proven true and the archaeology is far from settled in that region. I guarantee you we will find something truly damning sooner or later that will point to an earlier tradition. Hell we have a perfect opportunity now to see who is right do not we? Remember again what was the name given to the human hybrid children of the fallen angels in the bible? Victor shot back. The Nephilim. Lance said drily. Sounds an awful lot like the Nephaeliim do not it? Tricky bit of misinformation to call them fallen angels that rebelled against God by making hybrid giant babies with human women in the days before the flood. The Sumerians were closer to the truth when they described them as flesh and blood beings coming from the sky to the Earth and splicing their genes together with the prehumans of Africa. Tiny coincidence there one that reeks of propaganda intended to hide early contact behind myth and eventually religion. We know they are not fallen angels we know the truth its staring us right in the damn face that they were aliens all along. In my mind that truth makes YahWeh just another one of them Victor replied pushing back hard on the topic. It also makes sense that God would push back against such an occupation and assist with their overthrow before preparing the world for his glory. Its easier to teach in parable when communicating complex topics to the uninformed and ignorant and thus its ultimately irrelevant what sort of story he told about the origins of the Nephaeliim in light of the fact that God the Father clearly hated them and wanted all of his people to stop worshiping them while he turned them slowly over time toward his light. I know who my savior is and I believe in his sacrifice and the pathway that made for our fallen species to redeem ourselves in spite of everything we have come to learn about our origins. Lance replied. OPEN YOUR EYES MAN Victor shot back. ENOUGH This argument is pointless we cannot prove any of it anyway and it is detracting from the real purpose of this meeting which is to plan out our war on the surface. That is our concern not whether this YahWeh of Elephantine is real or not nor does it even matter to the current discussion. If I hear one more word on this topic I will send you both back to the ship via spacewalk. Have I made myself clear? Henry stared back and forth between the two men daring them to speak. Yes sir. Lance replied followed by Victor who repeated the same moments after. Good. Let Us keep our heads in the bronze age please. That is our world now whether we like it or not. We have very real and pressing problems that we have only just begun to work out. We cannot afford to allow infighting between us especially not over this. There is a reason we allow for freedom of religion. We cannot prove who is right at this point anymore than we could before we got dropped into this timeline. No good will come of arguing about this until we get more concrete information. Henry said emphatically. Sure thing I know the truth regardless of what Victor wants to say. Lance replied. Heh Lance can keep his dogma. I for one will be very interested to see what happens when we finally make it to Egypt. Victor replied smugly. As delightful as this little argument is Henry is right we need to get back to planning the invasion. We have the beginnings of a plan for how we would like things to go. We should also start making plans for when things inevitably go wrong including what kinds of scenarios in which we can make use of our technological advantages. We need contingency plans as much as primary plans. Paul said. Very well let us start poking holes in the strategy then. Lucas why do not we start with you. Henry said. With pleasure. You could hear the smile through his faceplate. THE NEXT MORNING DATE APRIL 26th 7 A.YOU. AFTER UNIFICATION LOCATION SOL SYSTEM ABOARD UTRN INDOMITABLE WILL ENSIGN PRESTON JENKINS Preston awoke groggily with a stretch in his bed within the junior officers bunk room. His eyes snapped open once he realized the migraine was gone Thank fuck. The past two days had been hellish. He then turned his attention to something new that showed up in his vision as well.

Oh hell yeah Fucking finally Time to dig in and see what this thing can do. Preston thought with a laugh to himself. The interface was strange in a way that it simultaneously overlaid his vision with variable opacity but would disappear the moment he needed to focus on what was in front of him. Okay so it seems to operate on an integrated level with my thoughts so let us try it. What command do I use? Yes... Start... Nope that did not work... Begin guided setup? More menus began to pop up in his expanded vision which began asking him question after question. Bingo He was so enthralled in the process that he almost forgot himself and the time until his stomach began to growl. Oh... right. They did say I would be extra hungry and to eat extra healthy. What time is it anyway? He grabbed his datapad to check. As soon as he saw the time a matching readout appeared in the corner of his vision and then faded almost into invisibility until he focused on it which made it easily readable. Ohninefifty? FUCK going to miss my chow window He then ripped the blanket off himself sending it flying farther than he intended and grabbed for an undershirt to pull it over his head. SHHHRRRIIIP . only for it to tear like it was paper. Are... those abs really mine? I am only at 20 integration....Just how strong am I going to get? There has to be a way to adjust the sensitivity.... FINE MOTOR CONTROL SETTINGS AUTOADJUSTMENT ACTIVATED ADDITIONAL FIELD EXPERIENCE DATA REQUIRED TO COMPLETE PROCESS. VIGOROUS EXERCISE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT RECOMMENDED. Well that is nice of you Compy. Talk about an intuitive interface ET tech for the win I guess. Preston then grabbed a fresh undershirt and gym shorts which he managed to don without tearing this time. This is going to take some getting used to.... Going To be a BEAST in the gym though He thought before his stomach growled at him again. Gym yes... but grub first. With a smirk he hustled over to the mess hall and got in line. When his turn came he grabbed himself a double serving of powdered egg omelet six slices of crispy fakeon and a large bowl of grits and skipped past the shit on a shingle. It still was not enough to satisfy him completely much to his chagrin but a look from the cook gave him pause on the idea of coming back through the line and grabbing more. He then made his way to the gym eager to burn off some of the buzzing energy he felt. Preston started by jumping on the treadmill only to find that he had to keep bumping the speed to feel a challenge. Finally after easily breaking a personal best in his two kilometer time he stepped off feeling more energized than tired. A new notification popped up for him. RESPIROCYTE INTEGRATION LEVEL 15 REST AND RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION He then moved over to the weights and proceeded to smash through more of his previous records. By the time he finished at the squat rack he found himself at long last properly sore actually tired and a brand new member of the twohundred kilogram club. ELECTROMUSCLE INTEGRATION LEVEL 17 REST AND RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION Fucking hell seventeen percent and I Have almost doubled my previous max outs. Just how strong am I able to get now? It is got to taper off somewhere... Going To have to make sure I pay close attention to flexibility too. This could easily get out of hand if I start getting superhero strong. Got To keep everything balanced... Hey freak are you done with the squat rack yet? Just because you got pumped full of xeno drugs does not mean you get to treat the gym like you own the place The same rules still apply fuckface Jenkins turned to look at the source of the interruption a scowling meter and a half of muscular marine stared upwards at him. Do you understand me freak? Or did those xeno fucks scramble your brains too? The smaller man spat as he aggressively dug his finger into Jenkins chest. Where have I seen him before? Fuck it not important right now. You ignoring me or you just too much of a pussy to reply? Or maybe you are just a moron. Do you understand ENGLISH moron? That is enough from this clown. Yeah I heard you asshole. Have Not you ever heard of patience or did you lose that along with your manners? Id have thought your mom would have taught you something about respect but it seems not. The words came out of his mouth almost before he even had a chance to think of the wisdom of actually saying them aloud. Fuck you xeno lover Do Not you dare speak about my mom the woman was a saint Who the fuck do you think you are? The micro meathead replied shoving Jenkins surprisingly hard. FIGHT OR FLIGHT DETECTED COMBAT NEUROHORMONE RELEASE APPROVED Jenkins was pissed now and he shoved him back in retaliation knocking the marine backwards a step. That Is it we settle this now You may have let those xeno fucks experiment on you but you are still no match for honest to God human strength. I Am going to enjoy pounding you into the mat. Unless you are a coward and a traitor too. The man said with a sneer. Finding it hard to think or deescalate as the stims took effect Jenkins smirked and found himself saying You Are on asshole. Instead. Kick his ass Fuck his xenoloving ass up Brock One of the marines three buddies cheered. With pleasure. Brock said with a dark deep laugh before he threaded himself between the ropes in the sparring ring. He cracked his knuckles and rolled his head before stretching a few times to limber up. What are you waiting for pussy? Bet he is scared to fight a real man. Brock taunted. COMBAT SUBROUTINES UPLOADED TO WORKING MEMORY Jenkins stared Brock straight in the eyes and broke into a run before launching himself in a front flip and landed smoothly into the ring. Holy shit I did not know I could do that Combat subroutines huh? Awesome Preston? What the hell is going on? Ariana called out from the entryway to the gym. His heart skipped a beat as he saw her in workout clothes and a towel over her neck. The distraction proved costly as Brock chose that moment to charge him landing a nasty sucker punch to the jaw staggering him. What did those xeno fucks do to you? The hell is your jaw made of steel? Brock shook his hand out before reverting to a more guarded stance as he slowly circled Jenkins. Jenkins turned and spat some blood from a split lip out of the ring. They did a hell of a lot more than that. Here I will show you Jenkins charged in with a feint before pivoting around Brocks answering swing. He grabbed the smaller slab of muscles arm and redirected him into a throw. Brock landed with a roll and got back to his feet closing the distance again with predatory ease. They traded jabs and combos in an attempt to test each others reflexes and defenses yet landed no serious blows. I have an advantage on him in reach time to put it to work for me. Kick that little perverts ass Preston Ariana called out. A memory flashed reminding Jenkins where he had seen this goon before... Running down a hallway in boxers trying to escape a hard lesson in consent at the hands of Ariana. Oh I remember you now roid rage This should be fun. Preston pushed back onto the offensive with a flurry of blows that rained down faster than he had realized he even was capable of. Brock dodged and blocked what he could but several landed anyway. Jenkins had traded speed for power somewhat and Brock was experienced and tough which helped to make each a mere glancing blow. Slowly Jenkins forced Brock back into the corner of the ring. Brock pivoted and grabbed Jenkins around his waist with a leap forcing them both to the ground. Get back on top of him you have got this Ariana cheered as Preston struggled to flip his opponent. You know this bitch? I am going to fuck her up once I finish with you. Me and her got unfinished business. With Jenkins' advantage of extra reach eliminated Brock was able to nearly pin him several times as they wrestled. Only his recent gains in strength and speed seemed to help now as Brock had him beat in talent. Get up hell beat you on the ground if you are not careful Ariana called out. Keep out of this bitch Fuck him up Brock One of Brock's marine friends yelled out. Try and make me asshole Ariana yelled right back staring him down. Jenkins roared and managed to pivot Brock into a throw that landed him against the mat with a painful crunch a few feet away. Jenkins leapt with all his might and landed with an elbow right into Brocks ribs which gave way with a sickening crack. In an instant his friends were in the ring as they lifted him off the mat and onto a shoulder carry while another yelled over his shoulder. This is not over xeno lover You and that whore are DEAD Do Not you dare talk about her like that Ill tear you apart with my bare hands if you even think to try it Jenkins screamed after their retreating forms as he felt the adrenaline fade from his system. A crippling wave of nausea rose to replace it. Before he knew what was happening in the encroaching fog Ariana was supporting him from up under his shoulder as she led him from the ring. Her pleasant warmth and tight grip sent a shudder of pleasure through his addled brain. I feel like shit. Jenkins managed to say as he fought the urge to vomit. COMBAT NEUROHORMONE OVERDOSE DETECTED DEPLOYING COUNTERMEASURES ADJUSTING FUTURE DOSAGE DATA. WARNING RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REST Easy there big guy I have got you. Let Us get you to med bay. Jenkins heard through the fog. Ariana I Stay with me Fuck This is going to take way too long. Clear the way The last thing he felt before he blacked out was a rapid change in gee forces as Ariana lifted them off the ground into a telekinetic assisted flight down the corridor. Post chapter AN Some problems just refuse to go away that easily and few things are as simple as they first appear. There are consequences to most actions good or bad unintended or expected and the bill always eventually comes due. The story will be moving on from the second contact arc soon with it will come a much more serious phase of conflict and even more fateful consequences. Thanks for reading Love it or hate it or even have some questions for me? Feel free to make your opinions known in the comments below
19539,Shingles vaccine: I am currently going through a shingles outbreak. it is been a month and I am still not completely healed. It was pretty painful for a couple weeks. And irritating and annoying the rest of the time. Having constantly sensitive and irritated skin for this long is not fun. They said they will vaccinate me as soon as I clear up. I do not know anything about the vaccine. But if you can avoid getting a shingles outbreak with the vaccine i would recommend you do so.
19540,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: I had chickenpox at 6 months old because my older sister was 6 and got it from someone at school. I have an autoimmune disorder that I did not know about until age 50 which made it so I got shingles at 27for the first time. I had them 7 MORE TIMES in the next 8 years and the insurance REFUSED to pay for the vaccine. I was told to pound sand until I turned 50. I got them 2 more times in the ensuing 12 years and insurance still would not pay for it. The day I turned 50 I was at the pharmacy getting the damn shot. And to make things even more fun 8 of the 10 times I got them they were right under my left eye so there was a real danger of getting a herpes virus of the eye and losing the sight in that eye. So yeah expose your granddaughter to chickenpox and see if you ever get to see her again.
19541,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles at 24. To make things worse I was in a transient tent full of bunks in Kuwait on my way home from Iraq. To make it even worse it was misdiagnosed as a simple rash and by the time the doctor realized what was happening it was too late to start any treatment or so she told me. But believe it or not it gets even worse than that. Shingles typically only occurs on one side of the spine or the other. My case crossed the hemisphere in the doctor's words. Shoulder to shoulder and up to the top of my head. I had bald patches for weeks where the sores had been and have experienced tingling stinging and other phantom sensations for the past 18 years along with migrainelike headaches which I have only been able to keep in check by carefully monitoring almost every aspect of life from sleep to hydration to stress levels and avoiding every type of activity that is not low physical impact. Presumptive permanent nerve damage for which I tried half a dozen prescriptions and settled on one that is usually used to control seizures. The commercials for those vaccines do not exaggerate. If anything the possibilities are far worse than what they warn. If you really want it I would be harassing the absolute hell out of my doctor or finding another one.
19543,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I took the vaccine and then got shingles as a side effect doc was amazed when I refused the second shot no vaers report made hope others had a better experience
19546,RSV vaccine Abryso because: I got mine at Shoppers. My arm did not hurt from it unlike covid flu tdap
19548,Shingles vaccine: I was like you w COVID19 shots. I was off for 12 hours post shots. W shingles vaccine. Nothing. Like a flu shot. For me no ill effects whatsoever with either dose. Good on you. I had shingles at a young age. Fucking miserable is an understatement
19551,Oh boy. Hopefully your 2nd dose side effects will be mild. My 2nd was rough but worth it Shingles scares me. Good luck
19553,Shingrix? Anyone prioritizing the vaccine to prevent shingles?: Shingles is so debilitating that the vaccine is truly worth it make sure you return for the second dose. However the vaccine does not 100 prevent shingles. I know someone who had both doses in 2021  currently has shingles. It appears to be an incredibly mild case which I am sure is due to being vaccinated.
19555,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I hope to ALL HELL I never get shingles That is the cool thing though. Once you get the shingles virus it just hangs out in your system. I got chicken pox when I was like 3 and then 12 years later I wake up with the left side of my face paralyzed from Bells Palsy that is caused by you guessed it the shingles virus.
19558,Shingles and other Vaccines: Dude over 55 here that shingles vaccine put me DOWN. But my 50F friend browbeat me into getting it by telling me how bad her shingles was so it was still worth it.
19559,I was diagnosed with shingles on my chin and cheek yesterday after I dropped off my baby at daycare. Its my understanding that as long as the blisters are not oozing it is not contagious being that my baby is only 3 months and as careful as I am being around him I am still scared to take him back in on Monday to be around a bunch of other babies. What would you do? I also have a 6 year old who goes to elementary and hes had his chicken pox vaccinations. My mom and sister she is had it twice keep suggesting I get medical leave and from what I am reading on rshingles I need to be sleeping and resting as much as I can but I do not even know how to go about it I just returned to work 2 weeks ago 10 week maternity leave.
19560,Shingles second vaccine: I do not want Shingles but I am still deciding if the migraine was worth it
19561,Shingrix Vaccine Reminder: I got Shin gri x as soon as I turned 50. First dose was nothing. Second dose I had a fever for about 6 hours and then felt kind of tired. By the next day I was completely fine. S hring r ix is much more effective than the older shingles vaccine. My best friend's mom had shingles a few years ago and it went into her brain. She developed encephalitis and she almost died. It happened really fast. Bad headache on Sunday in the hospital hallucinating on Wednesday. She is now telling everyone to get vaccinate vaccinated vaccinated. Shingles is not usually that serious but even a mild case is very painful.
19567,For real get the shingles vaccine. I had that shit this summer and it is zero fun.
19574,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I got shingles last year. And it made me REALLY mad i didn't get the vaccine. It was really painful
19577,How long after your first shingles shot did you start feeling like shit?: Had my first shot two weeks ago hurt like hell the first few minutes but nothing since guess I will get my adverse reaction in September. Or not
19578,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: You only get shingles if you have had chickenpox the new vaccine prevents it. Rather ironic. I am a few years too old so I missed out on the chicken pox vaccine. I also caught shingles when I was in my early 30's. The lingering nerve damage has led to me not being able to exercise like I used to I get pains where I had shingles if I do aerobic exercise which hurts my sleep and makes it harder to do more exercise. I can basically chart any adult weight gain I have had to getting shingles. I am so pissed at this stupid woman for giving her granddaughter a perfectly preventable disease.
19579,This pain is the worst one of the worst I Have ever had in my entire life I would be lying and hopefully I Am not breaking any rules here I Am just being honest. I would be lying if I did not say that in the midst of the worst pain I am not thinking about dying Pain meds are helping sometimes and then other times i feel like they are not helping at all. I Am even using lidocaine patches where the doctor told me to on my back for the shingles and for the stabbing pain I do not want to shower. I do not want to pee. I do not want to do anything. My husband has been a miracle. My doggies have been a miracle. My mother has been a miracle but I have no friends where we live and I feel very alone. I was taken to the emergency room by ambulance on Saturday. The pain was so bad and I could not breathe. I spent the entire day there and the doctor and the nurses were so nice to me. The doctor actually gave me two different shots of pain medicine and he was kind. He did not treat me like a drug seeker or some kind of weirdo. They told me that I just have to ride this out. Well if I have to ride this pain out for the next 6 to 8 weeks I do not know its awful and I just want it to go away. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this pain please let me know because when the pain is that its worst I honestly think about dying and I feel like I Am dying. Thank you for listening. Thank you for being here. This group has been the best
19580,41 and got Shingles: I got them when I was only 32 or so after a super stressful life event that I think must have lowered my immunity and made me susceptible. I got it on my face which was awful and have some deep scars from it that I wish I could make go away. Anyway I think you can get it any time and I wonder if it preys on a weakened immune system for whatever reason. Hope you get better soon
19582,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: First shot did not bother me too much but second knocked me on my ass for about a day and a half. I have known people that have had Shingles and they were near death for months and had permanent scarring. So I will take it.
19586,Shingles vaccine experience: Shingles on my hand was one of the worst experiences I Have ever had painwise. Id get the vaccine.
19587,My dr says the exhaustion is not from shingles...: My rash is so mild too it is the fatigue that is making things difficult. I am definitely glad I found this subreddit...shingles has been an awful experience but having people who get it is helping me mentally for sure
19591,Getting RSV shot during pregnancy? Triple check they give you the right one.: I Am not going to take the shot. After reviewing the riskreward I do not personally find it worth it. I also do not live in a cold climate during winter. Will be doing other mitigation to avoid getting sick but I Have had a very complicated pregnancy  vaccine injured from JJ C19 with issues I deal with daily that I will not risk my hard fought first pregnancy. Stories like this make me so angry for OP. I Am so sorry this happened. This kind of thing should never happen. Medical negligence is way too common and the response from the offending parties is often lacking.
19592,"Got J&J COVID Vaccine, Got Shingles. What Now?: So, evidently this is a thing? About 3 weeks after I got my COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson), I started to feel itchy on my chest and was later diagnosed with shingles. It went kinda like this: 1. **Day 1** - itchy area on right side of chest 2. **Day 2** - rash develops, notice back hurts 3. **Day 3** - feel worse, tell wife, Google rashes, think it might be shingles 4. **Day 4** - persistent pain on right front/back of torso, go to clinic, get diagnosed with shingles, get Valtrex for treatment 5. **Day 5** - Pain worsened, headaches, mild disorientation The APN who diagnosed me said there's been an uptick in shingles since COVID-19. She said that the vaccine possibly weakens your immune system enough to allow this to happen. No clue how scientifically accurate that is. I'm still SUPER HAPPY I got vaccinated (and encourage everyone to do the same), but *holy hell.* Anyone have any idea how long this should last? What other surprises should I expect? Or this basically it until the medication starts to beat it down? Ugh. I'm in my mid-thirties, BTW."
19601,Covid 19 Vaccine induced shingles. Say no to sodomy No monkey pox for you. lol
19603,Anyone Under 50 got their shingles vaccine: I wish it had been available. I had Shingles at 38on lower face and inside mouth. I got the vaccine as soon as it was freaking available
19608,Just grabbed a prescription for my wife at the pharmacy and the pharmacist reminded me to get the shingles vaccine because anyone over fifty should have it. I was born in 1987.: The rash I had was not bad it was the random stabbing pain in my spine that would not allow me to straighten my head and would buckle my knees
19613,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Definitely talk to your doctor but I had a similar experience where I was hospitalized with horrible chicken pox and I only had a very mild case of shingles. It might not end up being that bad.
19614,Shingles ...not an old person affliction: Had it on my back in my 20s. Sucked hard. Was mostly on my back. Got the vaccine for my 50th birthday. Mom who has an autoimmune disease her entire life got it a few years back and still has it. that is because she is on biologics and that knocks down her overactive immune system. While it is better she still has to be careful what fabrics she wears and luckily we found a certain CBD lotion that really helps while most everything else she tried did not. My friend her mom also caught it a few years back and it attacked one side of her face bad. Same thing it is been a few years and its still flaring up.
19616,Relapse fears?: That Is how my cousin got shingles got vaccinated at work back in 2010 and been fighting it since
19617,Crash after dose: I am on shot 20 and I am usually fatigued day after shot. It does get better or I have gotten better prepared or I have realized it is worth it... not sure but it is better. I tell myself it is my body doing what it needs to in the background to change. Hang in there it is worth it.
19619,Shingles at 35: I Am 34 and got it in my eye It took 7 days and 5 ER visits before a Dr finally said. Its shingles. They do not think about shingles because of our age. But after going through it in April and joining these groups. I have seen sooo many people our age and younger have it. It amazes me they will not stop and even consider it. Had they considered it especially considering all my symptoms were basic shingles symptoms they could have started the meds quicker and it would have never gotten so bad. My entire face and eye ball was covered in shingles It was awful and I STILL have bad vision and nerve damage
19626,Shingles vaccine: I have had shingles twice and you are only supposed to get it once. The emergency room doctor labeled the second bout as atypical. Yeah no kidding. The first time was right underneath my waistband. Second time was across the right side of my face and neck. Get the shot please.
19627,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles in my head left side when I was 21 1991 It was awful and I almost lost my sight in my left eye as it was in there too and the eye med alone was 400 in 1991. I RAN to get the vaccine as soon as I got old enough to I NEVER want to experience that again.
19628,Am I the only one? Tdap: I got tdap and RSV while pregnant would NOT recommend getting them together I had a terrible reaction to it I am not having others do it as the baby will already have protection. My family is also not the type to come around if they are sick. I have seen stories of this causing rifts in families and it is kind of sad. But everyone is different so I do not judge what you want to do I am just saying I did not go that route. Edit always love the downvotes on this supportive subreddit. I offer what I do that works for my family and say I support whatever anyone else needs to do for their family and the reaction is to downvote because well I guess I am supportive. And yes I had a terrible reaction to getting both vaccines at the same time. I would still get them if I became pregnant again but I would do one at a time because call me crazy but I do not want to have to go 3 days without eating and drinking again at 7 months and then sit in the hospital with and IV and be monitored. vaccine reactions are real and discussing side effects does not mean I am antivaccine.
19630,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: My baby had it she was fine. I went through hell to try to find it last year because the rollout was so bad and the most vulnerable babies preemies and immunocompromised could not access it. Its tested and safe. Please protect your little one
19633,Going to get my 2nd shingles shot in 15 minutes witness me: Damn....my shingles shot felt like a gun shot within a few hours. But my FIL had flareups all the time so I was like nah I will deal with the pain for a few days. Glad I did because he had another flareup which got me thinking that it is a good thing I suffered for a couple days rather than a few months. Really the pain is worth it to pretty much eliminate the risk of shingles.
19635,Shingles and other Vaccines: Get the shot. I had shingles and it was the most miserable painful thing I Have ever had. Get the vaccine
19639,I took the first shingles vaccine some hears ago then both doses of the new one and had no side effects at all. I guess Your mileage may vary applies to vaccines also
19641,I do not know if this is the place to ask but I am at my wits end. It is a bit long so I appreciate if you will read my post. Three years ago I started taking pravastatin for my cholesterol and triglycerides. Within weeks of taking it I had what I believed was shingles on my left rib cage I went to urgent care got a medication and healed. Over the course of the next year I had regularly occurring outbreaks every 8 weeks or so. Sometimes on my left ribs sometimes on my lower right back and other times on my upper left arm. Doctor says it cannot possibly be shingles because of the rate of recurrence. She puts me on a daily dose of valcyclovir but the outbreaks persist for another 18 months. We tried to get medical clearance for the shingrex vaccine but doctors are not cleared to administer it unless someone is at least 50 years old. At the next outbreak she collected a biopsy of the lesions and it came back as herpes simplex virus genital herpes At my next physical a liver panel showed elevated enzymes so she took me off both valcyclovir and pravastatin which was 10 months ago and my outbreaks stopped. I have been outbreak free for 10 months but my recent lipid panel showed my numbers went up quite high so she put me on rosuvastatin and 10 days into the medication I have another outbreak on my lower back. She acknowledges medical literature suggests a connection between herpes zoster chicken pox shingles and statins but not herpes simplex virus genital herpes. She also acknowledges that my lesions appear in places herpes zoster does and that I have never had an outbreak on my genitals like herpes simplex does. She has set me up an appointment to see a cardiologist to talk about being prescribed repatha to avoid statins. But my question is this. Have any of you ever had recurring herpes of any kind outbreak on your body while taking statins? I have only ever had them while taking a statin and only on those same three spots on my body nowhere else.
19645,I thought I got a very minor case of shingles on my cheek jaw in July and then I quickly realized that it was really affecting my ears. I had insane ear swelling pressure pain daily. I got diagnosed with Ramsay hunt and I took meds as soon as we realized what was going on. Well now months later its December and I am still taking the same anti virals since July. I Have had zero skin sores but I still have nonstop ear pain feeling of ear swelling and pretty significant tinnitus in both ears. My doctor says its impassible that I should be having this happen in both ears which I totally agree with lol but it definitely is happening. My lymph nodes are also always swollen now but I Am chalking that up to my long term anti virals. Has anyone had any similar presentations like this to Ramsey Hunt or also needed very long term medication use despite the rash being gone? Anyone have any weird ear issues? I have spoken to a few different doctors and have not been able to gather much more info other than what I found on google. On another note has anyone continued with long term anti virals because you feel increasingly poor symptomswise the second you stop taking them? I also shared that with my doctor and he was like you should not be able to feel that kind of difference in terms of your symptoms when you skip one pill  its just a placebo effect etc. But I am certain as anything that if I skip a dose I feel like shit and my ears get worse. Would love to hear your story  wisdom if you can in anyway relate to mine
19647,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: I have had shingles and the vaccine. Shingles is no fun. At worst the vaccine gives you a sore arm and maybe a shortterm fever.
19649,I am 51F at a total loss. I am guessing this weirdness is my special brand of long Covid. Also I think this will be my favorite sub. tldr since 7yrs ago several negative HSV tests OBs becoming more frequent recent HSV2 diagnosis developing resistance to valacyclovir get depression with acyclovir lysine causes stomach problems. 2010 I entered a monogamous relationship with my partner M. No known STIs. A couple years later had a kid vaginal birth. 2017 had first OB on genitalia left side only. My GP said it was shingles. HSV test was negative. Treated with 5 days of valacyclovir and it went away. Early 2020 probably came down with Covid was not allowed to test at that time and ended up in the ER with a bunch of different symptoms and an OB like the one from 2017. HSV test at the hospital was negative. Followup with OBGYN and tested for HSV there negative. Took valacyclovir for 5 days and the OB went away. Throughout 2020 had OBs every few months started having oral OBs also on the left side. Needed to take valacyclovir for longer periods of time from 5 days to 2 weeks until it went away. Early 2021 OBs became more frequent and breakthrough OBs started to happen. Started taking valacyclovir as suppressive therapy. Tried acyclovir for a couple weeks I became very depressed. Do not know for sure if it is related. August 2021 had a surgery woke up with an OB in a new location inside my mouth on the right side where the intubation equipment was resting on my face. After that OB went away nothing for six months. February 2022 OBs started again usually in mouth. Started valacyclovir for suppressive therapy. September 2022 I turned 50yo and got the Shingrix shots. OBs completely stopped for over a year. October 2023 started to have prodrome sensations and then OBs since December. December 2023 PCR test results showed negative for HSV12. February 2024 tried taking 1g LLysine daily OB went away but after 3 weeks had bad stomach pain gassyswollen abdomenconstipation. March 2024 PCR test results showed positive for HSV2. Now taking a 14 tablet of 250mg lysine daily. Still not great on stomach. Prodrome is slowly going away but it is been there for over a month. What can I do now?
19651,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: I had a similarly rough time with the vaccine but having watched other people go through shingles including one who currently has it in her EYE I am so glad to have to have those hardearned antibodies inside me.
19653,Shingles vaccine: In the rGenX sub its a hot topic and many of us have gotten it. Its definitely worth it. If you ever had chickenpox its a high possibility you will get shingles. They Are not nice I Have had them and they can permanently disfigure you blind you and because you lifelong pain. The shot is painful and do not plan anything for a couple days after you get it. But the 2 shot system keeps you covered for 5 years. The vaccine now is not a live virus anymore so you will not get a case from it or possibly spread it to anyone else.
19654,"Yesterday, I got the flu shot and today I woke up with a killer headache. Can side effects really appear a day after the vaccination? I felt like I was hit by a ton of bricks yesterday with fever and body aches, and today it's all about this headache. But hey, anything is better than battling the flu, right? Just trying to figure out if this is normal, thanks for any advice!"
19655,Shingles vaccine experience: What really sucks is that I have had shingles twice once in my 30s and again mid 40s. I try to get the vaccine and keep getting told I am too young. My PCP has tried to get it approved by my insurance and still declined. First time was my torso second time was a literal pain in my a. Doctor says maybe we might get lucky now that I am 50. Will find out when I go for my yearly check up next month.
19663,So we just got back from immediate care. My wife had what looked like a really bad case of poison ivy on her hand and arm. Started in hand and started progressing up. She had been weeding late last week. Her arm had been hurting really bad for a week before that with no skin symptoms. She thought she had overdone it painting the kitchen. Her hand is swollen up and in a lot of pain. Turns out shingles will follow the nerve. Hence the progression. She has not gotten the vaccine as she was on the fence with some of them and figured how bad can it be? Needless to say as soon as this clears up she is getting her shots. I have not yet just been lazy but that is getting remedied post haste. Fun fact poison ivy treatments will apparently make shingles worse. If you are on the fence get the vaccine.
19665,So this is an ongoing FU I do not know what is going on yet but my feet and hands went numb about two weeks ago not even prediabetic by the way per recent blood work. I have had neuropathy before from having had shingles twice so I was not too concerned just uncomfortable at first. It has always gone away on its own before which is probably why I was so stubborn and stupid about this. I guess I just did not want to pay to get brushed off by yet another PCP with no real answers. The only good one I have had in my city moved away and I just have not bothered to find a new one. Stupid I know. The numbness slowly turned into burning and the burning became unbeqarable. The best way I can describe it is like when your foot falls asleep it is the part in the middle of it waking up when it is in that hypersensitivetoeventheslightesttouchpins  needles phase 10 along with a combo of burning with little jolts of almost electric like pain to keep it interesting. By the time our story takes place I could barely walk and every step was agony. My hands began to feel like I would been scrubbing them with fiberglass and were so incredibly weak I could hardly hold my phone or write. It is just relentless the pain never let us up not even for sleep. We have established I am stupid right? I tried every OTC pain relief I could possibly think of aspirin ibuprofen voltaren gel ketamine as prescribed by my psychiatrist helping with chronic pain was an unexpected but welcome bonus hot Epsom salt bath ice packs etc. you name it I tried it. I was determined not to go to the ER I have an appointment already set up with my endocrinologist in early January I convinced myself I could wait it out. Does the frog in a pot of slowly boiling water analogy work here? So of course by the time Dec 23rd rolls around I was almost going crazy from the painsleep deprivation it was almost as bad as gall stones rot in hell you piece of shit useless organ and that so far has been my 1010 pain. I would say I was at a 910 at that moment childbirth was not even as bad as this pain granted the epidural was definitely pulling its weight during labor. I still could not stand the idea of ruining our 6 year old's Christmas though. Also I live in Murica' so the idea of the bill terrifies me. So I decided to go an alternate route. This would be my Hail Mary. Vape shop drugs. So my husband is kind of buddies with the owner of the local vape shop and had told him about what I was going through. The owner suggested I try Kratom. I would tried it before ages ago and not only did it not reduce my pain or anxiety it did not agree with my stomach contents either. I have not done Kratom or any of its ilk in years though so what do I know? Maybe it is better qualitymore effective these days? I told my husband who had fully been on team go to the ER now for awhile that I would try his buddies Kratom idea and give it an hour if it did not help I would tap out and go to the ER forever labeled a Grinch. So he hastily heads to the vape shop and like The Flash's dodgy cousin returns no more than 15 minutes later hucking a bottle of Zaza Red Extra Strength my way IYKYK...I did not know at all I skim the back to see how many capsules to take but there was no specified dose so I just took two capsules like I did years ago. I laid down and set an alarm I was not hopeful about anything either way at this point I was exhausted . To my great surprise though after about 20 minutes the pain just started...melting away. It was glorious euphoric even one might say. The Zaza Kratom has saved the day My husband who was already my hero even offered to finish up wrapping gifts and get the prime rib prepped for the Christmas Eve dinner. Shortly after I fell asleep on the couch while doom scrolling reddit I could not remember the last time I would felt so relaxed I finally got a good night's rest. Pain was what woke me at 5am the next day Christmas Eve but I had my stopgap solution until my endocrinologists appointment You do not scare me pain I took two Zaza capsules and within 30 minutes was up and moving around the pain was maybe 4510 which is only a bit above my baseline. I could do this The only thing really bugging me was being itchy I was itchy everywhere. Soooo itchy. This should have been my first real clue that something was not right but I was in full on Christmas prep mode so I just took some Benadryl and chalked it up to switching to a new hay for our guinea pigs. I subsequently blamed the Benadryl as the culprit behind my nodding off every time I sat down to relax read etc. The pain was under control I had slain that Evil with the help of my own Non FDA Approved Supplement version of Excalibur. Maybe Kratom only works if you are in acute pain I pondered or maybe it is just gotten stronger as time has gone on. In the back of my mind though there was a familiarity to the itchinessSleepinessEuphoria tied to postop pain medspost wisdom tooth removal recovery etc. It reminded me of Vicodin. Christmas was a cozy lovely day with my little family and I it is true what they say holidays are totally different when you add a kid into the mix especially once they are old enough to get really excited about it. It almost makes you believe in the magic too It was about as perfect as it could be and we put our kid to bed full of roast beast and able to beat us at Yahtzee. Sounds like a pretty great holiday despite the lead up right? How did the vape shop pills ruin Christmas I thought they helped? you may be asking furthermore Why did you waste my time reading this you fuckin' asshole?. Well simmer down we are getting there and writing this is keeping me occupied while I wait. So at some point after all the Christmas excitement dies down or while once again doom scrolling reddit comfortably it will be so much easier to touch grass without the pain it occurred to me why have I never heard of this magical Zaza Kratom before? I am in a bunch of chronic pain groups and I see suggestions for different strains of Kratom pop up with decent regularity but never this Zaza one. Maybe since it had been years since I would last tried it I would just forgotten about this strain? Still now that I was no longer contemplating throwing myself off a bridge my curiosity had been piqued. I needed to know more about this unicorn of an OTC supplement. Naturally I googled Zaza Red Extra Strength Kratom and my heart dropped as I saw strikethroughs on the word Kratom and one of the first links was fucking Gas Station Heroin from a addiction treatment center no less Turns out that is the nickname for Tianeptine. I immediately checked my pill bottle and there it was in tiny lettering Tianeptine. I consider myself somewhat hip for a 36 year old but I would never even heard of Tianeptine or Tia before. I had been taking a double dose of what is basically shady loophole heroin for days I had Mandela Effected myself into thinking the word Kratom was on the bottle somewhere but nope just Zaza Red Extra Strength. I panicked. The more I read the worse it got tales of instant addiction withdrawals worse than real heroin meth or benzo's they can take weeks to get through etc. I am sure well I hope some of that information is just fear mongering but thinking back on the last few days anecdotally a lot of what I read sounded extremely close to my experience with it. I could see easily getting addicted to it just based on efficacy and availability alone. My poor husband just trying his best to help me had grabbed the Zaza Red instead of the Kratom strain Bali Red and we are both so behind on our desperate times drug knowledge. It could have happened to anyone. Now he is convinced himself I am going to be hooked and that he is ruined my life or that he will have to watch me go through awful withdrawals. I am trying to convince him he is the best thing that ever happened in my life 18 years together this March. Mystery of the unicorn drug solved if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Stay the fuck away from Tianeptine I would like to be around for next Christmas so I called poison control since I had taken so much without realizing how harmful this drug can be. They said do not pass go do not collect 200 go straight to the ER. I will probably be in the waiting room until next Christmas because everybody who did not feel well on Christmas but did not want to miss out me floods the ER the day after. It took me forever to even type this out because invisible fiberglass mittens are back in style. Hopefully they can figure out the reason these shenanigans started to begin with the pain. If anyone is interested I can post an update whenif I get a diagnoses. If there is anything to be learned from my tale it is to not be like me a massive calamitous idiot who did not even bother to read the fine print and should have gone to the ER when the pain started. Remember that frog analogy? I am the frog. As the ones who are actually hip say I am cooked. TLDR I fucked up by putting off going to the ER despite escalating pain because I thought I could just deal with it until my endocrinologists appointment in early January. I could not. The pain became unbearable on December 23rd and in a desperate bid to at least spend the holidays at home with my husband  daughter and avoid a terrifying hospital bill I agreed to try Kratom again after at least 5 years It did not help with my chronic pain at all just upset stomach etc. so I never tried it again as a desperate Hail Mary. My husband grabbed Zaza Red instead of Bali Red. I felt amazing so relaxed almost pain free. Neither of us noticed til almost 3 days later that it was not Kratom at all but rather Tianeptine or Tia or Truck Stop Heroin' and I would been taking a double dose of it. It was in tiny fine print under the Mg amounts. Called Poison Control and am AT THE ER NOW before I get yelled at in the comments to go to the ER lol all of this could have been avoided if I would been an ad mmult and gone to the ER in the first place.
19666,Does nerve pain now mean it is likely to stay? Do some people just not get nerve pain?: My shingles went into severe itching on Day 16 the day after my severe pain left. My doctor prescribed Hydroxyzine for me. I took a pill at 2pm makes you sleepy and one at bedtime. It helped tremendously. I was about ready to scratch off my eyebrow. Eventually I only had to take the bedtime pill. I would not have made it without hydroxyzine. Hope you get to feeling better soon.
19667,Shingles vaccine: Transplant team told me I needed it so I got it done. Some discomfort in your arm for a couple of days not too bad. I have heard that shingles are awful.
19671,Shingrix dose 2 coming next Wednesday. What were peoples experiences with the second shot?: Frequent topic here... Some people not much others like me felt like hit with a metal pipe in the arm which hurt to move and severe achespainsflu like symptoms for 4 days. Was not fun.
19672,Shingles vaccine experience: I caught shingles and I was so sick I just lay in bed and cried with pain much worse with any tiny movement  and I took a video of myself and set it as a reminder to go get a shingles vaccine as soon as I was able No regrets ever even paying full price for it
19673,41 and got Shingles: That sounds awful I had a few spots on my side and that was bad enough.
19674,: I was told to get the vaccine because of my disease mitochondrial myopathy. My health has rapidly declined because of that.
19677,Something Is seem to be better then some things feel different. Am i healing? Has anyone healed from no rash shingles. Can you share your healing experience with some detail. Thank you.
19678,I just got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.: Alright I will definitely do that. I think I have to go back to get a second shot for herpes zostershingles.
19679,RSV vaccine in the nicu?: 34 week old baby got his before he came home in October. No regrets he did fine.
19680,Shingles vaccine experience: I watched a 60yo coworker I am 48 go through full blown shingles. He made it close to a week working but then it hit him hard around his left eye. He was off the next week and a half while recovering. Not something I would wish on anyone. I plan on getting the vaccine
19684,Shingles vaccine: I got both shots and never had any side effects.
19686,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Thanks I really hope it does not happen to you. Some days I am in worse pain some days I do not feel it unless I overextend I got it in my right shoulder blade and I am right handed so I have to be careful. Please call your doctor if the pain is too much. I had it before the current restrictions on painkillers and those painkillers save me. It felt like someone had taken a large knife like in Game of Thrones and set it on fire and stabbed me in my right shoulder blade. Really ask the doctor for stronger painkillers. I hope you are able to sleep.
19691,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: I had chicken pox and then shingles at 25. I was in agony for weeks before I even figured out I had it. A single cold breeze and I was writhing and screaming on the floor. Now keep in mind I sleep when I get tattoos. Shingles was like every nerve was firing at once and every muscle decided that was its moment to cramp. The only way to stop my suffering just a little was having to sit in a dry heat where I could sweat and make the pain just a little more bearable. Do Not get shingles.
19694,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I just had my first bout of shingles this last summer. It popped up out of nowhere I did not know what it was at first. I thought it was poison ivy but it just got worse and worse. Went to the doctor and they immediately said shingles. The first bout was terrible it burns itches your sore tough to get comfortable at all. After several weeks it dissipated but I noticed it came back about a week later. Immediately went back to the doctors to get on medication and it stopped it in its tracks. Fingers crossed that is been my last bout so far. Because I had two outbreaks back to back the doctor said if I keep getting it I could get the vaccine for it despite being only 44. Shingles is horrible if you notice any sort of outbreak on your armpits or chest get it checked out as soon as possible. It also tends to start on just one side of the body and spread. My left side was riddled with shingles right side was clear.
19696,41 and got Shingles: I had them at 36 it was awful
19697,Hi I Am reaching out cuz I was recently diagnosed and its so shitty how it was done. I went a got a Pap smear in august and they emailed me in November saying that there was a computer glitch and I have it then never gave me more information. I was even vaccinated for hpv when I was in hs and when I look on google all it says is I can get it but its extremely rare once vaccinated. I Am abstaining from sex and my partner is pissy about it cuz they started getting vaccinated and was one of the few men that had extreme adverse effects so they did not ever get the second shot and I do not want to get them sick. Also ovarian cancer runs in my family. They will not even give me a pap or more info til the new year and not knowing anything is hell. Please help
19699,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: Yeah I just remember chicken pox the red bumps and itchy as hell I still have scars from scratching too much. You do not want to get shingles. The pain is maddening
19704,I am posting to share some information I Have gathered for those in SC and other states may offer who are looking for affordable options for the HPV especially for individuals with little or no income. Since many people ask me Here are some resources and tips that might help if you do not have insurance or cannot afford HPV care 1. Department of Health and Environmental Control DHEC offers lowcost or even free vaccines for eligible individuals. They have specific programs for uninsured or underinsured residents and you may qualify for assistance based on your income level. 2. Family Planning and Medicaid You can apply for family planning services which can include HPV screening. If you are diagnosed with CIN 23 you may be eligible to apply for Medicaid insurance. This could help cover the costs of treatment and followup care. 3. Using EBT for Health Personally I Have used EBT to help improve my diet and overall health. By buying healthier foods with EBT I Have been able to support my immune system while managing my HPV. 4. Medicaid for Appointments and Medications I also use Medicaid for my dental ENT and OBGYN appointments. It even covers transportation to and from my appointments as well as pharmacy visits. Additionally I was able to use Medicaid to purchase multivitamins to support my health and daily probiotic supplement for vaginal health. Also my eye exam. 5. Outofpocket expenses  To help support and boost my immune system I Have been using AHCC Turkey Tail and Reishi mushrooms. For a 3month supply my outofpocket expenses after Subscribe  Save if offered were as follows  AHCC 365  Turkey Tail 60  Reishi 60  Multivitamins 103 These are stronger than what Medicaid covers but the ones Medicaid provides are still great Additional Tips for HPV and Cervical Health As soon as you receive your Pap test results its important to start working on improving your overall health and clearing any potential infections including STDsSTIs BV or yeast infections. Start taking your vitamins right away especially if you have HSIL and ensure you complete the full dose. Also do not forget to get the HPV vaccine if you have not already and use condoms to reduce the risk of spreading HPV and other STDs. When using your EBT focus on purchasing organic foods to nourish your body. If you drink juice make sure its 100 orange juice with no added sugars or sweeteners. Otherwise stick to drinking plenty of water. After clearing all infections schedule your colposcopy. If no lesions are found consider opting for an ECC instead of a random biopsy or LEEP. You can schedule your ECC 30 days after clearing any infections allowing you more time to boost your immune system and ensure you are in the best health possible. If you have any other suggestions or experiences with affordable healthcare in SC feel free to share Let Us help spread the word so more people can get protected. Here is my HPV story
19705,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: That oatmeal bath hurt. I remember feeling like it made all of the blisters pop open and I just screamed and cried until my mom got me out.
19707,Is keeping the cervix really a big cancer risk if you have received the Gardasil vaccine are HPV negative and have never had an abnormal pap smear?: I Am nonbinary  my reason for a hysto is 95 endometriosisrelated problems and 5 gender. I Am really only posting in this sub because I really do not want to get misgendered which feels inevitable on the other sub. Once I Am finally endometriosis free Ill be getting my paps  other downtherecare from Planned Parenthood which is where I already get my hormones assuming that the misoyniststransphobes do not shut PP down on their antiabortion and antitrans crusade. So nope no more time in rooms with 100 cis women and ill be getting paps from a transaffirming provider so I Am very unconcerned.
19708,"Pretty sure I've got Ramsay-Hunt: So, it's been just slightly under a month since my shingles diagnosis. About four days later, I woke up with very dulled hearing in my left ear. Went in to Urgent Care on Labor Day. They gave me an ENT and audiology referral and they basically just said ""it's not nerve damage, but we don't really know why you lost your hearing."" They gave me prednisone and I was on my way. Three weeks later, the ear pain is getting more and more constant, and I woke up yesterday after a nap not being able to fully open or shut my jaw. So, I'm going back in to urgent care I'm just so tired of all the doctor visits that seem to end with no answer. I'm tired of taking medication that either doesn't work or causes so many side effects it sucks. My god am I tired of taking Tylenol like it's tick tacks. I'm kind of skeptical if I'm going to actually get an answer today or if I'm just going to get the run around and leave empty handed. Shittiest part is I'm unemployed right now and I desperately need to find a job, but now with my hearing being impacted and my speech getting a funky, it's been hard to set up interviews and feel like I'm giving it my all. God I hope things change soon. Shingles, you suck."
19713,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I got it in '68. I was 10yo. No clue where it came from. I just woke up one day with itchy dots alllll over. I do plan on getting the shingles vaccine Just got to get off my butt do it. ETA After reading thru other replies I suddenly feel extremely old.
19715,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Its better than shingles. My friend got it and said it was the worst pain of her entire life. OP I am so sorry you are having a bad reaction to the vaccine and I hope you feel better soon. Congratulations on taking care of your health and everyone around you. I hope you got yourself a treat My family rule is that we use the CVS vaccine coupon to buy makeup candy or a toy as a reward for being brave. At 48 I still need this
19719,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Do not lock your knees when you stand. Her legs buckled a bit as she bent them and I bet she just tried to fight through the world closing in around her before passing out. I could be wrong. I have seen it happen several dozen times though.
19720,Shingles?: I haven t had shingles but have had my first dose of the vaccine and am having the second next week. My husband just had his second dose too. It is a rough vaccine but it is for everyone and it didn t flare my symptoms in any ways I didn t expect if that makes sense.
19721,My genital warts are disappearing? Post Gardasil 9 vaccine: The moment I noticed i have GW was the moment i immediately got the gardasil 9 vaccine last year of june. Now i am wart free.
19724,Baby RSV Shot: My son got his at 8 weeks and did perfectly fine just slept extra. I did give him a bath the day after the appointment just in case first soreness.
19727,Do not know where else to ask this about the shingles vaccine...: Thank you. I do have a rush to get this mainly due to my crazy schedule over the next 68 weeks or so and the fact that my husband who had both the older vaccine AND the 2part Shingrix is recovering from shingles now and I do not want to go through what he just did albeit a milder case. I do not often react strongly to vaccines and am hoping this will be the case today.
19728,Shingles vaccine: I have had both doses and I did not experience any issues at all. It is a total game changer. I had 2 bouts of Shingles and can 100 guarantee any reaction is not even close to getting shingles.
19731,Hey everyone I Am about two weeks in since my symptoms first started. The blisters have dried up but the pain is still really bad especially today. It becomes somewhat manageable when I take pregabalin but honestly its driving me crazy. I can barely walk properly at this point. For anyone who is dealt with vaginal or genital shingles when did your pain finally go away? How long did it take for you to feel normal again?
19733,The Uncomfortable Truth Of What Really Happened With COVID Dr. Paul Offit: My daughter's 23 year old best friend died from blood clots after her two doses. Other countries have made documentaries about the excessive deaths and injuries that have happened since the roll out of the shots but not America. And while other countries provided access to drugs that worked if you took them early our protocol was to wait till you were so sick you had to be ventilated which was financially incentivized.
19734,Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Bells Palsy face paralysis post herpectic neuralgia PHN pain and complications help: I also had shingles on my faceneck this spring 58 F and now have a random twitch in my face on the dermatome where the shingles were. it comes and goes but it is there daily. I also have zaps and zingers in various parts of my body sometimes they are very painful sometimes they are just like a pin prick. those seem to be quieting down lately whereas immediately after my infection they were very noticeable. the facial twitch however is not going away and is kind of worrying me. I also still have some itching where the shingles on my face was. this stuff is very weird.
19735,"weird inflammation on skin. it keeps growing and it hurts. it doesnt itch. does anyone know what this is? i have had no sexual/intimate encounter for the past 15 years.: weird inflammation on skin. it keeps growing and it hurts. it doesnt itch. does anyone know what this is? i have had no sexual/intimate encounter for the past 15 years. 59F,160cm,55kg,asian [picture of inflammation](<url>)"
19736,Shingles Is NO Joke: I live outside the US and had to pay about 400 for the two shot version which works much better than the one shot version. I got it because a close friend got shingles and it was not just some uncomfortable blisters on her skin it was blisters in her ears and behind her eyeballs. I had no idea it could be so terrible.
19738,Mother is vaccine now I have shingles at 23 yo.: Whether or not getting shingles is your moms fault she sucks for being vaccine and you have every right to be angry with her. It sounds as if she will never understand and does not care how much pain you are in or the potential repercussions of her lack of care for her childrens health. Abominable neglect on the part of a mother
19739,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Same. I had shingles last year. They were all over my face scalp and neck. Horrible.
19740,RSV vaccine?: I was not able to get it while pregnant because it was too early in the season. So my 8 week old got it yesterday. She cried for maybe three seconds and then was normal the rest of the day. Very grateful to get it
19741,Younghealthy shingles experience: Good for you I Am glad you did not suffer much. Its probably due to your age but I do not understand why you even got shingles at your age. Unfortunately that is not my experience. I Am 63 and I Am on day 38 of extreme pain. For about four days in a row my back hurt near my kidneys and I kept hoping it would go away but it did not so I finally said yes to my son who kept asking me to please go to the ER. The day after that I woke up with a rash. My doctor gave me antivirals. I forgot to mention that one month before I broke out in the rash I had gotten my first of two shingles vaccines. I was told if I had not gotten the first one it would be worse now. I do not believe that it could be worse. I can barely see the rash but the pain is still there. I have no energy so my son has been taking care of me and doing a great job. A few days ago I felt a little better and found some hope in that. But then the next day the pain was back to being as bad as it was. I have two red spots on my very light rash but it feels like the whole rash still has open sores. The doctor says its nerve damage. I do not know how I can feel this way for so long and not be crazy. Or who knows maybe I am. I almost forgot to mention that I am taking all kinds of supplements that have been suggested including vitamin C and D3. I hope everyone else has an experience like yours
19742,Put me out of my misery.: I did Covid in 1 arm and shingles in the other. Learn from my mistake and do not do that dude Shingles shots are not a joke and plan to be down for a couple days after. Good news we only need them every 5 years
19743,Shingles vaccine experience: I never had any reaction but the sore arm after both my shots. No biggie. Worth it to not get fucking shingles.
19747,A great big MAGA science experiment Trumps health agency choices shock medical professionals: You are lucky before the vaccine was available my healthy father died within 2 weeks of getting covid and my mother spent 6 weeks in the hospital and never recovered. It was devastating for our family
19748,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I did not get chickenpox from a party but from good ole preschool. Of course I brought it home to my six month old sister at the time. I just remember my Mom being very unhappy about the entire predicament. In the end I got shingles earlier this year. I am mid30's. It was painful and sucked. The burning nerve pain was the worst.
19751,41 and got Shingles: I had them at 32. It was excruciating
19752,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I Am scared. I get really sick after vaccines and I Have heard this one is the worst. I Have had shingles when I was 15 somehow so I fully understand the risk but Ill have to plan time off from work because I Am certain I will be sick for at least 3 days after. COVID gets me for 2 days.
19753,Hello all I am no stranger to misc skin issues...ongoing painful cystic hormonal acne face have been diagnosed with bodyscalp psoriasis since 14 and even had shingles twice before 30 About a week ago I discovered a very large very painful bump by my armpit. It looked like a deep pimple but much more painful. After a day or 2 with no change in appearance but more pain. I got a little nervous breast cancer? and set a derm appt. Since then I have had about 1015 of these huge painful lumps appear in both armpits some are clustered 23 lumps. None of them have come to a head believe me I tried to pop them...I know it is bad. The pain is so bad I can barely lift my arms above my head or sleep on my side. I have even been taking Advil to relieve the pain. This is when I started looking onlinereddit to figure what the hell is happening. After finding this sub and looking through some pictures I am thinking that this may be what I have. The only thing is most of your stories have the common theme that you have been suffering from HS since your teens and earlier. I have had an occasional cyst near my privates every few months I get a large cystic pimple or 2 on my face but none this painful high quantity or in the clusters that are happening in my pits. It seems bizarre to me that this is happening for the very first time for me at 33 years old?? Is there anyone else here who had their first HS flare up at 30? And any advice followup questions are welcome. Thank you
19758,Spravato Journey A Year in Review October 5 2023 October 5 2024 October 5 2023 My first Spravato treatment was amazing I felt like a grain of sand on a beach with time as the ocean washing over me. My body dissolved into nothingness leaving me as pure consciousness floating through a white void. It was an outofbody experience lasting 2030 minutes. October 10 2023 Treatment two was not as groundbreaking. I felt rushed and the experience was short and unsatisfactory. October 12 2023 During treatment three I brought up feeling rushed. The staff reassured me they were still learning and I appreciated the honest conversation. I had a good trip. October 17 2023 Today's session was good. My insight was that my sister is incredibly strong and compassionate though she hides it. Were just molecules but the force behind those molecules shapes who we are. October 19 2023 A powerful trip today led to the realization that deep down I am a good person. However during the session someone popped bubble wrap and it was overwhelming. Spravato amplifies sounds making even small noises unbearable. October 24 2023 Spravato hit hard today. The takeaway we are more than the sum of our parts. Were complex molecules but something deeper drives us. October 26 2023 A shorter trip today but a great conversation about how Spravato has helped my social anxiety. I also reflected on a past experience where I was not supported during a panic attack making me grateful for the compassion I now see in the staff. October 31 2023 Were complex collections of organic molecules. Though we have not yet unlocked lifes secrets I realize that we never truly die. Our molecules are simply disassembled and scattered back into the universe. After all we are made of stars. November 2 2023 A mild relaxing experience today. November 7 2023 Drama and a panic attack today but it ended with laughter. On a positive note I Have lost weightnow down to 272 lbs from 282 lbs. November 9 2023 Spravato hit me hard but mellowed out. November 14 2023 A mild session today. The room was quiet. My insight water is the most valuable and useful molecule in the universe. November 16 2023 An incredible experience. I could feel electrons and magnetic fields. I visualized particles being pushed away in an explosive release. It was one of the most amazing sensations I Have ever had. November 21 2023 A mild session but I had a good talk about social anxiety. I Am learning to navigate spaces like Target with more ease. November 22 2023 We are drops of water in the vast ocean of spacetime. I contemplated our existencewhy are we here? How did this all begin? November 28 2023 Spravato hit hard but the comedown was funny. I laughed so much I cried November 30 2023 Another hardhitting session but I enjoyed talking and laughing with the staff. We discussed my positive review of the clinic. December 5 2023 Todays treatment was quiet and mellow but it hit hard. December 7 2023 Spravato hit very hard today. I learned more about the staff and had fun conversations about marijuana prices in Missouri. I Am starting new meds tonight and stopping Wellbutrin. December 12 2023 A mild experience possibly because I Am on new meds Auvelity. December 19 2023 Another mild session today. December 20 2023 Stopped taking Auvelity due to side effects like restless legs and shingles pain. December 21 2023 I weighed in at 272 lbs today. Spravato was mild likely due to coming off Auvelity. December 26 2023 Holy hell Spravato hit me four times harder than my first session. I felt like I died and went to the center of the galaxy. December 28 2023 A normal session but I experienced electrons again. My insight was The power you put in is the power you get out. January 2 2024 A different very mild session today. I was awake the whole time. January 4 2024 We talked about reducing my treatments to once a week in February to begin tapering off. I weighed in at 275 lbs. January 9 2024 A mild session. Weather caused some delays with transportation. January 16 2024 I had a lot of social anxiety before today's session. I Am unsure how Spravato is working on my anxiety nowmaybe it requires more realworld exposure to other people. January 18 2024 A normal session weight at 273.5 lbs. January 23 2024 Another routine session. January 25 2024 Today hit me differently. I felt heavily under the influence afterward. Weight 275 lbs. February 1 2024 Weight is up to 277 lbs. Spravato made me feel really drunk today. February 6 2024 Got extremely high and stayed under the effects even after returning home. I feel like I Have plateaued with these treatments. February 7 2024 I felt uncomfortable in the treatment room today. The staff did not set a timer and I left early while still under the influence which left me uneasy. February 15 2024 Weighed in at 269 lbs though I doubt the scales accuracy. I Have been on a plateau since midJanuary. February 22 2024 I got really high again today which was a nice change from recent milder sessions. February 29 2024 Feeling swelling in my joints again. Had an interesting conversation about mushrooms today. Still on a plateau. March 7 2024 Joint pain is increasing as I Am on a lower dose of Spravato. Weight 261 lbs. March 14 2024 A mild session today but I felt very drunk afterward. My joint pain is increasing. March 21 2024 Discussed tapering down my treatments to twice a month and eventually once a month before stopping. March 28 2024 There was confusion with my scheduling today. I ended up waiting outside for over an hour before being picked up. Spravato hit me hard and I felt really drunk afterward. April 4 2024 More scheduling issues but I finally made it to my appointment. Spravato hit hard again. The staff acted strangely today but I put my foot down and confirmed that May 2 will be my final treatment. April 18 2024 Todays treatment hit me hard but it was good overall. My final appointment is still set for May 2. April 22 2024 My BrotherinLaw passed away I will extend my treatments for another 6 months. May 9 2024 After my final May 2 appointment I decided to extend my treatments for six more months every two weeks. May 23 2024 Todays session got me incredibly high. I felt like I was communicating with a spiritual entitypossibly God the same light I experienced during a THC trip. June 6 2024 I Am dealing with the passing of my brotherinlaw and its been emotional. I Am considering returning to therapy. July 11 2024 I Have been on a digital detox for the last six months. Today I noticed how much people are addicted to their phonesespecially during treatment. It reaffirmed my decision to reduce distractions in my life. August 8 2024 I had a breakthrough moment today. I realized that humans make mistakes and when we know better we must forgive those mistakes. I forgave my parents. I also contemplated how energy and matter are the samethey form an infinite cycle and I want my ashes to eventually scatter across the globe carried by water. August 9 2024 I Have been reflecting on the universe as an equation combining the Big Bang life and infinity. Its all interconnected. September 15 2024 Recent sessions have been normal and uneventful. October 5 2024 Its been a year on Spravato. I Have moved to treatments every three weeks and will continue until January 2025. Reflection This year has been transformative filled with both deep insights and struggles. Spravato has helped in ways I did not expectimproving depression social anxiety and even physical pain. However the journey was not without challenges. There were moments of discomfort
19759,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: I had it on my head. Worked through all of it. At least when your working you not just sitting around thinking about how much that crap hurts. This was 5 years ago and I still get weird sensations in the area where I had it.
19760,Effectiveness of rsv vaccineantibodies? Nurses have you noticed less admissions from babies that received this?: Not sure of effectiveness as we have not been exposed that I know of but I will tell you my twins got rsv when they were 8 months 6 months adjusted and it was absolutely terrifying and resulted in a hospital stay and years with an inhaler for one twin. I jumped at the chance to get the vaccine when I was pregnant and then my newborn just got it right after birth in October. Anything I can do to avoid that scary situation
19761,Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Me too and my arm has been so painful hot and a little swollen. But I understand shingles are crazy painful so yay us
19762,Id rather have shingles than GuillainBarr Syndrome a known adverse reaction with the shingles jab. My motherinlaws cousin is dying with GBS. She got the flu shot mandatory for nursessad
19763,Booty hole Shingles: Yeah I Have got to pain clinics and all that. Acupuncture helped a bit. I used to have numbness all the way down my left leg into my heel and that for the most part went away. I Have tried all different creams that pain specialist tried but burns in the sensitive area. Injections was not recommended as it would most likely because loss of bowel control. I Have been doing vitamin supplements like aloe and turmeric multi vitamin homeopathic remedies etc just a waiting game at this point
19764,Diagnosed today.: Sorry you are going through this. Shingles can be incredibly painful and unfortunately can last for a while. Similar as others have shared mine started out with a headache a few days before I even saw the first blister. Around the third day I started seeing red blisterlike rash on my neck and then all over my right scalp and right ear. Antiviral meds Vancyclovir? helped turn the blisters into scabs. I also was prescribed gabapentin for the pain but acupuncture ended up being more effective for me anyway. As someone else mentioned ice packet also helped when the pain was at its worst.
19767,39 F 170 cm I have had shingles twice now once at 21 and again at 39. This last round was excruciating and left significant scarring. I have asked my doc about the vaccine. She pointed out that it has not been tested on my age group under 50 but she said she will approve it if I want to take the risk. I have other autoimmune disorders as well including hi dr aden it is sup pur at iv a and psoriasis so my immune system is commonly compromised. I really want to avoid going through shingles again if I can but only if it is not too risky. Does anyone know the risks of the vaccine in those under 50?
19769,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Interesting read I had some itching and blisters pop up on my left side stomach and went to the doctor to check it out. She looked at it and said it was hives but now I really think it was shingles.
19770,Shingles vaccine: I Have had both shots with no side effects.
19771,Shingles Is NO Joke: Mine was on the back of my thigh and it hurt to sit down. I wondered if I caught something like ringworm. Then came the flu symptoms with body aches. Two doctors at my GPs told me I must have a high pain tolerance. But I was already taking gabapentin and it helped. When it feels like its coming back I use Valtrex.
19772,Neighbor thinks FEMA is great 750 is for food only. Friend after 4 shots hemorrhaging in one eye now got shingle shot and now wants to get the pneumonia one Tired of talking to people. Batshit crazy everywhere
19785,Mom guilt.... We have had an extreme amount of stress going on with our family. Apparently my body said enough is enough and I was diagnosed with Ocular shingles yesterday Christmas Eve morning. My 2yo had the vaccine for chicken pox but my 10 month old has not yet. I cannot hold change or feed my little man which in and of itself is horrible. But I also ruined our last Christmas together for a few years. We could not attend Christmas due to elderly risk people in attendance. I am fine with that I would never want to pass it on. And today I had to miss my husband's side of the family with his grandparents in their 90s because again high risk but my husband and kids got to go. I am so mad at myself for being so weak to not control my PPD PPA and stress levels to the point I am missing this stuff. I know it is not my fault but as a mom you want their first and third Christmas to be magically and perfect. Has anyone else gone through something like this? It will just be me and my kids the next few years unfortunately. I could use some virtual hugs
19787,My dad lived 8 years with the long term nerve pain from a shingles infection. I cannot describe how terrible his suffering was. I got vaccinated as soon as I could. I had a reaction like you but I would do it again to protect myself from a shingles infection.
19789,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I never got chickenpox even though my sister had it. Was able to get vaccinated at 35.
19791,Yeah one of the doses cannot remember if it was the first or second really sidelined me. And I had virtually NO reaction to any of the COVID vaccine I got. Console yourself with the fact that you are two and done for life with Shingrix. and singles is excruciatingly painful.
19792,I had shingles last year it is a very miserable occurrence. I got the vaccine afterwards it did hurt but there is no comparison to the hurt of shingles.
19797,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles in my early 30s. It was on my scalp one side of my face and one eyelid. Developed a small blister on the eyelid and when I recovered I discovered that area where the blister was no longer has any eyelashes. Thankfully its a small area and not that noticeable. I remember the doctor being concerned about my eye and I was monitored and put on medication.
19798,I gave a swim lesson to a newly vaccine child he had come straight from Walgreens with the bandaid still on his arm and the next day I got shingles.
19799,Shingles vaccine: I got shingles 2 flu and hep B shots all at the same time. Other than some pain near the shingles shot I had zero side effects.
19803,Shingrix One  Done?: I felt run down achy feverish last night but I got some sleep and feel better not great today. I noticed my heart rate was elevated while sleeping.
19807,Is the antiviral a MUST?: Your shingles outbreak will clear up eventually without antivirals however the likelihood of permanent nerve damage is high without antivirals to halt the flare. Also if your outbreak in on the face you risk permanent eye damage even blindness. The pills are large but if you cannot swallow them easily take them with something thick like pudding or a milkshake. If it were closer to Christmas I would suggest eggnog. I was a late diagnosis during my first bout of shingles suffered nerve damage and have since had eleven relapses. Nerve damage is one of the things that makes you more susceptible to another bout of shingles. Believe me take those antivirals. I was a week in when I started them and now I feel like the poster girl for shingles.
19813,My God. I thought the Covid shots were bad. This Shingrix shingles vaccine is pure HELL. And I Am reading that the second dose of it is even worse. I have never been so sick in my life and that is saying something.
19815,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I had just gotten over a horrible virus that put me in the hospital. Once I got better my mom immediately sent me to a friends house to get the chicken pox because my immune system was shot. I got a beanie baby out of it though.
19818,Exposing Covid Vaccine Trials  Shane Smith Has Questions w Brianne Dressen: Brienne Dressen a mother who volunteered for a COVID19 vaccine trial claims the vaccine left her permanently disabled sparking controversy about the safety of rushed vaccine approvals. She is now suing astrazeneca and cofounded React 19 to expose the hidden dangers of vaccine trials questioning the government's and pharmaceutical companies' transparency. The conversation blasts the manipulation of information during the pandemic accusing authorities of downplaying adverse reactions and silencing those with concerns fueling a growing distrust in vaccine safety and the broader public health response.
19822,"My Vaccine Experience & Research on Shingles: I received my 2nd vaccine (Moderna) in May and developed Shingles within a couple weeks. As a healthy non-immunocompromised 40 year old male, I was interested in if it could be related to the vaccine and have done some research on it on the side. It is disappointing to see some of the media stories that try to depict adverse reactions to the vaccine as a means for anti-vax ends. I believe it's important to note that there are adverse reactions being reported that appear to have both temporal and feasible biological linkages. It is not abnormal to expect these things to happen and not necessarily a reason to avoid the vaccine, but something to be aware of. Further medical research is needed to confirm and document more thoroughly which will take time. I am posting links and snippets for easy consumption. I personally believe that the vaccine is still worth it for me and would do it again and encourage others to get the vaccine. The reason I wanted to post this is to share early research on possible relationships with shingles to the vaccine and to facilitate more accurate reporting. I was originally told by my doctor that my shingles was not related to the vaccine. However, upon research and talking to my physician father I have found that any adverse health event within 3-4 weeks of a vaccine shot is considered a possible linkage. As a result, I think people should be aware of this so that databases can be updated with more accurate data. This will help the medical community further research possible linkages, better understand them, and as one study notes, take steps if necessary to ""minimize risks to vaccinated individuals.""

19827,I had a terrible case of shingles starting on January 26 of this year. The rash is long gone and most of the pain but I have postherpetic neuralgia and still have some pain mostly at night. What is the recommendation for getting the vaccine? How long after complete healing? or does it need complete healing?. I have been horrified to learn you can get it more than once I do NOT want a repeat. This was the worst physical thing I have ever been through by far. Thanks in advance for your answers.
19830,anyone else about to get their first shingles vaccine?: I got my first dose a couple of weeks ago. For me it was uneventful
19833,Shingles vaccine experience: I had shingles. It was the worst thing ever. I then got the shots and had no problems at all.
19834,What Is your visitor plans? RSV season newborns: Have you gotten the RSV vaccine? If not probably something to look into especially since you are specifically worried about RSV. Baby reaps the benefits of the vaccine given to mom and for me who has a toddler in daycare who already got RSV last year when he was 3 it was an absolute no brainer to be able to offer some protection to my newborn. He was just born a few days ago and thankfully it saved me from having to give him another shot because I had done it already.
19835,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: It was not and I had it horribly. I believe my younger brother from 87 got the vaccine though not certain.
19837,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: Stop projecting you are just embarrassed you got vaccine It is okay Jesus loves you
19838,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Yeah I had Shingles in my left eye at age 50. It was awful The Rx pain meds did nothing and the antiviral made me throw up which I never do. When I get sick which is rare it tends to take me out completely.
19843,How was people's experience with Shringrix. At second day now with sore joints and fatigue. Is that normal? Another jab in six months 300 aud per jab.
19852,Did you know there was a rise in shingles in those that got vaccinated? Yet another side effect of getting vaccinated. Reminds me of my mother getting the shingles vaccine and then getting shingles 3 times so far. WTF HUH?
19855,More than half of you.S. newborns are vaccinated for RSV: Just to clarify I am absolutely not advocating for babies to not get it my 7 month old daughter has gotten it. I am saying that there are currently no plans for Beyfortus availability to be extended to 3yearolds.
19856,If you have you gotten the shingles vaccine where and how much did it cost?: Got a mild case at 44 luckily did not affect me much
19858,Hi everyone. I was just diagnosed today after 3 days of one of the worst headaches of my life. I noticed the lymph node in front and behind my left ear were swollen on the second day of the headache and began to have awful shooting pains above my left eye. I did not really know what to expect when I went to the urgent care because this is not a normal headache for me. After describing my symptoms the doctor was ready to refer me to a neurologist when she noticed some bumps on my forehead and a little redness further into my scalp. She said she thought it was shingles since I am 43 and had varicella as a kid. I took my first dose of valtrex 3 hours ago and I am just waiting it out. Has anyone else presented with headeye pain? It does not feel like the sharp neuralgia that is described by Dr Google.
19860,Did you have a strong reaction to both Shingles doses?: I did not make it to the shingles vaccine phase. I got shingles at 47 and it was the worst pain I have ever had in my life. I have given birth three times once unmedicated and also have had a hysterectomy. what I am saying is the pain level is off the charts. You feel like you are being electrocuted from the inside out and then when it starts healing the scabs make you want to tear your skin off. Just get the vaccine if you have that option.
19861,Shingles. Get your damn shot.: I got it at 34 apparently COVID led pretty directly to it being more common in people under 50. Literally the worst month of my life.
19862,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: My son had the chicken pox vaccine when he was a baby he is now 18 and he got shingles last year.
19863,Yeah so.. not really quite sure how this happened. My boyfriend had a shingles outbreak for the first time in his life and went on medication to treat it. He suffered for a few weeks but it did keep lowering in intensity throughout. He was not in any severe pain or agony but was very uncomfortable and pain was present. All good ...I thought. Cut to four or five days ago when I noticed a rash on my upper left chest. It looked exactly like his shingles. Shit. Then I noticed throughout the day that my shirt was irritating my back in a certain spot. I went downstairs and asked my boyfriend we live together to check my back and he said I had a rash and pointed to exactly where my irritation was. Shit. I definitely have shingles. I went to my doctor to confirm and yup.. it is shingles. I asked how is this possible when you cannot infect someone with shingles just chickenpox? He did not have a clear answer but said he has seen it happen before. I know coincidence is possible but what the hell lol. Anyway.. holy fuck this sucks. I keep asking my boyfriend if my symptoms are normal or anything that he experienced because I just feel rather sick. It is not the most sick I have ever been but I simply do not feel good. I have low persistent nausea low grade pervasive headaches general abdomen aches and pains that are not too painful but i can feel them.. like.. should I really be feeling this poorly? I am on an antiviral and it worked well for my boyfriend so I am hoping to recover on a similar path. Is there anything I should look out for if it starts getting worse? I have never had shingles before.
19865,Hospitalized in 2020 with Covid. Took 4 months to recovernever fully recovered. Docs said I would die without vaccine if I ever caught it again. Reluctantly I got vaccine Now I Have had shingles 5 times covid 4 times constant rapid heart rate on meds to help high BP inflam disk
19866,Comedian says she is Double vaccine booster Flu shot I took the Shingles Shot too then says Jesus loves her the most and then collapses on stage.: The title explains exactly what happened.
19868,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yeah me and my one brother got the pox. Youngest brother got the vaccine.
19869,NOTE This post is not seeking direct medical adviceanswers to the medical questions in of themselves. Instead this post is moreso directed at whether anyone has any recommendations on what I should do andor direction to any resources that might help answer these questions i.e. how do I find good pulmonologist who speaks english and Spanish as I do not speak Spanish. Honestly I realize my efforts to do anything here might be futile so seeing if anyone has had a similiar experience and how they dealt with it emotionally or otherwise. x200B Background As per the title my dad is in Spain at the moment and he got infected with COVID19 and is seriously ill mid 70s M 6'2ft up to date on vaccinations for COVID19 RSV flu etc. 220 pounds their condition is active COVID19 serious breathing trouble hypoxia pneumonia and likely other issues as they are going through ongoing tests right now Timeline of Events 1.My parents US doctor prescribed them Paxlovid prior to my dad and mom traveling to Spain. My parents also got the most recent round of COVID19 boosters for older adults about 4 weeks ago. 2. They both tested positive for COVID19 on Wednesday April 24 with a molecular Lucira COVID19 and Flu AB test and they both started taking their 5day course of Paxlovid. They also saw a rural doctor in Spain who prescribed them 5 other medications for my dad to take as his COVID infection was much more severe than my moms. However I cannot figure out if these medications are worthwhile for COVID19 andor if they are contraindicated with Paxlovid since its all in Spanish. This includes the following medications 1. Levofloxcico 2. Varidasa 3. Paracetamol 4. Flutox Jarabe 5. Vontolin. After asking on some other Reddit boards and doing some research myself it seems to be the case that there is no information on any interactions between these drugs and Paxlovid no information available suggesting there is indeed an interaction or no interactions so no information either good or bad. However I assume someone with a medical background might know whether these might be a contraindication risk due to their general drug classes. Got in contact with a US based pulmonologist. who suggested that he stop taking varidasadrug 2 which he did not sure if this caused things to get better or worse or if he would have gotten worse regardless and that he might have hypoxia and thus likely cannot flybe flown to Madrid or back to US given his current condition not sure if this meant only airplane travel or if helicopter travel to Madrid is also barred due to hypoxia. Given that my parents just recently got new COVID vaccine boosters started Paxlovid course immediately after feeling ill and testing positive I Am not sure why my dad is so sick already yes he is very old yes I understand vaccines are not sterilizing etc.. I have a partial concern that these 5 other random drugs this rural doctor prescribed now 4 as of this morning might be making things worse since Paxlovid is quite harsh on the kidneysliver and all these other drugs may be adding no additional health benefit and instead are just increasing overall toxicity andor interfering with Paxlovid. Obviously this thought process could just be unconscious biasseeking something to blame here and is not rational consideration. 3. My Dads condition worsened on Friday April 26 and taken to a small rural hospital in Andjar Spain he needed to go to the nearest one AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. This is where my mom and dad currently arewhere my dad was admitted. My mom is sick with COVID19 as well but her condition is nowhere near as bad so she is trying to coordinate things and communicate to me status updates. I believe he is now on oxygen and getting various tests. Pulse oximeter denotes low oxygen levels and they are running other tests. Confirmed he has pneumonia and are starting IV antibiotics. 4. My dad started his 5day Paxlovid course Wednesday so he theoretically should be done with it Sunday or Monday I Am fearing that if he is already in this bad of a state with the added buffer of Paxlovid interfering with viral replication I cannot imagine what the likely COVID rebound situation will be on Sunday or Monday when he completes the course andor whether he can even get an additional package of Paxlovid in Spain assuming a doctor would recommend that he do that again toxicity might be too high as is. Not sure what is liver AST enzymes are at the moment. Main Requests So I guess my ask here is that I am seeking any SpainbasedSpanish Speaking individuals who can advise on a. Good pulmonologist andor other relevant medical expert somewhat near Andjar Spain or who is in another part of Spain who can help with advice feel free to DM me if appropriate. Or any recommendation for a goodlarger hospital around Andjar Spain since they likely cannot make it all the way to Madrid which is 4 hours away where big academic hospitals are. b. the following medications 1. Levofloxcico 2. Varidasa 3. Paracetamol 4. Flutox Jarabe 5. Vontolin. There appears to be no information on whether they interact negatively with Paxlovid. Also not sure if these medications are good for COVID19 andor if there are other medications available in Spain people might recommend as I am not sure if Paxlovid is available in Spain or at least this part of Spain. He stopped taking drug 2.Varidasa as explained above as per telehealth conversation with good pulmonologist in US but not sure if that is the correct course obviously doctors know best but it may be the case that a US doctor would recommend against this medication simply because they do not know what it is and its unclear if there is a US analog. Other Requests c. Any good recommendations on how to go about dealing with Spanish to English language barrier? I only speak English and am based in USA but it seems all the medical staff at this small hospital speak Spanish only so not sure how to communicate and coordinate with them and not sure how to get medical records from US doctors sent to Spain doctors so they can use it. Basically looking for a doctor med student etc. in this area or some kind of app paid translation services etc. who speaks Spanish and English and who can serve gap between the language barrier here. d. Any other suggestions on how to handle this situation? Maybe calling US embassy or something? Maybe they can help figure out how to transfer health records from US to Spain since I assume HIPAA will be an issue? Really not sure what to do. Concluding Thoughts Apologies in advance if this breaks any rules andor is quite an unreasonable ask......not sure what else to do at this stage as I am an ocean away and my passport is expiredI Am stuck in USA my sister is likely able to get to Spainwhere they are in next 48 hours as her passport is not expired since she travels a lot admittedly not sure there is much either of us can do as we are not medical persons. While my mother is with him and does speak some Spanish it seems her COVID19 infection while not hospitalizing her is giving her brain fog making her extremely tired and so she is having a hard time conversing with parties here. I love my father and absolutely cannot let him pass like this if allowed under this subreddits rules I can pay if needed to get help here andor donate to charity of ones choosing or something else that is allowable as I realize this is quite a remote part of Spain and a rather lengthy and complicated ask. Please help me I Am desperate and not sure what to do here this feels like a perfect storm of everything going wrong all at once.
19873,Anyone Under 50 got their shingles vaccine: I did at 48. I kicked and scream at the clinic and my primary. I had shingles and did not want to get it again.
19874,New Shingrix data demonstrate 100 vaccine efficacy in the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over in China: prod rome syndromes My outbreaks are literally over lapping back to back to back to back. Never ending.
19876,41 and got Shingles: I did at 32 it was awful. I did not even know what shingles was
19878,Hi I Am 25 and I was diagnosed with AS this year. My pain has been worse and my inflammation has increased. My Dr. wants to switch to Rinvoq after being on Humira but I am very nervous about it. I also have very high anxiety going through some medication troubles with ADHD and anxiety meds right now and am very nervous about taking Rinvoq. I know I should talk to my dr about it but the thought of doing that is spiking my anxiety so high right now and I feel like I should have asked sooner. But here I am. Apologies if these questions are silly or cannot be answered on here 1. One of the side effects listed is changes in mental state. Did anyone experience this? I mentioned I am already having complications with that from other medication so I Am nervous about that. 2. Have you experienced weight gain on this medication? My last medication also caused me to gain a good amount of weight and I Am already struggling to get that off. 3. Did you all get sick from the shingles shot? Have any side effects from that? 4. Does Rinvoq make you immunocompromised? Should I be more cautious with avoiding getting sick? This one might just be for Dr 5. What side effects did you experience from Rinvoq? How long did you go away? My Dr mentioned acne as a big one. Thank you for anyone who took the time to read this I Am sorry if these questions are dumb and if you just tell me to shut up and talk to my dr I understand.
19879,If you had chicken pox as a child you need to know this.: Got shingles last year I Am 34 now. I had a mild case lower back then around my upper thigh. Got acyclovir pretty early on. Pain was still horrible and it was hard to walk. Gabapentin helped quite a lot.
19881,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: Get the vaccine do not put it off. I planned on getting mine and forgot about the timing I got that shit in my eye on my face head arm and body. I was diagnosed three months ago and the Post Her pet ic Neuralgia still hurts.
19884,Shingles? WTF? How long before I can run hard and compete?: Shingles is awful but in my experience you bounce back fairly quickly. I had shingles over the last new year. For me it was a week of the most debilitating and miserable illness I have ever had followed by a couple months of consistently poor sleep due to postherpetic neuralgia. I had a somewhat debilitating case of Covid for the first time a week or so after the onset shingles too and still do not feel like I was out too long or impacted very much. Though this was winter and I was running to maintain fitness for spring. In other words not in the middle of a training block hoping to see progressionimprovement every few weeks as I suppose you are OP. Overall for me energy levels returned quickly but the disruption to my sleep was the biggest challenge to overcome. If you have nerve pain make sure you get put on gabapentin.
19886,Still in pain from vaginal shingles when does it end?: Oh my I am sorry. I had 1010 pain Friday last week no kidding but thankfully it did not elevate my blood pressure. Up until day 8 the pain radiated down to my toes. I thought it was unrelated. I hope the pain would not come back for you
19888,I am curious how many of us caught chicken pox the oldfashioned way and how many of us were vaccinated? And what year were you born for reference?: I am a '96 millennial and I was vaccinated so I have never had it My siblings are millennials born before me. My middle sister caught it at school and gave it to everyone else. In 2020 my boyfriend developed shingles and the doctor told him he could potentially give me chicken pox from it regardless of whether or not I was vaccinated
19892,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: There is a vaccine? There was not when I was a kid. You caught it suffered and had at least one scar somewhere from a bad sore mine is right between my eyes. I am glad they have a vaccine now but they did not in the 80s that is for sure.
19894,Shingles vaccine: I got the first shot two weeks ago on a Friday so I could recover over the weekend and was perfectly fine. That being said I never get vaccine reactions minus a sore arm so the lack of a reaction to shot 1 was not a surprise. Ill get shot 2 in January and will again get it on a Friday just in case. Hopefully your reaction will be minimal to nonexistent
19900,Shingles Vaccine: I got all of those vaccines plus an MMR booster prior to my first infusion a couple years ago and I HIGHLY recommend not getting them all at the same time! The Shingrex vaccine on its own made me feel pretty bad for a couple of days. Like the flu. The pneumonia and flu shots weren't bad and I even did those at the same time. too bad for me. The Covid vaccines make me feel like crap for a day or so. I spaced Shingrex and the Covid vaccine about a week apart.
19901,Shingles: I am 32 and had shingles for Halloween and now I am dealing with breast cancer. Life is seriously so unfair and my body is going through changes I would have never expected. All of this to say it sucks that they will not accommodate the vaccine for you seeing has though you had it. The medical world makes zero sense sometimes
19902,Motherinlaw 56F deliberately infected my 27F daughter 1F with chickenpox. I am livid. She does not think it is a big deal: Ooof. For me the first patch appeared on my hip and it had been feeling tender. I thought my senstive skin was reacting to my laundry detergent again. I went to work. Three hours later the patch had gone about the size of a small coin to the size of a cd. I called my doctor to get some strong antihistamines or something. By the time my doc appointment rolled around another 5 hours later they would spread across my spine. The doc took one look and said yeah that is shingles pop some ibuprofen when it hurts and take the rest of the week off work it was a thursday and I worked in close proximity with three then pregnant women. By the time Monday rolled round I had not slept they would spread across my stomach and down my leg and were about an inch and a half away from linking up on my other hip. I saw a different doctor who yelled at me for not taking my antivirals prescription only to discover I would never been prescribed the antivirals. This new doctor was reluctant to offer any other pain relief and suggested I could still return to work... I requested a second opinion. A third doctor was brought in said that it was one of the worst cases of shingles she would ever seen prescribed me codiene and another two weeks off work. An investigation was launched and neither of the other doctors are practicing medicine anymore. I have permanent scars and constant backache centralised on the shingles site on my spine. I think I would also rather drip lemon juice in eyes and sit on a cactus than have shingles again. F shingles. And f my crappy doctors and your crappy doctors for suggesting it was herpes. F'ers.
19905,Video on Dystonia: What is CMV? I Am desperate this is in my driving leg and foot. So is Dystonia a herpes virus? Its so weird after i got the shingles shot this all happened . I Am 54 and was advised to get the shingles shot. Will the Dystonia go in remission like the HSV 12 does?
19909,Vaccine?: I had my third bout of shingles in June of 2021 it was ROUGH Burned my 2nd and last that year week of vacation over it. Got the vacc when I was cleared up. No shingles since and had to nurse hubby through a bout one spot the size of a large grape mine was midline front to midline back with huge blisters. I have a coworker who is been having little outbreaks all over her body for weeks now ugh
19910,I almost lost 2 teeth to shingles.: I Am so sorry. Shingles is a nightmare. I had it back in March and my eyebrow and forehead are still numb. I think that Job in The Bible had Shingles. The Bible never identifies it as Shingles but in my heart I know that is what Job had. So much suffering. Get Well soon. My heart goes out to you.
19912,Shingles vaccine: Was vaccinated with Shingrex and had no problems other than an ouchy arm. Two of my family developed shingles and had a terrible time. Very painful. In comparison a couple injections and sore arm are not a big deal.
19916,Today I found out Shingles can look like poison ivy: Oof I did this too. I felt like I had the flu for almost exactly 48 hours.
19917,Shingles with PHN after: I am sorry. That is awful that happened to you. I think the craziest thing which I am sure you understand is like you know someone who is a burn victim is going to have excruciating pain. It is weird when your body starts sending pain signals like that. The only way I could describe it is it starts out like when you get soap in your eye then like 3 seconds later that is when the really intense burning and tightening pain begins. I sometimes could feel an attack coming like 5 minutes before. Sometimes if i could fall asleep while this was all going on it would take about an hour for me to get my eye open and then an attack would happen. Another thing that happened was my dog died right at the height of it. I had her for 12 years and she was the best dog. I swear I think she knew I was in bad pain because I was in the middle of a bad attack and she just collapsed and died 10 minutes later. Literally the worst month of my life. I am sorry you have neuralgia. Hopefully you can find a way to manage and maybe at some point the medical community figures out a way to fix it. Thank you for what you said. I appreciate it
19919,I waited to get the covid vaccine but even then that was not long enough time to see the side effects. I ended up with inflammation gastrointestinal issues that led to intolerance to most common foods four episodes of shingles. We were lied to.
19923,RSVP vaccine and others: My baby got it at 5 months. We all got super sick including my toddler and she was almost fine. We were dying sick in bed while she was fine. get it
19924,31 yr old male: You poor thing. That was too much at one time. I break up my flu and covid boosters because I know that would be too much. I cannot imagine all 3 at once. They did not do you any favors. I D wish they would say you can get them together but I would not suggest it. Ironically the boosters could be the solution or could make you much better just not at the same time People with both long covid and chronic shingles often improve after getting vaccines and boosters. They do tend to feel rough with fever chills etc. for a day or two though. I am weird because I am happy when I have side effects after a vaccine or booster because I know for sure my immune system is doing what it is supposed to do and building a solid defense. I feel for you. I have a few chronic autoimmune illnesses they now know are likely caused by viruses. We are learning a whole category of illnesses are likely all post viral syndromes. We have not respected viruses nearly enough historically. If there is one good thing we learned from COVID it is that viruses do not just clear the system and can wreak all sorts of havoc for a lifetime. Hopefully MRNA vaccines for all those viruses will be available soon.
19930,RSV Shot: We got it a couple weeks ago for our 4month old. He cried for the needle but calmed down pretty quick and had no after effects that I noticed  not even much of a sore leg. It is given me a lot more peace of mind taking him out places during sick season
19931,HPV Virus Ruining my Life as a transplant recipient.: I totally sympathize with you. After my second transplant I started having precancerous grade 3 cells pop up and have had more laser ablations than I can count I literally have lost count I think at least a dozen at this point. The doctor actually suggested a hysterectomy because the constant laser ablations caused so much scar tissue that she could not always detect the bad cells which I had in 2018. Then it started cropping on my anus. So I have to go to a separate apt for that and have those burned off. Since I am currently on dialysis and on the lowest level of immunosuppressants I will probably ever be on the transplant team recommended I get the HPV vaccine series of 3 shots. So far so good my last check had only level 2 VIN2 cells.
19933,Ouch the Shingles shot hurt like hell.
19934,Because of shingles other than stress?: My 2ed shingles outbreak since 2022. 1st time I took the covid  flu shot together and within 3 days I had shingles. Currently at tail end of 2ed time  received flu shot sure enough 10 hours later shingles arrived Between 2022  2024 I did get my shingles vaccination.
19936,Had shingles twice. I got the vaccine now. No one wants shingles I have nerve damage from it also.
19937,This is FICTION not fact: The first time I got both at once I did one in each arm. It almost immediately felt like a mistake and everyone I talked to said they preferred getting both in the same arm. The next time I got both in the same arm and it did not like double up the pain in that one arm like I thought it would it was definitely the better way to go to me.
19940,"Just got the Shingrix vaccine and I'm curious to hear about others' experiences. What side effects did you have, if any? Has anyone ended up getting shingles after getting vaccinated? Share your stories below!"
19941,Vaccine Megathread: If you or anyone who comes into contact with your baby goes into public spaces grocery store church workplace she is going to be exposed to RSV. Its very common but for everyone but the very young and very old it usually just presents as a run of the mill cold so someone you love could bring it home not even realizing that is what they have. We vaccinated our 3 month old and he had zero issues with it if it makes you feel better.
19945,Dementia Risk Drops With Shingles Vaccine: Honestly what with having to get the Covid vaccine annually which had been setting me back for a weekend the Shingles vaccine was just par for the course. Same. But others seem to have a worse reaction. I have heard too many stories about the horrors of Shingles so I think a little suffering is better than shingles which can come back repeatedly and inconveniently.
19953,"An odd observation: Just before the pandemic lockdowns struck, I received a Shingrix vaccination (the first of two). I experienced a very strange reaction for several weeks. My Asperger's symptoms multiplied and became **far** more extreme. I am **NOT** an ""anti-vaxxer"" and I have looked at all the studies that show no statistical link between Autism and vaccinations. However, this was **so** pronounced and so odd, that I kept very careful detailed notes of the experience. And being a scientist, I scheduled a presentation at the National Vaccine Meeting. Then, I thought the better of it. I did not want to fuel any ""anti-vax"" hysteria, so I withdrew my talk. I was going to contact relevant government funding authorities, but I decided I would hold back until after this pandemic nonsense died down. After all, for researchers in the biomedical field, covid19 is probably the biggest event of their careers and/or lifetimes. I did not want to get lost in the shuffle. I did contact the Acquired Savant Syndrome people but the founder is getting a bit old and not as active as he once was. I still think this is a very interesting phenomenon. Have any of you experienced anything remotely like this? I have had lots of vaccinations for all kinds of things, but I have never experienced anything like this before or since."
19958,Shingles. F'in Shingles.: Got them at 39 the first time lol. Then 41 and 42. My doctor gave me the antivirals so I could stock up. Got them again in my mid 40s but after that first time I notice it instantly. Honestly it is nothing with the meds. Without them it is brutal AF. Took a year to heal up my nerve damage in my arm from that first time. Coincidentally enough I have a little patch on my chest this morning I am watching. Do not have that lightning feeling yet though so maybe it is nothing. Another bonus is when coworkers get it I am like GO TO THE FUCKING DOCTOR NOW. DO NOT WAIT. GET THE ANTIVIRALS AND TAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY. Probably saved a coworker's vision once and myself subsequently got it on the side of the head. Have not had it since 46 so I figured I am due.
19959,Shingles vaccine experience: I felt virtually nothing as well. All I felt was like someone punched me in the arm. Tylenol took care of that.
19961,2 years ago in summer it was pretty hot and i spent time with my family in the swimming pool and outside. The day later i got what i thought sunburn for the first time in my life and later on i had a feeling i had a pimple on my sunburnt neck. Since it started to hurt a bit more than anticipated i went to the pharmacy and the lady said i should immediately see a doctor. There i got the diagnosis shingles got Aciclovir and cream to put on the affected area. After a few weeks all good. Last year i got that specific feeling on my neck again and ran to the doctor to start taking medication within the 72h window to avoid the full pain spectrum. The doc told me i should consider a vaccination which is usually for people older than 60. I am in my mid 30s. Again all good. This year the same scenario again. Went to the doc got the meds etc. and asked for the vaccination. It was recommended to do this at least 1 month after the shingles were treated. And now 3 days ago i got Shingrix. In 3 months the 2nd dose. Hopefully this will work out. So far i had a terrible headache in the past days. Has anybody any experience with Shingrix?
19963,I wanted to bang my head How a delayed shingles diagnosis caused much suffering: i had shingles three years ago and it started with an achy tingly feeling on my elbow like i had bruised it. after it became clusters of rashes down one side of my body and numbness i visited my gp and he was like well it is not shingles la and i did not even know what shingles was then lol. went home and after a few days it still did not get better so i looked through the shingles subreddit for photo references and ended up going to polyclinic for a second opinion.... finally confirmed it was shingles and then got the antivirals
19966,"2.5 Months on Rinvoq: Hi everyone, I'm new to Reddit, but I wanted to join and post to share my experience (F, 33) with AS and especially Rinvoq so far. I read pretty much every post in this sub before starting on it, and I think it's only fair to contribute in return and share my own perspective. This is probs gonna be really long, so soz in advance lol. Just for some background: I was diagnosed with AS in 2020 - had been experiencing back pain for years, which I'd been dealing with through physio and exercise though never really keeping on top of despite best efforts. Caught COVID in the initial wave in the UK, which was kind of like catching a ride on a firecracker in terms of speeding up my spinal inflammation to the point of obviously requiring some kind of further investigation and diagnosis. Fast forward to Australia in June 2023, where I've been in a kind of constant low-level flare for 6 months, and when after almost 3 years of NSAIDs doing zilch (ibuprofen and mobic) and having a rheumatologist consistently dismiss my symptoms, things got way worse, really quickly. I began experiencing other, lupus-like symptoms during a time of high stress. This kicked off with a carousel of different, painful hand rashes - crazy dry and thickened skin on my palms and fingers that would then fissure and bleed, swollen finger joints, chilblains, hand/foot oedema during hot weather and showers, butterfly facial flushing. This didn't respond to any topical steroids prescribed by my GP or derm. I also experienced truly debilitating fatigue. I was going to bed at 8pm every night, dropped to part time work, stopped seeing friends because my energy only allowed me to get through work and nothing more. I'm a huge foodie, and the idea of going out for dinner was completely unthinkable. I asked my doctors about whether I could qualify for disability payments because the idea of working enough to earn a living seemed like a ludicrous fantasy - both because of the fatigue, and because of the dense brain fog. Additionally, my hips and spine were so swollen that I could literally see the resultant external puffiness in my thoracic, and it had been a full year since I'd been able to do any exercise at all. Prior to 2023, I was lifting really decent weights, doing yoga, cycling everywhere instead of"
19967,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: Yes I remember it kind of' dying out when I was little. Early 70's. I was never sent to one. but was occasional exposed to kids to had been to one or had small pox. I know I had vaccinations to go to school just not sure which ones. I have never had small pox myself but I am in the middle of my first shingles outbreak right now. For a few weeks I thought it was my psoriasis getting gnarly but the Doc identified it in 5 seconds. My mom has no clue what vaccine I have had so here I am. Edit to add never
19968,Eye and face shingles oy vey: Take him back to the doctor. Do not want to scare you but this can turn real bad and the pain can become permanent. It is serious. I had shingles in the same place but was lucky to get it in time before it damaged my eye. While it did not damage my eye that the doctors can see almost two years later I still cannot wear my glasses due to pain behind my eyeball and also have post herpetic neuralgia which is 247 pain on my facehead... cannot wear a hathelmet or sleep with the left side of my face on a pillow. It sucks and the doctors tell me might have been prevented with more aggressive treatment early on. Best of luck and do not worry about costs...a few yrs from now if this is permanent there is no amount of money that will help him.
19969,My buddy got shingles and Bells palsy at the same time gaurantee becuz vaccine. Hes had a rough go.
19970,Shingles vaccine: Awful My md was like this is definitely genital herpes but it had a weird pattern and felt nervy. I actually made her culture it and when she called me she was like yeah this is the first case I Have ever seen and I Am sorry
19976,Hello  I just was diagnosed with Shingles yesterday. A rash started on my buttocks and I went in right away. The doctor was my OBGYN and she prescribed Valacyclovir Valtrex 3 times a day for 5 days 1000mg or 1 Gm. I am reading all over that usually people take this dose for 7 days. Can anyone share how long they took it? Also  how long were you off work? Given the location of mine sitting in my chair does not seem like a good idea especially because it is blistering. I have nerve painaching from my hip to my foot on the side where the rash is.
19980,Can we talk about the Shingles vaccine?: I had shingles and covid together at Christmas 2021. Shingles are awful. They were all across my chest and covered a nipple. Wearing a bra was impossible but just shirts would rub them too and it hurt so bad. I would get shooting pains through my chest cavity into my back that would take my breath away. Needless to so I cannot get the vaccine either. But we definitely should be able to.
19982,My parents sent me to a Chickenpox party as a kid. Now I have shingles.: I got Shingles and it was awful. The next day after the intense burning stopped I got my daughter the chickenpox vaccine. My mom never sent me to a party but I got them in school possibly kindergarten.I know I was young because I do not remember it at all. Shingles are no joke. I felt like I was burning burned with a hot iron.
19984,PSA Beyfortus: My preemie got it at his second round of shots. Super happy its available
19986,Could reactivation of herpes virus because neuropathy and brainfog? Shingles vaccine?: Yes the covid virus fucked us up definetly
19990,Shingles vaccine destroyed me: If you are able I would call right now and leave a message with their service and explain what happened what you said here and ask them if they can get your info to the oncall rheumatologist. Every patient is different but it is very important to work with ones rheumatologist when it comes to instructions on which vaccinations to get and whether or not to stop the biologic medication until you recover from the side effects of the vaccination. Some doctors depending on the patient and depending on the doctor are very clearcut about not taking biologics at the same time as a vaccination in the day leading up to it or restart it too soon and so overlapping those days. It seems unusual to me to get a vaccination and not wait for a certain time based on what the rheumatologist has recommended. They have always been careful with me to take me off of any Biologics ahead of time when receiving a vaccine and giving enough time for the vaccine to go through its process and resolve completely before restarting the Biologics. But that is just me. It might not be the same for you. This is not medical advice and I am not a doctor but it is possible that you are having a reaction because as far as I know and at least in my medical history it is not a good idea to get a vaccination which will because the auto immune system to react for several days and at the same time continue taking a biologic medication that has immunosuppressant natures. Forty eight hours is not enough time for the shingles vaccine process to complete so starting up on a biologic that soon is also going to affect your autoimmune system. So in theory you have three auto immune responses occurring right now 1. You have an auto immune disease. your auto immune system is wonky already. 2. You got a shingles vaccination. Your already compromised autoimmune system is working to process the vaccination and some people have brutal responses such as the kind you are describing so it makes sense that you are feeling terrible. 3. You took a biologic medication that also affects and has the ability to suppress your autoimmune system after only 48 hours after the vaccination for a few days. That is a triple whammy for the auto immune system to have to handle so in theory it would make sense that you feel that horrible. TLDR Definitely get in touch with your doctors service right now. Considering how badly you feel and considering what you have said its really important for you to get this information to your doctor or the oncall doctor and get feedback as to what to do right now but also to keep this in mind for the future. In the future because you had the severe of a reaction your doctor might want to more strictly manage how and when you start and stop your biologic medication whenever you get a vaccination. With the level of suffering you are undergoing especially given the circumstances I would absolutely contact your doctors and get instructions. If you are still feeling this poorly and you are not able for some reason to get a hold of a doctor you may want to go to the ED. This sucks. I am so sorry that you are going through this right now. Unfortunately with this disease it seems like a neverending learning process but at least you have some data now to work from with your doctors moving forward. I hope that you can reach somebody now or first thing tomorrow. If you do not have help you are unable to get a hold of your doctor or noncall doctor and you still cannot function and are still this miserable I personally would go to the ED. Somebody has to take care of you and if you are this bad of a state then there is not a better place to be than a hospital. Always err on the side of safety.
19993,flu shot?: I got get all of the available shots now that I am on infusions. I did not get the shingles vaccine since no one mentioned it to me but I did get SHINGLES a few months after being on Remicade. I wish I would gotten the vaccine because it was a decently severe case of shingles. I do not know what you need to get the shingles vaccine but you should probably at least get the flue and covid vaccines.
19997,UPDATE I went to see my GYN yesterday  she checked my cervix. She could see my IUD strings just fine they were a little shorter and she also did an ultrasound. My IUD was perfectly in place. She did see 2 spots on my cervix where the LEEP wound was that were oozing blood and seemed like they did not scab. She said this could potentially be why I had these 2 instances of gushing blood as the blood could have pooled there. She put a ton of the Monsel's solution on my cervix so it would stop bleeding and when she did that it HURT so bad I started crying. She asked if it was painful when she touched my cervix and it was. She pressed down on my lower abdomen and that hurt as well. She thinks I have an infection in my uterus and prescribed me 2 antibiotics. I am so upset about this whole situation I started crying in frustration. Has anyone had an infection in uterus post LEEP? I am worried about longterm effects and if I do not get better I need to go back to the hospital. In more positive news the results from pathology came back as negative margins for just CIN II so no cancer and will only have to go back in 6 months and then a year for a pap to make sure all is good. I still have a follow up appt with my GYN on Dec 9th so hopefully all is good by then. Original Post Hi everyone Dealing with a frustrating issue and hoping to find some people that have gone through something similar. Sorry in advance for the long post but just want to be detailed In September I 25F went for my checkup GYN appointment at a new GYN. I believe I had went to my previous one sometime in March of 2023. I know that some GYN's abide by only doing a pap smear every 23 years if you have had a normal one but since I went to a new one she wanted to do a pap smear. I also go yearly because I have an IUD Kyleena that was placed 3 years ago so I like to get my strings checked especially because I am in a serious relationship. I have not gotten a period since May of this year but have had very light periods for the year before that due to IUD. A few weeks after my pap my GYN called me and informed me that my pap came back abnormal and I tested positive for HPV 16. I was quite shocked because I had never had an abnormal pap and my last pap was about 1 or 2 years prior I only had 1 shot of Gardasil so now I will definitely be starting the series again. My GYN wanted to do a colposcopy so I scheduled one for the week after. She took 3 biopsies and scraped my cervix for cells. It was not a great experience thankfully my IUD experience was amazing so it was definitely more uncomfortable than that. I did not bleed really at all after just had weird discharge and cramping but I was fine after a week. My colposcopy results came back about 2 weeks later and 2 of the biopsies came back as CIN II so my GYN wanted to do a LEEP to get rid of the cells. She does the procedure at the hospital in the OR under general anesthesia which I am incredible thankful for because I do not think I could handle being awake for it. She gave me a very basic rundown of what to expect and said that my IUD strings could potentially get cut pretty short during the procedure but that it would be fine. My procedure was Friday November 15th. Everything seemed to go fine according to my GYN and I scheduled my follow up appointment on Dec 9th as my GYN will be away the week before then to make sure all is healing and get the pathology results from LEEP. I was definitely in pain after the procedure and had pretty bad cramps. They prescribed me a strong Advil and advised me to alternate between that and Tylenol. My heating pad was my best friend. I had very mild spotting of the weird solution they put to stop bleeding but that is really it for the next few days. I was extremely tired but felt like I could walk around for a bit just fine. Last week on Thursday Nov 21st. I woke up with no discharge and started my work day I WFH. About an hour later I got up from my desk and immediately started gushing blood and bled through my pants. I ran to the bathroom and the blood was BRIGHT red with a little baby clot coming out. I was in shock and called my doctor who advised me to give it a bit before heading to the ER. I was bleeding after just not as heavy but passed another clot. My dr called me back and suggested I go to the ER at that point. I waited 5 and half hours in total being seen for about 10 mins by the GYN there. She said everything looked fine but she did see some dots of blood on my cervix so she put silver solution on it to stop the bleeding and called my dr to updated her. She suggested I follow up on Monday. She could not see my IUD strings and suggested an ultrasound if I was worried later on. She said it could have been a clot that got dislodge a cauterized piece that got dislodge or there was a chance it was my period. The next day I felt okay and went to dinner with a friend in the city NYC and did a bit of walking. I started bleeding after. The next day I walked a few blocks to get brunch and bled again. I decide to go on bed rest the rest of the day and next and I did not bleed at all from Saturday afternoonMonday morning. Yesterday I wake up and again barely have discharge. I sit at my desk for work and get up  the same thing happens as last Thursday. I start gushing blood  rush to the bathroom. I pass a HUGE clot and the blood is BRIGHT red again. I call the service line for my doctor at 1130 AM and they said they will contact the office. My doctor's office calls me at 500 PM  and says they will contact my doctor. I still have not heard from my doctor. I am extremely exhausted and have weird cramps that are more like stabbing pain here and there as well as in my back. I had a headache yesterday all day and same as last Thursday. I really do not think it is my period as the bleeding seems to stop and start with too much activity. I am not bleeding right now and barely have discharge again. Also I literally have not had a heavy period in over 2 years and no period at all in months. I am getting very frustrated as I feel like something is not right  do not know where to go from here. I am worried it could be my IUD moving out of place or something else. I obviously did not want to get cancer which is why I did the procedure but I wish my GYN warned me of this potentially happening. She made it seem like I should be fine in a week or so and even said I could go to the gym and lift whenever I felt ready. I would love to hear others thoughts or if anyone has gone through something similar after LEEP. Feeling betrayed by my body and frustrated by my doctor at this point. Thank you 3
19998,My pediatricians office finally has the RSV vaccine in for my kids age and weight he is 8 months old. The office however told that we are nearing the end of RSV vaccine. The person I spoke with said the RSV vaccine for infants is a one and done vaccine not every year from what I heard I thought it was. While he does not attend daycare he does see three younger 2 5 year old cousins on a monthly basis that are in daycare. What would you do?
20000,The shingles vaccine and how it could have saved me: I had one case of shingles in my mid thirties a few blisters that started just below my throat and trailed up around to the back of my neck and into my hairline basically following th one nerve that had it. I could not wear a real shirt for days it was beyond painful and that was just ONE STRAND. I cannot imagine if it had spread or gotten into my eyes etc.
