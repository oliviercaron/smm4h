4938,"Shingles or Gypsy Moth Caterpillar contact?: Hey everyone, I'm 42/M residing in York Region, Ontario, Canada. In the past few weeks we have gotten a lot of gypsy moth caterpillars. They're everywhere. About a week ago I felt a tingling on-and-off throughout two or three days (but no visual issues) on the front side of the band area/crease between right thigh and hip. It slowly made its way around the hip to the side and kinda on the back as well (right side again). Then I started noticing pink spots appearing after the two or three days. I chalked it up to somehow getting an unfortunate encounter with a gypsy moth caterpillar. The pink spots, over a day or two, on the front thigh/crease area, began to blister. They're not bubbled, dark red coloured, some have popped (not by me scratching at them tho). There are also relatively new patches/clusters of spots, much smaller compared to the initial/main cluster, that are now on the right hip as well as lower-back, slightly right of spine (i.e. same side of body as the other patches). Does shingles do that? Show up in patches at different times? or is this really just an unfortunate contact with gypsy moth caterpillar? EDIT: I also got first dose AstraZeneca vaccine on April 27th with very minor side effects (mild body aches for an afternoon, the day after getting jabbed)",1,0.0021623385,0
4640,"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Shingles isn't always bad. A couple years ago, my husband had a small rash about the size of a quarter. It didn't hurt, didn't itch, nothing. But it annoyed him that it was there for a couple weeks. He got a telehealth appointment, and the doctor looked at it over Zoom, then had him go right in so the doctor would verify what he thought it was since he wasn't expecting to see shingles in a young person. Well, it was shingles. My husband never had a single pox mark as a kid. He was asymptomatic to the point that he thought he never had chicken pox. There was nothing the doctor could do since there was no pan or anything, but did tell him to stay away from people who hadn't had chickenpox or the vaccine. Oops. Our daughter has a legit medical exemption to most vaccines due to the severity of her reactions to the few she's had (I also react so horribly that I have no intention of ever getting another vaccine-hospitalized twice from vaccine reactions). Poor dear spend her 12th birthday with chickenpox, which sucked. She had measles a few years prior. Though I got Covid thrice (including being one of the 2019 cases), she never got that, but did get the vaccine which made her so, so incredibly sick that fuck anyone who tells me she should get boosters because what about granny.",1,0.060118843,0
5585,"Any normal covid recoveries out there? Need reassurance: 4x vaxxed and a person with bad health anxiety COVID first timer Tested positive Tuesday, symptoms started Monday afternoon. I opted not to take Paxlovid because I usually struggle with side effects from medications and the last time I took an antiviral for shingles I felt so awful for weeks after. It's like the weirdest cold ever. I have waves of feeling fine and then will get hot flashes or cold flashes, lightheaded, bad headache, minor nasal congestion and a super annoying dry cough that is worse at night. Sneezing..and bloating like none other. But overall I have been sicker in the past. I generally do not get sick, I had a cold earlier this year but prior to that I hadn't been sick since 2019. My friends just had covid weeks ago and they were ok after a few days minus a lingering cough that one of them still has. They are my inspiration I'm looking to lol. I'm drinking lots of water and taking zinc/elderberry lozenges. We are camping next Friday for a week with multiple stops along the way. I have sooo been looking forward to this vacation/trip, my last one I had kidney stones on (??) and spent the whole week recovering. But now reading this Reddit, I am feel anxious about all the could be's. Reading that resting is key for weeks after infection....i mean i can rest for a week but not for *weeks*. Reading about potential rebound...and in the meantime the dishes are piling up and the house is a mess. Reading that your immune system will be down for weeks after and you get every sickness on earth... COVID is not good for someone with anxiety I just need some success stories! Maybe I just stay off this Reddit lol",1,0.0049434872,0
3956,"I finally got it!: After being turned down 3 times by my hospital for the COVID vaccine, I finally found someone to give it to me! Backstory- I've had several anaphylactic reactions to flu shots over the years as well as the shingles vaccine last year. When the vaccine first came out, the hospital and my doctor had a wait and see reaction for me. They wanted more data. Fair enough. Asked again this summer,still no one seemed too bothered about me not getting the shot. Then my hospital made it mandatory. Figured I'd finally be able to get it. Surgeons and anesthesiologists I work with suggested getting an IV beforehand (I'm a hard stick) and having someone on standby in case of severe reaction. I asked employee health if we could do this. Big nope for me. Told just to file for an exemption. Really? I'm willingly to go thru all this but they can't be bothered? Finally contacted my old doctor (would still be with him if he hadn't dropped my insurance). He was willing! Set up the necessary precautions and even got the J&J shot so I wouldn't have to go thru this twice. Not ideal I know, but I was just excited to get anything! Anyway, day finally arrives. Everyone's all prepared. I get the shot. And within about 10 minutes muscles start to get rigid and itchy welts start to appear. But no breathing issues thankfully. 300mg of IV Benadryl and 3 hours later I get to go home still itchy and some muscle issues. But I got it! I'm just so relieved and thankful for my doctor being willing to try. Worth the week of hives and itching. Oh, to be a child again when nothing bothered me. If I could just stop finding new allergies as I get older, I'd be ecstatic. EDIT: Thank you for the awards and the support. For those of you sending me nasty PM's, please stop. The doctor who treated me was my PCP for 16 years and very familiar with how to treat me. If it wasn't an insurance issue, I'd still be with him. My current doctor has seen me once and is clueless about my history as is employee health. I've been bullied since the vaccine came out at work and here because I haven't been able to get it. And now I'm getting bullied here for getting the vaccine. And as to why I didn't just take the exemption",1,0.28395626,0

6873,I took Valtrex and I have diarrhea 5 days after I finished it: I was prescribed Valtrex (valacyclovir) for my shingles within 72 hours of getting it. Before I took it I asked my doctor if the medication would give me cdiff. I have had cdiff in the past and had a fecal microbiome transplant in December for it. I have post infectious IBS so I occasionally have diarrhea and lots of gurgling tummy issues when I don't eat right. My doctor told me that valacyclovir is an antiviral and not an antibiotic and that it would definitely not give me cdiff.

1102,"Horrible reaction to CT scan with contrast? I'm livid currently: As the title says, I am having a terrible reaction/flare due to receiving a CT scan with iv contrast. Back story as to why- I have lost about 15lbs unexplained in a matter of months and have had back pain. We obviously want to rule out cancer (we did, according to the scan). I'm extra sad though because I had been feeling GREAT the last 3-4 days, and nearly 90% yesterday. My pacing was working and I loved having a string of good days. Until I go in for this scan and it's 150 steps back. This illness has a fun way of cruel timing doesn't it. Since the scan and contrast injection, I have been experiencing flare symptoms that I have only felt with illnesses such as shingles. Constant aching, burning muscles, weakness, extreme fatigue, inability to sleep, etc. this is not my usual baseline nor is it what PEM feels like. PEM feels more manageable and ""bodily"" whereas this feels more, ""illness"". Did I totally screw myself and my progress by getting this scan? Like why would the contrast dye from the scan cause my ""CFS switch"" to light up like a dang firework?

My anxiety caused more issues than anything. 18 hours - maybe a very mild headache and some mild diahrea but nothing bad, still did yard work and everything is more or less completely good. 24 hours - about 2 hours before, started feeling body ache and chills from a slight fever. Took a Tylenol and it's chilling out. Caught me off gaurd being so much later than expected but still not bad, the Shingrix vaccine that I had to take as a prerequisite for starting is still so far 5x worse and that was just a day of a vaccine hangover of sorts. 36 hours - the above body ache and small fever last maybe 2hr tops and now just a headache but feel this headache is a tension type one and not Med related.
