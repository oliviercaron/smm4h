Xet Storage is enabled for this repo, but the 'hf_xet' package is not installed. Falling back to regular HTTP download. For better performance, install the package with: `pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet]` or `pip install hf_xet`
c:\Users\Olivier\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\transformers\convert_slow_tokenizer.py:559: UserWarning: The sentencepiece tokenizer that you are converting to a fast tokenizer uses the byte fallback option which is not implemented in the fast tokenizers. In practice this means that the fast version of the tokenizer can produce unknown tokens whereas the sentencepiece version would have converted these unknown tokens into a sequence of byte tokens matching the original piece of text.
