6,"Shingles Vaccine: Warning, this post contains an optimistic antidote to post-vax sickness! I survived the shingles vaccine. The first dose felt fairly normal afterward, meaning I felt under the weather for a day but was functional. The second one laid me out pretty good. I slept quite a bit the next day as if fighting something off. I've since found -- and tested - recent instructions from the CDC in the US saying that taking ibuprofen, aspirin or Tylenol after taking a vaccine can relieve sick effects without hindering the efficacy of the vaccine. I always do it with the covid vax now and I'm good to go.",1

43,"Getting two vaccines at once: I have a very reactive immune system. 1 vaccine is usually enough to make me feel pretty gross so I would never do 2 at once. The covid vaccine has put me in the ER twice so my doctor has basically made me a DIY kit to deal with the symptoms so I don't need to go back. Having symptoms of illness after a vaccine doesn't mean you are actually sick. The point of a vaccine is to get your body to mount an immune response in a small, controlled way so your body will be able to recognize and deal with the illness if you are exposed to it. It's your body's immune response, not the actual illness that creates symptoms when you're sick. So, if you have a vaccine, or 2, and your body generates a larger immune response than expected, you might have symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, chills, etc.",1

Experiencing debilitating fatigue, muscle aches, and cognitive fog became my new normal. I attributed these symptoms to my existing autoimmune condition, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which often mimics long-haul COVID symptoms. However, after receiving my fourth booster shot (6th shot in total) in March '23, my health plummeted further. Severe gastrointestinal issues, unexplained rashes, and relentless joint pain plagued my daily life. It was a battle I never anticipated fighting. As months passed, new symptoms emerged - chronic migraines, sudden weight loss, and hair loss that left me feeling defeated. It wasn't until I contracted a breakthrough COVID infection in August '23 that the reality of being a long-term long-hauler truly hit me.

However, what stands out to me is the correlation between my neck pain flares and my heart rate fluctuations, temperature sensitivity, and overall autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

Eager to prevent future recurrences, I expressed my interest in getting vaccinated, only to face insurance coverage hurdles. Determined to safeguard my health, I persisted in finding a pharmacy willing to administer the vaccine, despite encountering skepticism and resistance. Finally, in November 2021, I received the first dose, which surprisingly provided relief from my post-herpetic nerve pain. Despite the financial strain, the peace of mind was invaluable. Today, I received my second shot, reaffirming my commitment to staying shingles-free. Remember, your health is worth advocating for, even if it means overcoming obstacles along the way.",0

The resurgence of Mumps symptoms, including swelling of the salivary glands, fever, and body aches, has caught many off guard and left them hesitant to proceed with additional doses of the MMR vaccine. It seems that the Mumps flare-ups after vaccination may not be a direct consequence of the MMR shots but rather a result of the immune system's response to the vaccine, potentially reactivating the virus in some individuals. Given the common queries on this topic, I wanted to create a platform where individuals can share resources, articles, and videos that shed light on Mumps outbreaks post-MMR vaccinations.

I tried to treat it as acne with facial cleanser and Clearasil for the second and third day after discovering bumps. After seeing no improvement and my wife constantly urging me to get it checked I went to urgent care on day four. The doctor there diagnosed it as shingles from the fact that it was more linear pattern and scabs had started to form that wasn't from my doing.

Because I'm 40, it required approval...and I did eventually get the green light, but the combination of vaccinations left me feeling extremely unwell, coupled with a stressful week at work. I decided to hold off and allow my body to rest, but ended up having a major disagreement with a friend. Last Friday, I started noticing some red spots on my skin. I often experience skin irritations due to allergies, as well as feeling fatigued and run down before my menstrual cycle. On Monday, the spots had spread and started to itch intensely. I attributed it to stress and lack of sleep. By Wednesday, the red spots had turned into a rash all over my body. I visited my doctor who confirmed it was measles and prescribed medication. I'm feeling weak and exhausted with constant itching and discomfort. The rash is more widespread than before but not as severe as some cases I've seen. Now I'm wondering if getting the measles vaccine post-recovery is worth it, despite the potential side effects.

This info shouldn't stop anyone from getting the vaccine, but if you have a reaction like this, a rash, or pain, see a Dr as early as possible.

3217,"Shingles activated after 2nd Pfizer shot? Coincidence?: I got my 2nd shot on 5/28/21. Had ""ice pick"" headaches that started on 5/30/21. No other symptoms. On 6/1/21, the headaches progressively got worse and I went to the ER and was diagnosed as having Occipital Neuralgia. They gave me an occipital nerve block, steroids and anti inflammatory medication. I had no other symptoms present except these headaches. No physical injuries that are usually associated with occipital Neuralgia. On 6/3/21, developed a rash on the entire left side of my scalp. Same area where my headaches occurred. (This is when I assumed the nerve block caused the rash) 6/5/21, rash progressively got worse and started blistering and filled with fluid. Visited the doctor and he believes I may have Shingles. The doctor prescribed me viral medication and hopes it will resolve itself. He was somewhat surprised how it suddenly appeared and thinks it could be the vaccine along with an immunocompromised system that may have activated the virus. He is still doing a bit of research. I do not have any known allergies to medications so the nerve block, steroids and current medications are not causing this rash. This is apparent with my lack of symptoms. No swelling, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, nausea. I feel normal except the fact that I have these ""ice pick"" headaches and head rash. I have another appointment on Monday with my primary care physician to do an extensive examination. Just to clear the air. I do not believe the vaccine gives you shingles. From what I'm seeing, I think my immune system was weakened so much from social distancing, wearing masks and taking the vaccine months later instead of when it was first available that the first sight of infection, it caused shingles to appear. I think I would've been fine if I took the vaccine much earlier. Maybe 2-3 months ago. What do y'all think?",1

Since my last post, I have been experiencing some ups and downs with my treatment plan. After switching to the new biologic medication, I initially saw some improvement in my symptoms. However, recently I have been noticing a resurgence of pain and discomfort. It's been a frustrating setback, especially after feeling hopeful about the new medication.

Decided I did not want to risk getting shingles while having side effects from covid vax, so zoster wears first. I got the second zoster vax and first Moderna vax on the same visit. I have not had respiratory symptoms or congestion, the dangerous ones. So I assume the vaxxes will offer varying protection against alpha, delta and omicron.

What is your experience & have you had the second dose? Backstory: Received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Jan 12. I had the usual sore arm starting on the day of injection but the next day I developed a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The next day I was hit with a wave of nausea so debilitating I couldn't get out of bed for a full 24 hours, although it went away as quickly as it came. Fatigue set in and I spent the next two weeks sleeping 15-20 hrs a day. (I was written out of work for having ""Covid like symptoms"" so nothing else to do but rest up.) After a week of these various symptoms, I made a doctor's appt and he ran a wide range of blood tests (all normal) to test for infection, immune response, etc. He stated that it could be a reactivation of the Epstein-Barr Virus: EBV or Mono(nucleosis). I do have EBV antibodies (or I did in 2011 when last tested). I haven't had mono since I was in high school (confirmed via bloodwork at the time) and a suspected reactivation about a year afterward. A week after receiving the vaccine, I had a rapid and (relatively) large outbreak of either a cold sore or shingles (it is on my chin & neck - has been previously diagnosed as both Varicella & HSVI on different occasions...). I typically have outbreaks of this on my lip line when getting dental work, lots of sun exposure, or am very stressed. This is the third time it has been on my chin/neck - the two other times were when I was hospitalized. I'm curious if anyone else has had these recurrences of viral syndromes that have been previously suppressed as well? If so, did you get the second dose? How were your symptoms afterward?

But this time, I faced a high fever, severe chills, all-encompassing body aches, excruciating pain from the injection site all the way up to my neck, and a relentless migraine. The fatigue was absolutely draining. Despite the tough experience, I would go through it all over again without hesitation. Witnessing a parent suffer from Shingles has made me determined to avoid that fate at all costs. To those contemplating getting vaccinated, make sure you're ready. Stock up on fluids, have OTC fever reducers at hand, clear your schedule for a few days, and make sure you have some soup and sandwich ingredients ready to go. And if you can, snuggle up with a cat for some much-needed comfort. ??",1

As the scheduled date approaches, I'm grappling with the decision of whether to go ahead with the vaccination or to delay it, possibly opting for the Shingrix vaccine first. The idea of introducing more substances into my system, especially after the shingles experience, is causing me significant distress. I'm a 32-year-old individual who had chickenpox as a child, with no known immune deficiencies but a history of severe anxiety and depression. The intense nerve pain from the shingles episode was debilitating, and the recovery process has been challenging. Despite doctors' assertions in Australia that there is no correlation between the shingles and the Pfizer vaccine, I can't shake off my doubts and uncertainties. With a high fear of contracting COVID-19 and heightened anxiety surrounding the second shot, I'm seeking guidance and reassurance from others who may have faced a similar dilemma.

TLDR. Probable reactivation of the varicella/zoster virus without skin rashes causing ZSH (zoster sin herpete) leading to post-herpetic neuralgia.

Tingling intensified in the following day and spread to the back and upper arms. The following days, intense constant dermatomal burning pain appeared on random parts on my body, moving around along the day without relief, more strongly on the left part of my body, and exclusively in the left part of my face.

While I was waiting for the pain to go away, I started having raised bumps on my scalp and on my jaw next to my right ear.

After waiting one day, the pain had not subsided so I made an appointment with urgent care. I was able to get an appointment fairly easily. I noticed my lymph nodes in my neck were tender and inflamed. The raised bump on my face had turned a darker shade of red so I applied some concealer and headed to the urgent care facility. They took my vitals, asked me questions, looked into my ear/nose/throat. They determined that based on my symptoms as well as the exam that I had an ear infection and prescribed me antibiotics. I did not bring up the rashes as they weren't alarming to me yet. I wish I had talked about them because I think I would have gotten a quicker diagnosis. Since I was wearing a mask (and using concealer) for much of the exam that my facial rashes were not in full view. Let my experience",1

4311,"My baby probably has the chickenpox.: A week ago on Friday LO had his one year checkup. He received the MMR and the chickenpox vaccine. He's been a hot mess ever since, which I've attributed to teething. I assume if you pop your first two teeth only ten days apart you're going to have a bad time. He's been cranky, whinny, randomly breaking out in tears, and he's been glassy-eyed at times. And he's been fighting me when I clean his foreskin. This morning when I was changing him I saw the site on his thigh where he received one of his vaccines was red and swollen like a welt! It was really alarming to see! So I took him to his doctor. The nurse and I noticed when I undressed LO that his back had red marks and little white bumps. I check his diaper and I see a few of the same marks on his scrotum. And what I thought was dry irritated skin on his face is turning out to be more red rash. We're guessing he's got a mild case of the chickenpox because they notated at his one year checkup that the chickenpox vaccine was given in the leg that now has the welt. There's a less than one percent chance that this can happen. Which is why I'm struggling to find additional info on what to expect. My google-fu is failing me. So if anyone knows the answers to my questions I'd greatly appreciate it! Is he contagious? If so, for how long? Two days ago he spent some time in the church nursery.

Breaking out in hives all over is not fun, my doctor recommended not taking them either after these experiences. What I do notice though is with my immune system it's harder for me to get sick, so when I do catch something naturally I generally have stronger symptoms compared to others. It could be my imagination but I feel like my body does a good job keeping me healthy as a defense when something external tries to get into my body, but once something gets in it does not do that great of a job in the offense, like as if the thing has more opportunity to multiply before my body is like oh that's a thing we should take care of.

My underarm along my torso started hurting as well, extremely sensitive to the touch. My spine between my shoulder blades feels bruised. I went to the doctor 3 days ago after a week of dealing with that. My doctor believed that it was inflammation due to my swollen lymph nodes from the vaccine. I went home and I then broke out into the telltale cluster rash under my left breast a day after that doctors appointment. The pain worsened, my sternum also started to feel inflamed/bruised. Shooting pains all over. Today, I went back to the doctor and got diagnosed with Shingles. My doctor believes that because I got the Pfizer vaccine, my immune system was weakened while creating antibodies and the shingles virus saw that as an opportunity. I'm glad I finally have an answer and the correct medication because this is hell. I plan on following up to see if I have an autoimmune disorder, as I read this ""side effect"" is more common in those with autoimmune disorders.

I've been experiencing awful intermittent neck pain (though it feels like something is constantly wrong but not always painful). Originally it was a pain I woke up with behind my right ear and caused the entire side of my head/neck to unbearably hurt. I went to the ER for it almost two years ago and they told me it could be Mastoiditis. They ran a CT which came back clear and sent me on my way. Since then, however, it's become more isolated to a specific part of my neck and I've realized that everything from my heart rate to my temperature sensitivity goes off a cliff whenever this pain shows up. It's definitely more sharp/stabbing in nature, and I'm currently waiting on an opinion from Dr. Bolognese in NYC after radiologists here saw nothing wrong when looking at my C-Spine MRIs (I've had two).

I've done a bunch of functional testing and know that my parasympathetic nervous system is almost non-existent, my immune system is operating at 3X its upper limit (GI Maps stool test), and Vitamin C is abundant in my blood but at zero in my cells/tissue.

As a healthy non-immunocompromised 40 year old male, I was interested in if it could be related to the vaccine and have done some research on it on the side. It is disappointing to see some of the media stories that try to depict adverse reactions to the vaccine as a means for anti-vax. It's important to note that there are adverse reactions being reported that have both temporal and feasible biological linkages. It is not abnormal to expect these things to happen and not necessarily a reason to avoid the vaccine, but something to be aware of. Further medical research is obviously needed to confirm and document more thoroughly which will take time. I am posting links and snippets for easy consumption. I personally believe that the vaccine is still worth it for me and would do it again and encourage others to get the vaccine. The reason I wanted to post this is to share early research on possible relationships with shingles to the vaccine and to facilitate more accurate reporting. I was originally told by my doctor that my shingles was not related to the vaccine. However, upon research and talking to my physician father I have found that any adverse health event within 3-4 weeks of a vaccine shot is considered a possible linkage. As a result, I think people should be aware of this so that databases can be updated with more accurate data. This will help the medical community further research possible linkages, better understand them, and as one study notes, potentially take steps as necessary to ""minimize risks to vaccinated individuals.""

4608,"My experience with AZ and some questions [22 M]: Hello! I am a healthy 22 year old male and I got the AstraZeneca vaccine about a month ago(15th of March). I got the shot at 2 PM, and started having symptoms at 1 AM the next day when I woke up shivering. At 3 AM I had 39.5 C fever, which subsided to 38 C fever that I had for the next day. All in all, it felt like a really bad cold. For me at least, it was the worst I've ever felt since getting varicella in 8th grade, but all in all, I've no regrets and I'd do it again. If I waited I probably could've gotten Pfizer and been completely vaccinated sooner, but I just picked the first possible occasion as IMHO some protection is better than no protection. Today I did a rapid anti-spike antibody test, and, for the first time, I had a positive result! The line was still somewhat faint, but the moral of the story is: antibodies take time to form, at least for AZ. I was quite concerned the vaccine didn't work for me as I did use two other rapid tests, one two weeks after vaccination and one three weeks after and they were both negative. Now, I also have two questions for you people out there: 1. Did anybody else get a scar at the vaccination site? I got a quite large scar, maybe half a cm across and raised from the surrounding skin. 2. In my country(Romania) the default time between the first and second does for AZ is 8 weeks. From what I've seen, research seems to show the vaccine works better at 12 weeks. I can theoretically call the vaccination call-center and invent some reason why I can't go at 8 weeks and have them reschedule me at about 12 weeks. Spots for AZ seem to be plenty so I don't think it would be much of an issue, but still, it might turn into a headache after all. What would you do if you were in my situation?",1

If I try to take a hot shower I get the electric shock, stabbing nerve pain, same thing If I go in the sun, so obviously I do neither now.

I'm not even getting a placebo effect with any of these options, the pain cuts through at the same level no matter what I take. Any recomendations that I have to try that doesn't require a prescription? I was tempted by capsaicin but the only study that produced quantifiable pain relief used an 8 percent patch and needed local anesthesia to be applied.

That's what's considered a""airborne"" ""contact"" AND ""droplet"" precaution room. I'm 30 years old, I had shingles at age 5, AND I was vaccinated for it after it cleaned up. 2 things. First, now I have a painful rash from the bottom of my scalp/upper neck and it spread down to the side of my neck (skipping my necklace for some reason, silver chain...)

Initially, I brushed it off as fatigue from long shifts. But then the itching began, followed by the appearance of painful blisters. At first, I mistook it for a cold sore, as I have a history of them. A telehealth appointment confirmed it was shingles, likely triggered by the vaccine. I've been prescribed antivirals and gabapentin, but the pain and discomfort seem to be escalating. The blisters are spreading, and I've noticed changes in my sense of taste and blurry vision in my left eye. Balancing work and four kids while dealing with this is a challenge, and the Workman's Comp process has added to the stress. Has anyone else gone through something similar? I have a follow-up appointment soon, and I'm anxious about returning to work in this condition. The lack of understanding and support from some can be frustrating. #vaccineinjury #shinglesrecovery""",1

5004,"6 Months on Covaxin: Hi everyone! I wanted to share my journey with Covaxin, as it's been quite a rollercoaster experience. I received my first dose of Covaxin earlier this year after waiting anxiously for my turn in the vaccination queue. The initial days post-vaccination were smooth sailing, with no noticeable side effects. However, around the 2-week mark, I started experiencing extreme fatigue and body aches, which lingered for a few days. I brushed it off as a normal reaction to the vaccine and continued with my daily routine. Fast forward to the one-month mark, and I noticed that my energy levels were significantly higher than before. I was able to engage in activities that I had previously struggled with due to chronic fatigue. The joint pain that had been bothering me for months also started to subside gradually. I was ecstatic about the positive changes I was experiencing. However, just when I thought everything was going smoothly, I encountered a setback. After my second dose of Covaxin, I developed a mild fever and chills, which lasted for a couple of days. I was worried about the side effects, but they eventually subsided. The real challenge came when I experienced a flare-up of my underlying condition, which had been under control for a while. The inflammation in my joints increased, and I had to rely on pain relief medications to manage the discomfort. Despite the setbacks, I must say that Covaxin has been a game-changer for me. The overall improvement in my energy levels, reduced joint pain, and the sense of protection against COVID-19 have been worth the temporary challenges. I'm hopeful that with time, the flare-ups will become less frequent, and I can continue to enjoy the benefits of the vaccine. Feel free to ask me any questions about my experience with Covaxin, and remember that everyone's journey with vaccines can be different. Stay safe and take care! ---",1

5310,"The shingles vaccine, and how it could have saved me: The negative pressure room is because shingles (and chicken pox) are airborne viruses.

Question: Has anyone experienced an allergic reaction similar to what I'm going through after receiving the Covid vaccine? What was your experience like and would you recommend proceeding with the second dose? Backstory: I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on March 1. Initially, I only had mild arm soreness, but the next day I started developing hives all over my body and had difficulty breathing. I rushed to the ER where they administered antihistamines and monitored me closely. The doctors suspect it could be a severe allergic reaction triggered by the vaccine. I've never had such a reaction before and I'm now hesitant about getting the second dose. I'm curious to hear if anyone else has faced a similar situation and how they decided to move forward with the vaccination. I want to do my part in the vaccination effort but I'm concerned about the potential risks involved. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. **UPDATE**: Despite the allergic reaction to the first dose, I decided to proceed with the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 22nd. Surprisingly, I experienced no adverse reactions this time and felt relatively normal. It has been a week since the second dose and I have not had any recurrence of hives or breathing difficulties. I'm relieved that the second dose went smoothly and I hope my experience can help others facing a similar dilemma. ---",1

5404,"**Vaccine and HPV - My Personal Story and Findings:** After receiving my first dose of the HPV vaccine, I experienced some unusual symptoms that led me to research the possible connection. As a 30-year-old woman in good health, I was surprised by the reactions my body had post-vaccination. While my doctor initially dismissed the link, my own investigation revealed that there may be a temporal association between the vaccine and certain adverse health events. I believe it's crucial to share this information for accurate reporting and to encourage further research in this area. Despite my experience, I still believe in the importance of vaccines and would recommend them to others. I came across a study by Dr. Samantha White on the reactivation of the Human Papillomavirus after HPV vaccination, which suggests a potential biological association. The study discusses how the immune response triggered by the vaccine could lead to the reactivation of latent HPV infection, although more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. It's essential for medical professionals to be aware of these possible linkages to provide better care for vaccinated individuals.

5406,"Shingles on tongue only 2 months after 2nd vaccine dose? Or something else?: Hi everyone: this post's for my mom (64) who got her second dose of the shingles vaccine about two months ago. I have a couple of questions, but first here's her background: My mom has type 2 diabetes, but it's very much under control. Still, she's immunocompromised to a degree. During the past two days she's mentioned that she felt symptoms similar to a sinus infection (mostly just very mild sinus pressure). Yesterday, she started to get what she thought was a canker sore on the bottom tip of her tongue, which she sometimes gets when she's really stressed (which she has been with work lately) although she checked in a mirror and didn't see anything on her tongue. This morning, the pain under her tongue increased significantly. I checked in to see how she was doing, and it definitely didn't look like a canker sore... it looked more like white patchy blisters on the bottom tip of her tongue. She's insured through Kaiser and scheduled an appointment with a doctor (not her primary) through their Telehealth clinic. The doctor said it may be shingles and prescribed her an antiviral medicine that she started later this morning. She told her to schedule an appointment with her primary if it gets worse. My first question: has anyone here had shingles where it only affected your mouth? She's not experiencing pain anywhere else and doesn't have any rashes on her body. Her experience with Kaiser's been pretty crappy since her employer switched to them two years ago. I know that they're the professionals and I should trust their diagnosis, but I'm skeptical of the care she gets through them based on prior bad experiences with them. My second question: is there anything she can do for the pain on her tongue? Most of the treatments I've seen are topical skin treatments, but the pain she has is in her mouth :( The doctor she spoke to recommended popsicles, which I bought for her and she said they hurt to eat. Sorry for the rambling, but she's in a ton of pain and I feel helpless. I hate the idea of her having to just wait and see if it gets better. I'm also an incredibly anxious person so of course my mind is jumping to worst-case scenarios lol. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated! Thank you ????",1

5411,"Heal Me and I Will Be Forever Grateful: So, I want to preface this by saying my story is borderline-HOUSE, and I am more than aware of that. There are intricacies I've probably skipped over below so please don't hesitate to ask questions as well. I'm a 33M (5'11, 220lbs, White, Non-Drinker/Smoker), and just over a year ago my health (and life) changed forever. About two weeks prior to getting my first Pfizer dose, I went to the doctor for what looked like a minor rash with pain on my ribcage. The doctor thought it could be the start of shingles but advised me to hold off on any medication to see if it would go away on its own. It went away the next day, and after consulting with my doctor, was advised it would be okay to get the vaccine. Within minutes of the first dose, I developed a stabbing sensation in my sternum. I woke up the next day with full blown shingles down my midsection and was put on Valtrex for 10 days. Despite this, I was told to get the second dose as I had been fully treated for the shingles. After the second dose, I had a sensation of too many heartbeats and went through a gauntlet of testing that returned normal. I did, however, become increasingly fatigued and unwell and felt like I wasn't bouncing back as expected. This is where things got hellish/interesting, and is something I'm still trying to understand. I was prescribed Bactrim (Sulfa) for a misdiagnosed infection in early September 2021. Within four days, I had a huge rash on my back, my mouth and extremities were on fire, and I was completely weakened to the point I could barely move. The only thing I could compare it to was when (I believe) I was given HSV-1 by a girlfriend in college. I went to the ER and all labs returned normal. Despite stopping the medication and taking nothing further, I continued to deteriorate, though again, none of this showed up in labs. I was eventually hospitalized in October after Prednisone sent me into a full-blown crash where I could barely drag myself out of bed. The doctors ran their tests, told me it was anxiety a week later, and sent me on my way with no further help. Since then, I've developed ME/CFS, P",1

5643,"Encountering my 4th episode of the Rotavirus: Hello everyone, I'm a 50-year-old individual currently battling my 4th episode of the Rotavirus infection. My first encounter with this virus was back in 2005, and it left me bedridden for days with severe vomiting and diarrhea. The symptoms were so intense that I had to be hospitalized for dehydration. Fast forward to my recent Rotavirus vaccine, and I thought I was in the clear. However, a few weeks later, I started experiencing abdominal cramps, bloating, and frequent trips to the bathroom. The familiar signs of the Rotavirus were back, and I knew I was in for another rough ride. This time around, the symptoms seem more persistent, and I can't seem to shake off the nausea and fatigue. Managing this recurrent infection has been a challenge, especially with other stressors in my life. Dealing with work deadlines, family responsibilities, and now this ongoing health issue has taken a toll on my well-being. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next wave of symptoms to hit me. I'm currently on medication to alleviate the symptoms and boost my immune system, but the fear of another relapse is always at the back of my mind. I wonder if there are others out there facing similar struggles with recurrent Rotavirus infections and how they cope with the physical and emotional burden it brings. If you have any advice, insights, or simply want to share your own experiences with the Rotavirus, I would appreciate any support. Let's navigate this journey together and find solace in knowing we're not alone in this battle against persistent infections. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and let's stay strong in the face of adversity. ---",1

The fatigue was overwhelming. Despite all of this, I would absolutely go through it again. I've witnessed a parent suffer from Shingles and that's not something I want to experience. No thank you. For those thinking about getting vaccinated, make sure you're prepared. Stock up on fluids, have OTC fever reducers on hand, clear your schedule for a few days, and have some soup and sandwich ingredients ready. And if possible, cuddle up with a cat for some comfort. ??",1

6246,"My Journey with Pfizer: Hey Reddit fam! I recently completed my Pfizer vaccine series and thought I'd share my experience with you all. I decided to get vaccinated after much contemplation and research, and I'm so glad I did. The first dose went by without any major side effects, just a sore arm for a day or two. However, after my second dose, things took a different turn. I experienced intense fatigue and body aches that made it hard to get out of bed for a couple of days. I also noticed some redness and swelling at the injection site, which was slightly concerning, but it resolved on its own after a few days. Despite these temporary discomforts, I was relieved to be fully vaccinated and protected against COVID-19. Around the 3-week mark post-vaccination, I started feeling a surge of energy and mental clarity that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like a fog had lifted, and I could finally focus on tasks without feeling drained. The joint pain that had been a constant companion also seemed to lessen, giving me a sense of relief and comfort. As I continued on my vaccine journey, I encountered a minor setback when I developed a mild rash on my arms and legs. I consulted my healthcare provider, who reassured me that it was a common reaction and would resolve on its own. True to their words, the rash disappeared within a week, leaving me worry-free. Overall, my experience with Pfizer has been positive, despite the occasional bumps along the way. I feel grateful for the protection it has provided me and the newfound energy and well-being I have gained. If you're considering getting vaccinated, I highly recommend discussing it with your healthcare provider and taking that step towards a safer future. Feel free to ask me any questions about my Pfizer vaccine journey, and remember that we're all in this together. Stay safe and stay protected! ---",1

Some are encountering severe headaches for the first time, others are facing a resurgence of previously dormant migraines, while some are grappling with debilitating fatigue. This unforeseen outcome of the covid vaccine is causing distress, uncertainty, and reluctance to proceed with the 2nd or 3rd (booster) shot. I find myself in a dilemma as well. I had initially planned to get the booster, but I've been battling chronic fatigue for 6 months post my first covid shot. Consequently, I am apprehensive about proceeding and seeking more information to make an informed decision. It's a tough spot to be in - not wanting to risk getting covid, yet not wanting to endure the persistent fatigue or worsening migraines. From what I've gathered, it appears that the onset of migraines/fatigue is not a direct side effect of the covid vaccines but rather a result of the immune system being preoccupied with producing antibodies, thereby potentially triggering migraines or exacerbating existing fatigue due to immune system strain.

Despite never having had shingles before and uncertain history of chicken pox, the numbness persisted and spread from my chest to my hip bone. The sensation loss extended to my face and tongue, leaving me concerned about the unusual symptoms. I have been researching extensively about shingles, but the nerve issues spreading have left me puzzled. As I await my follow-up appointment, I can't help but wonder if others have experienced similar nerve pain progression after a confirmed shingles diagnosis.",1
6612,"Is it possible I had shingles after the Pfizer vaccine and now I'm having strange effects?: On April 13th I got my first dose. Had bad left arm and shoulder blade pain that wouldn't go away. Also had night sweats, elevated heart beat, and worse anxiety than usual. I went to the doctor and was feeling a little bit better and he said some people just get more pain than others and I should get the second shot. Days after the visit, my pain came back and I got leg soreness. My mom mentioned a friend's husband got shingles after the shot but he had a rash. I asked her to check my skin and she didn't see any rash. I had a few small pimples by the injection site, but I am pretty sure those were there before the shot and i have body acne anyway. I don't see any currently. Anyway, I toughed it out and got the second shot on May 4th. Had the usual symptoms and felt pretty good 2 days later. I went to take in the garbage can with my right arm and shrugged my shoulder really high to get over some steps. I felt pain in my trap, clavicle, shoulder, and shoulder blade. 2 weeks go by and the pain is still there and I notice bad weakness in my arm. I have no strength coming from my back, its like my arm is gliding around, and no shoulder stability. Went to the orthopedic doctor. He took an x-ray, moved it around, and wasn't concerned. Literally the next day, i lean on my left arm in my chair and get the same exact symptoms. I went back to my doctor and asked him a million questions but i forgot to mention the possible shingles. He is supposed to call me about my blood work. I've been freaking out ever since. I looked up some video about ""suprascapular nerve entrapment"" which is some rare disorder and the guy doing an evaluation mentioned shingles as a cause. I just never had a rash so I have no idea whats going on. Not to mention I landed on my knee wrong the other day and now its wobbly.

It stays dormant for their whole lives, even. Many people catch chicken pox, which is a herpes infection of a sort. So while it is a stigma to talk about outbreaks, keep in mind this is very common esp for it to be dormant. I got the first shot of the vaccine and the next day a sore appeared on my mouth. I never get outbreaks normally. I've had them from taking arginine, so I avoid arginine. But I certainly don't get them out of the blue. The only thing different is that I've been vaccinated. I did a search for a link and found some new sources and studies linking the vaccine and an outbreak of herpes zoster, which is shingles. So would it be far fetched to find a link to the herpes simplex 1 (oral herpes, NOT the STD genital type). I would like to hear if anyone else has had this happen to them. It is a small outbreak, just one small bump right now. Thank you, and please don't judge. *Edit note: To be clear, yes I know covid vaccines can't GIVE a person herpes.

I'm wondering if it's possible that the Covid vaccination has somehow compromised her immune system in such a way as to leave her open to another virus (shingles/herpes zoster) that was being suppressed until then? I'm sure if this was a frequent event, there would be many reports by now. There are none, so it must be a rare event. Or is it being under reported? My wife is now unsure whether or not she should accept the second vaccine dose when offered in few weeks.

She is now dealing with the painful rash and nerve pain, despite being a healthy seventy-year-old. It's a puzzling situation, as there are very few reported cases of the vaccine causing shingles reactivation. The couple is left wondering if the Covid vaccination somehow weakened her immune system, allowing the shingles virus to resurface unexpectedly.

My side effects started that evening and they were awful. I had every side effect listed and plenty more that weren't listed. I was still experiencing brain fog, light headedness, occasional balance issues, weird vision sensations and more a week after the shot. I was so discombobulated. After a really long walk, the side effects kicked in big time and I was told by a nurse to go the the emergency room to make sure I was ok. The emergency room ran a bunch of tests, including an EKG, which was excellent. They couldn't find anything ""life threatening"" (they literally said that) and told me they would say I had an allergic reaction to the shot. They actually asked me if it was ok to say that. Huh? I was so loopy and discombobulated that I said ok and didn't get that it was so weird they asked if it was ok to do that. Anyhow, I was sent home and told to take it easy and rest. It's now 22 days later apres shot and I still have brain fog, light headedness, weird vision sensations (like focus problems) and more. I keep making simple mistakes (not like me) and have occasional weird memory issues, like brain farts, again, not like me. I can't remember things that I normally would remember. People don't often notice that I'm off, as most of it is internal to me, but I definitely know that something is still wrong. I'm going to call my doctor on Monday to get looked at again. I'll update as time goes on, but if anyone has had a similar experience and can update as to how long the side effects lasted (hopefully they finally end!) I'd really like to know. Thanks!

My doctor recommended the shingrix vaccine due to my health conditions, and I decided to proceed with it to protect myself from shingles. However, after getting the vaccine, I experienced severe nerve pain, numbness in my arm and hand, stomach issues, muscle pain, joint pain, and extreme fatigue.

The ER doctor couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of my reactions, but they treated me with ketamine injections to manage the CRPS flare.

Most recently ankylosing spondylitis has been horrible with pain & all the neuropathies (CIDP, small fiber peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, tinnitus, cognitive/short-term memory/executive function/etc have been terrible. My Rheumatologist now wants to put me on Rinvoq. They also want me to get several vaccines before I start Rinvoq. Being that I had terrible side effects from the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I am concerned with the vaccines; especially the shingles vaccine. I have read about the risk of Guillain-Barre from the shingles vaccination, and I am concerned that I may have a bad reaction to the vaccine. I think it's clear my immune system is dysfunctional, and wondered if anyone was similar to me, and had any bad side effects from the shingles vaccine (shingrix)? The last think I want to do is make my neuropathies worse from a vaccine, before I even start Rinvoq. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

My questions are: A) What is this blister-like thing on my inner arm? Is it chickenpox? B) Am I now susceptible to shingles?

Sudden stabbing itching feelings are part of my menopause journey, as well as just random itching and feeling sick for the 2-4 weeks before my period. I felt sicker on Wednesday but had ridden my bike a lot, so didn't think anything of it. Thursday morning I felt even worse. The bumps had spread in a chain around my left waist. I got an appointment with my physician who diagnosed shingles and got me on antivirals. I'm feeling very weak and run down with itching/tingling/crawling feelings all over my left side. The rash is bigger than last year but very minimal compared to what I see online. Now I wish i had gotten the shingles vaccine! But apparently it's also very hard on the body. Is it worth getting it once I'm recovered, even if it makes me sick? I'm missing all the Halloween parties this weekend and possibly even work next week. I tried to get up and go to the pharmacy today, but was too sick.",1

Im seeing another doctor tomorrow. A few days after 2nd Pfizer dose, another friend developed an infection on her face and on her gums that required surgery - MRSA. I reported my issue to state health office. She did as well. There has been 0 follow-up. There have to be more people in these situations.

The itching, tingling, and crawling sensations on my left side are unbearable, and I'm missing out on Halloween parties and possibly work next week. I initially hesitated to get the shingles vaccine due to concerns about its potential impact on my body, especially after the adverse reactions I experienced from the double vaccinations. However, now that I'm facing the reality of a second shingles episode, I'm seriously considering getting the vaccine once I've recovered, even if it means dealing with temporary sickness. It's a tough decision to make, especially considering the physical toll it may take on me, but the thought of going through another shingles outbreak is equally daunting.

I had to attend a music festival over the weekend for a work assignment and the loud music triggered a wave of nausea and dizziness. The combination of vaccine side effects and sensory overload was not a fun experience. Despite the discomfort, I'm grateful for the protection these vaccines offer against various illnesses. Hoping the immunity will guard me against different variants out there. For those planning to get vaccinated, make sure to clear your schedule and rest up before the shot.

On 8/15/21, I noticed a rash appearing on my abdomen and back, which quickly turned into blisters filled with fluid. Visited the doctor, and they confirmed it was Shingles. I was prescribed antiviral medication and advised to rest. I have no allergies to medications, so it seems like the vaccine didn't directly cause this reaction.

If so, did it require medical treatment? How long was it present and how long did it last before going away? Were there any health complications? Specifics follow below, with a lot of context in the hope people will take me seriously, and photos are attached.** That said, I received a Moderna COVID-19 shot along with a flu shot six weeks ago tomorrow (October 21), and I have not been fully well since. Twelve hours after the shots, I got my typical post-COVID vaccination reaction: my body began to ache and feel stiff, and within a couple of hours, I had severe chills that lasted for about a day and then went away. The body aches lasted about 18 hours overall and faded. This is the same reaction I have had to all Moderna COVID shots. I had one Pfizer shot and the reaction was far less severe. About 18 hours after the shots, though, my chest became very congested and I got a sore throat. Over the next couple of days, the symptoms increased in intensity to the point of being like mild-to-moderate type of flu symptoms. This persisted for two and a half weeks. I don't usually get influenza vaccinations and I assumed this was a side effect of the flu shot. After about two weeks, the sore throat and sinus issues began to wane and after two and a half weeks, they were gone--but I was left with a cough that became worse as the days went on. At about the three-week post-vaccine point, I did a telemed visit and the doctor diagnosed me with ""non-bacterial bronchitis"" and he put me on prednisone for six days. He said the cough would be gone within 48 hours. The cough didn't improve at all. I have an immunological disorder called mast cell activation syndrome for which I get monthly",1

I can cover about 60% of the roof with solar panels (due to set back requirements in florida I can't cover the whole thing). Do you think that this type of coverage will reduce the temperature in the room? What have been your experience with similar coverage - did you see AC use reduce or comfort increase? By the way - I will be insulating the roof next time I re-roof (which won't be for a long time). Insulating from the inside is going to be very expensive and disruptve.,0

Moving from Humira to Rinvoq (assuming insurance approves it). Anticipating in the next couple weeks. Maybe sooner. Hopefully not longer. I've been on humira about 7 years. Was on remicade about 5 years prior to Humira. Both have taken me a long way. Also these headaches with Rinvoq. Are they terrible? I see mention of acne, is it facial? If you have experienced Rinvoq induced acne how long did it last? Have you had trouble with acne in the past prior to Rinvoq?",0

At the peak of one of my burnouts, I started getting (and ignoring) a bunch of physical symptoms - headaches, digestive issues, sleep struggles, etc) until it all exploded into a bout of shingles on my face and back. In another period of burnout, my entire torso broke out in a big itchy Christmas tree rash. I'm not sure if these episodes were caused by general burnout (of the Nagoski variety) or autistic burnout (I am not diagnosed) - or if there is a difference in the two (if you are autistic)? Does anyone relate or know more? TIA ??",0
2655,"RA folks, how was your Paxlovid experience?: I'm 34 with RA and asthma, vaccinated, made the mistake of googling Paxlovid side effects and asking friends about their experiences. I often have weird reactions to medications, and I'm worried Paxlovid will do more harm than good. Never had covid, some symptoms started yesterday, woke up today feeling like a pile of garbage. Sore throat, fever/chills, sinus mucus stuff, some chest tightness, nerve pain similar to what I had with the vaccine and with shingles. Asthma is aggravated for sure, but does not seem *dangerous.* Would love to hear your experience with Paxlovid if you have RA! :)",0

The prep wasn't bad at all, possibly because I shifted my eating habits for two days before I even started the liquid diet day. The prep was no worse than having a stomach bug. The procedure itself was under anesthesia, so it was like falling asleep in a few seconds and then waking up with everything done.

583,"Advancing: With current antivirals, there are some (many?) patients that take these as a suppressive and never have another outbreak again. Others get a significant reduction in outbreaks, others get no benefit. This vaccine could be the same; it may completely reduce outbreaks in some, but not as much in others. For an average across the population, seems they are seeking 70\~80% efficacy (which is what the CDC states the efficacy of current antivirals is). The vaccine works by a different mechanism of action than antivirals; it may have a combined effect that is much more significant than either treatment alone.",0

Obviously being vaccinated against it means it's is extremely unlikely, especially for kids, to get it. Chicken Pox and Shingles are caused by the same virus - herpes zoster. CPox is the initial infection, once that is done the virus lies dormant inside your body and given the right circumstances will 'wake up' and attack a specific nerve branch - this is the shingles outbreak and the second way the virus presents as an infection.

I just had shingles but I am in my 50s so I had chicken pox as a kid. I thought the generation that had the vaccine were not supposed to able to get shingles? Sorry if this has been discussed already.,0

Normally, our immune systems would get a boost when children catch chickenpox, which would delay shingles being activated...but because most kids are vaccinated, we don't get that boost anymore. The result? Shingles in our 30s or 40s instead of 60s. Yay us. I hope I'm able to get the vaccine later this year. This shit is awful.",0

I have yet to see a case, although I am sure since I am in public health I will see one if it pops up in my area Measles, rubella, etc are pretty unlikely in this case though.

We went to the clinic and and were both diagnosed with shingles. What are the odds that we both came down with shingles at exactly the same time given that it is not an infectious disease?

This looks like pityriasis rosea, which is thought to be caused by human herpes virus 6, a different virus than varicella-zoster human herpes virus that causes Chickenpox & Shingles. That large lesion with central clearing is called a herald lesion. It could be mistaken for ringworm, if you didn't have the other skin lesions. Pityriasis rosea is a self-limited outbreak, no treatment available and no treatment necessary. Recurrence is rare. Unless you are pregnant, complications are very rare. The antiviral medications that are used to treat Shingles might shorten the duration of the rash. Antifungal cream won't do anything for this rash.",0

Did symptoms improve after vaccination?: So, a certain type of headache is thought to be caused by vascular irritation from previously having had the chickenpox, or perhaps shingles. The virus never turely goes away if you caught the disease. It is thought that: Either the virus damages vascular systems, or your own immune system over reacts, in the wrong way, trying to stop the virus. I plan to get a vaccine and see if headaches reduce. A vaccine forces the body to make antibodies against the virus, whereas a virus in the bloodstream can cause excessive antibodies against not only the virus, but the rest of the body.

Do you have any other information about this? I mean any thing that works for VHS is exciting and motivating. [article ](<url>)",0
5363,"Shingles. Mild Case on Arm. Any Recommendations?: Hi all, I've got 2 small clusters of blisters on my arm. One on forearm and a small cluster near the joint of my elbow. My traditional doctor diagnosed it as shingles (herpes zoster) and prescribed me an antiviral. My concern is my weak stomach. With antibiotics, I get the vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. I've never taken an antiviral but I may react the same as the antibiotics. Are there any vitamins or supplements that are out there that can help? I've read that quercetin and vitamin D can help (500mg of Quercetin and 3000 UIs of Vit D, 3 times daily), but not many people have commented on it. Any help would be appreciated!",0

The dermatologist which we have been seeing till now for this doesn't listen to her concerns completely and the treatment isn't working too. She is breaking out badly from the treatment and the derm doesn't give a damn. Like why is it becoming so hard to find derm who actually listens to their patients and prescribe effective treatments. Anyway, i would really really appreciate if you guys can throw in some recommendations. It kinda hurts seeing my mom becoming more worried and self conscious of her face after herpes.

I tried asking my doctor about this a few months ago and he just blew it off and didn't respond. What made me think of it is I've just had the shingles vaccine on top of four covid shots. (I have the vaccine list from my former health care provider showing everything I've had, but digging it out is a chore).",0

Some days I'll feel okay and able to function around the house, but then all of a sudden crash and need to just lay down/move really slowly. I also have days (like today) where I'm in bed almost all day long. The worst was getting some fevers and chills but this has progressively lessened, thankfully. Is this normal?

You don't have to become a vampire and fear the sun, just apply sunscreen if you're going to be outside at the beach all day or working outside.

As a result, it will take me MONTHS before I complete my requirements; Hep B is a 3-shot series, and I have to re-titer 60 days after the last shot. While having to deal with these health requirements is bad enough, I've called over 10 doctor offices, only to get a response of ""Sorry, we do not carry those vaccinations."" The list of doctor offices on my insurance company's website came up after I searched up ""Hep B vaccination"" or ""MMR vaccination."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but technically aren't these doctors supposed to carry these vaccinations? Thank you for allowing me to vent, as I'm frustrated by my situation. TL;DR - Nursing school requires immunity to certain diseases. OP needs to get re-vaccinated for MMR & Hep B. Over 10 doctor offices don't carry vaccinations. Edit: Well, finally found a doctor who carried both MMR and Hep B vaccinations. And only had to pay $20 copay. Can't be anymore satisfied.

After 9 months, went up to 50mg bc it wasn't making me sleepy anymore at night. Overall, for me: 50mg is great for sleep, helps with anxiety, and seems to help with the severity of the migraines. Not a great solution for migraines (for me) but it serves other purposes so I'm happy with it. I have also done two rounds of Botox thus far with no decrease in frequency, and slightly less severity.

967,"Shingles Vaccine?: > a doc can give you a shingles or really any vaccine outside of the age ranges if they want to and feel it is warranted. But there is very little need to. Plus, it has not been studied in people under 50 (besides people 18-50 with certain medical conditions that compromise the immune system) so a doctor would need some justification for using it ""off label"". Source for that? I haven't seen the number this low and it seems like it's not stratified by risk factors. Furthermore, it's not our decision to weight the risks and benefits. Some people adamantly don't want to get shingles and are willing to tolerate adverse events following immunization. > One potential problem I can think of with getting it early is the protection may wear off by the time you reach 60-70 when the risk of it (and complications from shingles) is much higher. Not everyone and for many, getting another dose many years later is true for many vaccines and not really classified as a ""problem"". > Have you ever had the chickenpox as a child? Are you vaccinated against chickenpox? Although the risk is very low, shingles is still possible among those who've had chickenpox before or were vaccinated. You even admitted in the earlier statement that some need another dose of vaccine... that proves that vaccination reduces but doesn't eliminate risk.

1035,"What are these weird sore lumps on my back?: Hello good people, I wonder if you can help me out. I'm a bit concerned about these red lumps that have come up over the weekend on my back, they're clustered mostly down my right shoulder and extend halfway across my back and down to my armpit. Pic here: <url> They sting quite a bit and are tender to touch, plus they itch as well. I thought it was an allergic reaction to something, but I haven't changed any bathroom products or washing powders and a quick look over MyFitnessPal shows that there's been no changes in my diet for over a month. I've taken antihistamines but it hasn't helped. I'm a 23 year old Caucasian female, 188 pounds, 6'1 inches tall, currently on 10mg Citalopram and have been for six weeks. My SO is urging me to go to the doctor because he thinks it might be a mild case of shingles (had it as a child) or at the very least some insect bites that have gotten infected. The thing is, we live in Scotland and bitey insects aren't local around here, and our house is extremely clean and had an inspection done recently to check for any infestation issues. We keep reptiles, and do not handle them. Any advice? Should I head along to the doctor's tomorrow? Thanks!",0
3297,"Shingles in China: Hi Guys, I recently was diagnosed with Shingles and 6 small blisters developed on my fingers and another small 7-8 blisters developed on my forearm. For some reason, it wasn't very painful and I initially thought I pulled a muscle (numb, sore, tingly symptoms) and then thought the blisters were an allergic reaction to mosquito bites (I get really bad reactions to bug bites). I didn't realize it was shingles until about 10 days in but fortunately as mentioned before it didn't hurt or itch like what most people describe and I went to see a doctor. I work in China and the doctor only prescribed me 200mg Acyclovir 4x a day. I checked online and most recommended dosages I see with Acyclovir for Shingles is 800mg 5x a day. I have access to buy Acyclovir directly from the pharmacy. Should I go buy more and take 800mg 5x a day instead of 200mg 4x/day? And should I be taking it until all the scabs are completely healed or how long? I will try to make a telemedicine call back to the US, but there is a lot of red tape. I would love to hear everyone's experience and thoughts. I understand you guys are not doctors but I would like some input. Thanks for the support",0

When I turned 18, as apart of my required vaccines to attend university. I was required to get the chicken pox vaccine. 23 years later, bam, shingles. Holy Crap! I would not wish this virus on my worst enemy. I have spent a good hour reading this groups various posts. Anyone who is dealing or has dealt with this virus. You have my complete sympathies! I have trepidation about taking the prescription Gabapentin. The side effects scare me. So far the Acyclovir seems to be working it's magic.

I found the skin around my left eye (same side as the rash) was burning as I put on moisturiser this morning -- this can be something normal when e.g. my skin sensitivities are playing up, but I just want to ease my anxiety that it won't be spreading any further this far into the initial onset of symptoms/in the healing stage? Thanks heaps in advance ?? ETA: Oh, another question! So, the shingles vaccine here (Zostavax) is something like $250 (NZD) when you're not 65. Is it worth getting at my age, *after* a shingles outbreak? To be honest, shingles has kinda been the thing I've always been really anxious about getting, especially as chickenpox as a kid was so awful (got it *everywhere*), so as frustratingly expensive as it is, it's something I'm willing to save for if it means I've got immunity for \~5-10 years (but not so worth it for immunity <5 years).

The only difference is that the proteins are obviously belonging to different viruses.

Blisters sometimes form after itching, but mostly she just gets itchy bumps which scab over as a result of the itching. The bumps are primarily on her arms, hands, legs and feet. Stress does appear to bring on flare-ups or make them worse, but mostly it's the unavoidable itching that causes more bumps to appear.

7600,"Causal evidence that herpes zoster vaccination prevents a 2 proportion of dementia cases: Paper: [<url>](<url>) TLDR and some discussion: [<url>](<url>) Keep in mind: * Shingles (Herpes Zoster) is caused by VZV, which is a virus from the same family as HSV. (VZV causes chickenpox and shingles is essentially the condition of having VZV recurrence events, not unlike HSV's ""outbreaks""). * Due to data availability, this study focuses on Zostavax, the ""older"", live attenuated virus shingles vaccine. The newer vaccine, made by GSK, is more effective (at least in shingles prevention) and could display different results - presumably better results, but we cannot know for sure until this is studied. This is good news because: * It lends more credence to the thesis that latent infections with herpes viruses have a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and thus can bring more attention and urgency to the field. * It can serve as a tailwind to the adoption GSK's already successful shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which would likely put more resources behind the HSV vaccine they're currently developing (and is based on the same technology).",0

I am not suggesting or prescribing, just sharing new info on a supplement I will begin taking. I currently take Lysine for the same purpose and Monolaurin, which disrupts the outer shell of enveloped viruses which allows for our bodies to fight/suppress. "" Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).

It's been 11 weeks since my first symptom (headache), and although I'm feeling much better, I still have some nerve pain, numbness, and itchiness. I'm also pretty sure I've lost some vision, though I won't know how much until I get an eye exam for a new prescription. I already have corrected vision, so this really only means that I will need a slight increase in the power of that lens. Thankfully, I wasn't 20/20 before, if that makes sense.",0
1032,"Shingles and Covid: Hi, 37M here. I began experiencing symptoms of what I recall to be shingles. I had it a year ago and this is very similar, except last time it was in my left groin area and this time it's in my right shoulder/arm. It is accompanied by a slightly sore throat and watery eyes. I saw my doctor today and he ordered me to get a covid test. I don't believe I have covid but then again, who knows. The sore throat has gone away and the pain has subsided a bit but I am now in isolation until I get a negative test result back. My doctor's reasoning behind the covid test is that covid could have reawakened the zoster herpes virus. Although I am pretty sure I don't have covid I am scared that if I have shingles AND covid that I could be at a higher risk of hospitalization from covid. Has anyone experienced this, i.e. shingles and covid at the same time? Has anyone had shingles and covid before?",0

Then Shoppers sent me a text reminding me that I needed to get the second dose and inviting me to make an appointment. I clicked the link and booked my shot. When my partner and I arrived for our appointments, the pharmacist told me that they were too busy to give vaccinations. There were two customers at the pharmacy desk and three employees working behind it. Seriously?! I pointed out that we had made appointments on Shoppers' booking page. Oh yes, he proceeded to tell me, the company had the booking page and his store couldn't opt out of it. Couldn't cancel or change appointments... he went on in such mournful detail about how the corporate system didn't work with them that he could have frickin' given us our shots in the time he spent justifying his refusal to vaccinate us. No reference to not having any vaccine, just ""no time"". Because, you know, there were two other customers there. What the heck?!",0

I originally got one on 01/10 of this year, but I didn't realize you're supposed to get live vaccines on the same day, so I got my second dose of Varicella two days before the YF. After looking over my files, my PC nurse noticed this and said I need to get YF again. But today when I went to a different provider to get it, that doctor said two days doesn't make a difference and that she absolutely wouldn't give me the shot again. She also said since I'm young and have no health problems, there's no reason why the first vaccine wouldn't take. She finally said if I definitely had to get it again, I should at least wait until right before my departure date, which is 06/04. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions about what to do in this situation? Since the MAP is down, I can't message my nurse about it until it comes back up on the 03/28. I guess I could always call the clinic where I got the first YF vaccine and see if they would be willing to give it to me again, but I'm hesitant to do that until I speak with PC about it.

Edit: I should have mentioned that most of these DKAs have occurred with normal sugars. Today is very different from the last few times.

It is a very calculated move - I have been diagnosed in 2011 (symptoms since 2001). Since then I have been on Mesalamine or Sulfazalamine. During the last 5-4 years I had about 1-2 flares per year. Treated most of them with prednisone. My GI told me that it is too much prednisone/ flares and we have to find a better long term solution; suggested Entyvio. And finally I am willing to do so and WILL start. ""But"" - my last flare ended in February and I am feeling great. I know that is probably the best time to start, so Entyvio can prevent future flares.

I was told recently that my health screening/blood work (for a new job I got accepted to) does not indicate that I have immunity to varicella. (Vaccination for this is required for this job. I'm a nurse.) HOWEVER, I'm confused because my immunization record shows that I got the VAR in 1998 (I was born in 1997) and then got another VAR vaccine in 2009. From what I read online, I was supposed to get the second dose from age 4-6 but I got it when I was like 11 or 12. Does this explain why there is no evidence of immunity in my blood work? I also got two MMR vaccines. Now I don't know if I should go ahead and get the vaccines again even though I got them in 1998 and 2009 because there's no evidence of immunity. Any suggestions? I'll also be calling my doctor when they open up but was looking for answers now in the meantime. Thanks!",0

Apparently the stress of planning my wedding (8/10/19) in my backyard was the trigger that caused my outbreak, at least according to my doctor. LUCKILY, the wedding was over and they didn't appear until after the fact. My shingles are on my nose, from the bridge to just above my nostril on the left side. They are currently blistering. I am prone to scarring, because I spent 2.5 years on high dose prednisone for an autoimmune disease (my current biologic medication for the autoimmune makes it so I can't get the shingles vaccine). I have been keeping the blisters clean with witch hazel, and avoiding any chemical cleaners or lotions/creams. How can I minimize the amount of scarring once they start to heal? Should I start treatment as soon as the scabs fall off?",0
5824,"Recent Shingles Diagnosis: My story so far...: That is almost my story. Same placement too. Only difference is I woke yesterday with bad burning deep back pain. I got on a heating pad for about 15 min. After that I felt the area through my T-shirt and felt a walnut size swollen lump. About 15 min later a part oozed. I thought it was a spider bite so went to urgent care. They put me on Valtrex. I woke today and that area is no different. Same on off back pain. No more rashes and the one spot seems to be closing up. Still same red ""lump"", no clusters. It's not at at what I've been reading here so not sure if it's shingles at all. That area doesn't hurt at all. Just the deep back pain. Last week I've felt run down with no energy. Horrible upset stomach. Maybe it's all related? Idk...",0

128,"Generation Xers getting shingles in their 40s: We are getting shingles because we all had wild chicken pox as kids. Now the virus sits inside our nerves, dormant. It stays dormant while there is still chicken pox in the world. We mostly have lifelong immunity to chickenpox now (some rare exceptions, especially in children who had chicken pox as very young infants). Every exposure to chicken pox (in our own children, or friends' kids etc), gives us another 20 year ""booster"" of immunity against shingles, a far worse disease that is hiding latently inside us. There are various research articles finding that adult exposure to chicken pox confers immunity against shingles. Here is an example: [<url>](<url>) Generation X had chicken pox as children, but we were the first generation to vaccinate our children against chicken pox. Lack of exposure to chicken pox leads to shingles. Chances are, more and more of us are going to get shingles in our 40s rather than in our 70s and 80s. The shingles vaccine isn't even approved for people under 60. But they will have to roll it out sooner as this unintended consequence rears its head. How does this experience mesh with yours? The same or do you have a totally different experience?",0

How bad is it in terms of immunosuppression? She said that if I develop a more severe cold or flu with fever or infection I should stop using the drug and restart it later. But surely it takes time for the immune system to bounce back? (As it takes 3 months to build up, surely it takes time for immune system to get back to 'normal' as well?) Which vaccinations do you recommend to have? I had chickenpox as a child and also shingles a couple of years ago (it was very mild). I'm planning to get pneumonia vaccine. I had my last covid booster last December. Is there any info in terms of side effect odds and likelihoods? (For pancreatitis, bone marrow, skin cancer, lymphoma, hair loss etc).",0

Luckily, everything healed up quickly and I didn't have lasting nerve pain. Now, 2 months later I have it again on my back and neck. They aren't as painful this time, but it's a much larger area and more sores. Also, I didn't really notice when it started because they didn't itch but a few days ago I had a terrible headache. I rarely get headaches but this one was so bad I had to stay in a dark room with no sounds like when people get migraines. Is it common to get a bad headache with shingles?

I've had a mild cough, some dizziness/heaviness feeling, sweet tastes in my mouth, random smells no one seems to seem, random splotches on skin, red splotchy skin on faceand cognitive abilities being effected and even a throbbing pulsing above my right ear/side of head. I even tore a hamstring muscle this year, as I think these virus' had weakened me and kept me inactive. I have a hunch I had covid initially since Ive read it's been linked to triggering dormant virus in bodies, such as EBV, that can cause things like mono and shingles. As it's uncommon for someone my age to just randomly get these. I've had so many tests: Cat scans of head and chest, countless blood tests, among others but nothing really comes up - it's been super frustrating not being to pin down why I am feeling like I am.

Also, I don't think it helps with him being taken seriously as an interviewer and entertainer when he's talking about snot and boogers so much. ""Kissing Potion"" is a bizarre old old old reference, like when he makes references to the ""Roller Skate & Key"" song from the early 70s.

I checked on the website and it said it was covered. I called and had them run a test claim to be sure. It accepted, no prior auth required, no rejection for age limit. Then I went back to the pharmacy and told them my insurance would cover it. They told me it was store policy not to give the vaccine under age 50. I called a different pharmacy and they said it was a state requirement that the pharmacist could only prescribe the vaccine if it was being used as labeled by the FDA, which meant they couldn't prescribe it under age 50, but my doctor could send a prescription to the pharmacy.

It's not the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, I mean, the worst pains of my life were awful but then it receded, eventually/mostly. But the shingles pain was not only ***bad***, it was ***constant***. I literally stomped my own toes to refer the pain somewhere else (didn't work). And I still feel it to this day if that area gets even lightly hit or poked (like while getting my hair cut or something). The rest of the thread that's saying ""anything is better than the shingles""... they speak truth. If anyone's on the fence about the vaccine, trust us, and don't be on the fence.

After a few weeks I did get a little relief from oxycodone(only 5mg taken as needed) and a nerv drug. Then shingles rash starting appearing. Shingles pain is extreme.

I thought I was using the wrong soap, or maybe using the wrong perfume. I finally decided to investigate and found out about postherpetic pruritus, which can cause itching in the affected dermatome. In my case, it was on my right upper buttocks when it all started (shingles + rash ), though, the itching can go from my legs, to my arms, shoulders, even on my back, literally anywhere you could possibly scratch yourself. Also, whenever I hurt myself, the skin will take way longer to heal itself and the skin won't get pale and finally disappear on the area where I got injured. I was actually wondering if any of you guys have experience/knowledge with these symptoms after contracting zoster.

They all just looked like dried skin and flaked off a bit. Then remembered I had been itching slightly but I assumed it was just dry skin so I'd switched my normal lotion to aloe and rice milk one and the itching stopped.

Something else to think about is that while there is no good treatment for Ramsay hunt caused neurological vertigo, if vestibular therapy is started as soon as possible, it has the best chance of potentially helping. Also if her vertigo persists long term, she can talk to a doctor about trying a benzodiazepine, klonopin worked for my father but it has a long half life so it can cause addiction and bad side effects.

What was your worst side effect? 2. How often do you have common cold and how long does it last? How different is it from prior being on Biologics? 3. How many times have you changed your biologic and what was the longest time you were on one biologic? 4. For the people in the US, are you worried about your insurance not covering it anymore? I don't think the manufacturer would cover the cost if my insurance denies, as I might be more than the income level they would offer assistance for. I would really appreciate any answers.

3692,"Not getting measles immunity?: 23 year old Asian female (5'3"", 104lbs). Currently only taking medications for allergies and getting allergy shots.

After that, I got 1 dose of the MMR, varicella, and Hep B vaccines. The next titers showed that I had immunity to mumps, Hep B, and varicella. Not measles. So, I got another dose of the MMR vaccine. The next titer showed I still had no immunity to measles. So, I got another dose of the MMR vaccine (office doesn't have measles only vaccines).

No medication other than birth control (demulen) Several months ago I was about to get Botox for my migraines from my neurologist but that morning my face started to tingle on my cheek. He told me he wouldn't do the Botox and he checked me for Bell's palsy. Then he thought I was getting shingles and told me to keep a look out for any rash. He told me if a rash didn't develop to go get the shingles vaccine (but neither the pharmacy or my family doctor would do it because I am too young). The next day the tingling moved to my scalp and nose and stayed for a couple days then left. It returns every other week it seems. It's really random when I get the tingling and I haven't noticed any patterns. I lost my health insurance (husband got laid off) so I didn't go back to the neurologist and my doctor kinda just said ""that's weird"" and didn't seem too concerned. It's getting annoying having to deal with the tingling. I find it hard to focus on things when the tingling happens... any ideas? Should I request tests?",0

3640,"Nursing Student Without Vaccines: I recently started nursing school in January with a relatively small cohort of 11 students. Yesterday we found out a girl in our cohort was most likely going to be dismissed because she wasn't vaccinated. I'm talking no MMR, varicella, meningitis, hep B, flu, etc. She filled out an exemption form but her (parents) reasons are necessarily religion based. Mom/dad did research years ago and they thought vaccines were unsafe. Assistant Dean of nursing told her yesterday there wasn't much they could do to accommodate due to clinical sites. The school seemed willing to accommodate but most our clinical sites wouldn't allow her there as a student nurse, let alone a student in peds or L&D. Her ultimate career goal is to work in L&D. She was back in class today and told us her parents plan to sue the school. Has anyone ever had a classmate in a similar position? Has anyone ever worked with a fellow nurse that wasn't vaccinated? I understand that one point she was a minor and did as her parents asked. As an adult I don't understand how she would be in a nursing role and not be able to educate patients on the importance of vaccines.",0

Was told by the inspector that some of the vinyl tiles on the bottom floor might have asbestos, but that its not a problem unless it gets disturbed. Didn't think much of it at first, but lately I started researching asbestos in general and found, on this subreddit, the following list of items that could contain asbestos: [<url>](<url>) * Pipe and boiler and duct coverings (thermal system insulation) * Roofing, shingles and siding * Floor tiles and vinyl flooring, backing and mastic * Vermiculite attic insulation * Plaster, cement, putties and caulk * Ceiling tiles and spray-on coatings (acoustic and fireproofing) * Popcorn ceilings & spray on ceiling textures * Textured paints * Heat-resistant textiles So basically, its in everything. Add that to the lead paint risk and I'm starting to think the likelihood of hazardous material exposure on essentially any DIY project that involves cutting or breaking things is almost certain.

5274,"Shingles Vaccine?: Short answer: yeah, a doc *can* prescribe it for you. You won't get it from a pharmacy or something like that without a script, FYI. Doubt insurance would cover it off label either (and it isn't cheap). Will a doctor do it? Maybe. a doc can give you a shingles or really any vaccine outside of the age ranges if they want to and feel it is warranted. But there is very little need to. Plus, it has not been studied in people under 50 (besides people 18-50 with certain medical conditions that compromise the immune system) so a doctor would need some justification for using it ""off label"". For people age 40, shingles occurs at a rate of about 2 per 1,000 person years, per the CDC. In other words, if you follow 1000 40 year olds for a year. It happens, but statistically it is fairly rare. One potential problem I can think of with getting it early is the protection may wear off by the time you reach 60-70 when the risk of it (and complications from shingles) is much higher.

I was covid negative (but have antibodies consistent with being vax/boosted), Lyme negative but had antibodies which was a surprise, and no other findings. Doc didn't have a lot of answers for me but to continue monitoring for other symptoms and to rest. I have the report from (quest diagnostics) and in the Lyme section I have two reactive bands and the rest non reactive. My GP was unconcerned since he concluded that I don't have Lyme disease. Does having antibodies on this screen mean I may be carrying it, may have been exposed, etc? I'm going to be contacting a neurologist(because of the shingles pain), and making sure that they are also Lyme aware. Are there other things I should be considering?",0
4448,"How soon after shingles can I get the vaccination: Because I sure as hell don't want this again! About two weeks ago, I got the worst pain I have ever experienced in my left lower back and hip. Went to urgent care and they said it was sacroiliitis, prescribed me muscle relaxer and prednisone. That didn't help at all so I went to an orthopedist who said I had sciatica even though I told him the pain was not going down my leg. Went to an acupuncturist a few days later (I was throwing anything at this back pain by then) and she mentioned I had a rash on my lower back. Next day it had spread around to my stomach on the left side and teledoc confirmed shingles and prescribed Valtrex. It's been a little over a week with this rash which seems to be subsiding but the pain at night is unbearable. I get that weird sunburn feeling which wakes me up and prevents me from going back to sleep. I'm going to go to my GP on Tuesday and hopefully get a prescription for gabopentin. Does the nerve pain generally last until the rash clears up? I'm so terrified it is going to turn into phn. So I don't get this again, I'm planning on getting the Shingrix vaccine, does anyone know how soon I can go get it? Do I need to wait until the rash is totally cleared up?",0
119,4 year old roof but major issues. Thanks new construction!!: Hello! So i noticed some water marks on my ceiling and called a roofing company to come take a look and the above video is what he made. I was never under the illusion that new construction would be perfect...but damn!! His company was recommended by my insurance provider so im sure he's reputable but its always nice to get differing opinions/thoughts/ideas so i figured id get some good info here. Im in North Carolina. It seems straight forward enough. Im just wondering if i should just get a new roof? Im not a slap a patch on the major issue and hope for the best with the other issues kinda person. Also...i can admit i tend to over react but these all look like major issues to my untrained eye!!! I definitely want to see if i can go after the builder for this. House is less than 4 years old. AND our roofs aren't supposed to be connected flat across like they are since owners are responsible for their own roofs i think a mistake was made there as well. If you notice in the background other townhouses have distinct separations. He said that i cant fix my issue without messing up my neighbors because of how the shingles are laid... FML,0

4444,"""Is this'minor roof repair' ad misleading? Looking for opinions on what'repair' really means"": I want your opinion about an ad that a person I know is running.

Next thing I'd like to know is what you think about my take. So my take is that this is misleading. ""Repair,"" whether minor or not, means, I would bet is true for most people when they read, means replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken. In other words, it means fixing. Sealing what needs sealing and installing \*new\* fasteners as needed seems like an extremely minor repair if they can be categorized as such.

5924,"Shingles question: throwaway account. My babysitter's (Alice) husband (James) has shingles. They have a 10 month old (Lily). Alice and Lily came in last Tuesday to watch my son, and Alice said she thinks James has shingles. Later that night he went to Urgent care and it was confirmed. Alice has had the vaccine for chicken pox, Lily has not because she is too young. My question is this, can i have her come again this week? I am immune (I had the chicken pox & had a titer to confirm my immunity a few months ago) and my child has had his first dose of the vaccine ( he is 2). Their 10 month old obviously could catch chicken pox, and i was reading that one can be contagious up to 48 hours before showing symptoms. Is it possible for the 2 year old to catch it? I don't want to spread it any further so i am tempted to not have her come until the incubation period has passed and their 10 month old for sure didn't get it. Thoughts? Thanks!",0

I thought it was some reaction to my deodorant. 1 week after I noticed a few bumps which I thought was acne around my shoulder blade. No rash. Still had the same irritation feeling in my armpit and around to my shoulder blade. 10 days after this all started I had my annual physical. My doctor checked it out and said looks to be a mild case of shingles. Said because of the timeline, the prescription wouldn't matter. He said it'll heal itself over the next 2-3 weeks. It is 2 weeks total (from the onset of symptoms) now and the red bumps are there. Just like 4-5 pencil eraser sized. No blistering. No rash.

I put it right on my resume next to my first aid and CPR training certification and had more than one family comment on how they appreciated it. Especially if you work with very young children these can be very important for their health. I also asked at interviews about their kids' vaccine status since I worked for multiple families and did a lot of shares. It was important for me to know and let other families know if anyone was not vaccinated for whatever reason. I'm not trying to start a debate on vaccines, but I felt parents deserved to know and choose for themselves if they wanted to be in a share with kids without vaccines. Have other nannies done anything similar or had any experiences related to them? How do parents feel about a nanny asking their child's vaccination status?",0

5631,"26 yr old female with chronic pain, desperate for input. Please help me.: I was diagnosed with shingles 2.85 years ago. Minor rash on my middle back (just below breast level). Never turned blistery, just some bumps the size of a couple quarters. No pain or itchiness or anything. Just the rash. I have a photo. 2 years ago I was laying down before bed. I went to stretch: twisted my legs to the left, my torso to the right, yawned, POW! incredible shot of pain to my left chest, on the underside of my left breast. Couldn't inhale without extreme pain. Nor talk. Nor sit. Vomited from the pain. Felt like someone had jabbed a pen into my chest and drug it towards my back with every inhale. Excruciating. I stayed up all night as each breath was torture. Eventually fell asleep the next day. The following few days I had extreme pain on my left side of my chest, and dull achey pain on my right side of my chest. I went to the doctor. He said I probably cracked a rib and there was no need to xray. The pain on my right side was probably just mental. The following 1.5yrs: The pain had hardly changed. Most days in the winter I couldn't walk more than 100yds all day. Couldnt perform normal daily activities. The summer months were much better, but was still met with many limitations. About 1.5 years post injury and 15 doctors later: I got a sweat test which showed lack of persperation around my front torso, in a band near my lower breasts. An MRI which showed a cyst at my T6 level, in line with my pain other than the fact that my pain is ONLY in my chest. Ekg showed nothing. Xrays look fine. Diagnosis: postherpetic neuralgia. I have a few questions. 1. How is my pain due to postherpetic neuralgia when the shingles rash was located much lower on my spine, had no associated discomfort, and occurred 6 months prior? 2. They believe it is a coincidence that the cyst is in line with my pain. But how does a cyst form in the thoracic vertebrae? I thought the thoracic vertebrae didn't move? Makes me wonder if I accidentally twisted and yawned too deeply and caused injury to my spine. Is this not possible",0
6082,"Questions about Ramsay Hunt treatment: My mom noticed her tongue tingling a week ago. It progressed into pretty bad nerve pain over the next couple days, and she noticed a rash developing on the roof of her mouth and then the next morning when she woke up, half of her face was paralyzed. She went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. She's on 7d of prednisone (60mg a day) and then it tapers, 7d of valacyclovir (1g 3x a day), and gabapentin (100mg) which she takes 1x per day (along with tylenol). Her pain gets slightly better each day. The rash is still there, though it's progressing through its stages. You can see subtle changes every day. Her facial palsy is still the same, but I know it can take a long time before improvements begin. Her follow up is in a couple of days and my question is: should her medication be extended? It seems like you want to catch this early and make sure to treat it the best you can to prevent as much damage to the nerve as possible. It seems odd to stop medication while she still has the rash (but I don't know). Wouldn't the best time to extend the medication be right now, instead of coming off of it and waiting and seeing? I just don't know if she should insist on a 2nd round of medication to her doctor or not. I'd hate to see her come off of medication and regress. Or if she should insist on seeing a specialist this early (and who would that even be? ENT or Neurologist?) Also, I was reading about potential harmful side effects from the medication itself, and I guess high blood pressure and stroke (she is in her 60s) is a worry when people are on prednisone, but what I read seemed to indicate that it was mainly a problem for long term use. I don't know what the risks are for high dosage short term use of prednisone and valacyclovir, and how that should be weighed. I've been reading about Ramsay Hunt as much as I can, but it's a lot to take in and keep straight. I want to make sure she gets proper treatment, and was hoping others could weigh in with their experiences. Thanks.",0

At this point I was thinking why didn't she have me do blood work to check for infections if blood was present in my urine. Well I research how to get rid of kidney stones and it says lemon lemon lemon! So I drank a shit ton of lemon water and 100% cranberry juice. Well a week later I develop a rash and think it's an allergic reaction. Rash gets worse and I develop a weird pinching pain by the rash. And see a new rash developing a fee days after that. I go to another urgent care and dr says shingles. I wish the first doctor would've asked more questions or done blood work.

7492,"Peter McCullough & Co did not ""establish a mechanistic framework"" for mRNA vaccine harm.: [<url>](<url>) McCullough recently published a paper in ""Food and Chemical Toxicology"" that posits biological mechanisms underlying purported innate immune suppression and harm from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, using VAERs to support their hypotheses of vaccine relatedness of noted pathologies. This paper proposes that distinct from COVID infection, mRNA vaccines suppress type I IFN leading to a cascade of deleterious downstream effects that lead to various pathologies they associate with vaccination based on VAERs report, claiming to ""establish a mechanistic framework"". This long review article presents many details about various biological pathways, but their links to mRNA vaccines are almost wholly speculative. In some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines. In fact, so much of their evidence is from papers on severe COVID-19 infections, not vaccination, much content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination. A number of places in the article seem to make stronger statements linking mRNA vaccines to some of these processes, but they self-cite a previous review article by senior author McCullough and do not reference any primary biological research making these connections. They suggest connections of these mechanisms to various anecdotal case reports for herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, optic neuropathy, T cell lymphoma progression, Hepatitis C reactivation, events not yet confirmed to be related to mRNA vaccination. The paper amounts to laying out a series of hypotheses about mechanisms of harm that may come from mRNA vaccines. Hypothesis generation is a valuable exercise, including in this context of understanding downstream biological effects of vaccination that might induce harm. However, not all hypotheses are equally justified. Some are well-girded in direct evidence from relevant studies, while others are more speculative and extrapolate principles from other settings, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 infections or other injected vaccines, as done here. Indeed the speculative nature of their exploration is implicitly acknowledged by the authors in their choice of wording throughout, including ""is plausible"",""one can speculate"",""might be a mechanism"",""one can hypothesize"",""it appears"", ""we expect"", ""could eventually lead to"", etc. It seems that rather than ""establish a mechanistic framework"", this paper simply lays",0

6372,"Everything you don't want to know about shingles: Here's what I learned about Shingles \- If you had chicken pox, there's a huge likelihood you'll get shingles and it will hit you hard when you're least expecting it. When I mention it to people over 60, I'm shocked how many say ""oh yeah, I had that too"". So my advice to anyone hitting age 60: Get the new shingles vaccine!!! The old one didn't work for me. \- I'm not a healthcare person or cdc expert, but from everything I've researched, you can certainly get this anytime your immune system is weak or stressed. Perhaps that can include the Corona vaccine, but from what I read, the vaccine doesn't really stay in your system, but rather instructs you system to create antibodies. I got the Moderna vaccine in late January, but shingles popped up in early May. \- I contracted Shingles while taking steroid pack for a rotator cuff injury that wouldn't heal after 6 months of physical therapy. I never knew that steroids are considered immunosuppressant. \- Here's how it began for me: I commented on some unusual effects during the steroids, such as my voice was weak, then body aches and finally my skin became super sensitive to the touch. My wife's in healthcare and said ""sounds like shingles"", but I didn't believe her because no rash at that time. \- When the rash showed up a day later... go to the doctor immediately for some anti-viral meds!!! I was told it was vital to do that in less than 3 days after the onset of symptoms and it will knock it out quickly (less than a week). My rash never got much worse than red bumps and initially didn't bother me much, however it extended in a line all the way from my armpit to my ankles. (Seems more common to others on chest area) \- THEN COMES THE PAIN!! Holy crap, I have never experienced pain like this. The doctor might ask you to rate it from 1-10. (don't bother to say something like 20). \- My pain kinda moves around and I also sometimes get electric-like spasms shooting down my leg.

However lately, it seems to look more like eczema herpeticum as per Google/this reddit? It is extremely painful, prevents me from uninterrupted sleep (which thankfully I am used to since I was on UPA), and has potentially spread to my down there.. This is accompanied with a fever, swollen lymph nodes, body aches and killer headaches which I take Advil to help with. I was prescribed Valacyclovir (anti viral pills), Fucidin cream for antibacterial help with the open sores, and have been told to temporarily stop using UPA until the study team determines next steps - This is the most painful skin condition of my life and I wouldn't wish this on anyone. *I'm wondering if anyone else had something similar to this and how long it took to recover.* I am worried that I won't recover from these unbearable symptoms because my flat warts have been continuously spreading, and I was told freezing all of them would take too long/be too painful.. I believe what triggered this viral outbreak was working 2 very long back-to-back days and having 4 hours of sleep in between - My skin was very bad at the time and I notice stress plays a big factor to my flareups. I scratch my face like an ape when I'm at my weekly-cyclical ""down"" moments, and I believe I opened myself up to being more susceptible to a virus. I do not believe I contracted herpes as a child, but",0
2563,"Nerve pain/ weakness with Levothyroxine: Hi everyone, been wanting to post in here for a while after trawling so many different threads. I started Levo 7 weeks ago for Hashimotos hypo as my TSH was at 8, previously 13, and I had been avoiding meds for about a year. I started on 25mg and had a headache, spacey feeling and fatigue for a few days. It seemed to subside somewhat until 16 days ago I suddenly got numbness on one side of my face, I could move it but it was definitely numb and had pressure in my head. The doctor suspected shingles but I've not presented with any rash. Since then, the numbness has been moving around my body increasing in intensity - I get a burning feeling in my foot and leg, weakness and heaviness, also get it in my arm, face - even my whole mouth the other night was burning, tongue and lips too. It tends to be worse at night. No doc has been able to put a finger on what it is, but sent me for an MRI of my head (don't get the results for 2 weeks). It seems to be some sort of neuropathy, that comes and goes, some days I feel mostly fine and others it's all consuming. The only thing that has changed in the last 7 weeks is me starting tining this medication and I even upped it to 50mg as my TSH at week 4 was at 2.3 but when tested it last week had risen to 5.2. To note - I've had all my vitamin deficiencies checked, my full blood count for virus or infection, no trapped nerves as assessed by an Osteo, even had my eye health checked due to the infrequent headaches, all clear. Has anyone had anything like this with their meds? Whether it's a side effect or my body still adjusting? Any advice or similar stories would be soo appreciated. Edit : I'm a 27YO female",0
3329,"Is this hives or shingles or something else? My symptoms are worsening by the day [33 Male]: **Timeline:** 4 days ago (Sunday) I woke up totally fine. I did a home workout outdoors with homemade equipment which required using a nylon strap wrapped around my waist area. Later that afternoon I started feeling itchy on my stomach, and then my arms and chest. The next day the itchiness spread to the rest of the limbs, as well as my face. At this point pretty much my whole torso and most limbs are covered in itchy spots, and as you can see my face is very puffy. **Medications**: 2 days ago I started taking daily 180 mg Allegra (fexofenadine HCl) for hives, and applying fluocinonide cream (topical steroid) and generic benadryl (diphenhydramine HCl) cream. And yesterday I took 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCl pills at one point. It's hard to say if any of these medications are having much of an effect, because I'm still very itchy everywhere **Existing medical issues:** about a month or two ago I started having kidney/bladder pain and suspect that I have an infection. I don't have health insurance so I haven't been able to get it looked at in-depth. I'm worried that this infection has escalated to a systemic allergic reaction. The itchiness starting just hours after my workout, as well as the location of the initial itchiness on my stomach makes me think the two could be connected. Maybe the strap was infested with mites that bit me? Maybe I rubbed against poison ivy/poison oak without realizing it? I didn't come into much contact with trees, only briefly at one point. I'm going to get some epsom salts and calamine lotion now and see if that provides any relief. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help",0

Can't get the second dose because my pharmacy is doing drive-thru only at this time. All other immunizations are up to date, including the flu vaccine. About a year ago, I posted elsewhere on Reddit about being fed up with reoccurring shingles: To save you a click, at that point in time, I was dealing with my third bout of shingles. ( [<url>](<url>) ) Since then, I've had four more outbreaks of shingles. They are always in the same place and (other than the almost 3 month healing time for the first time) take 3 - 8 weeks to completely heal. I now have a scar from where my shingles occur. While frequent outbreaks and scarring make me anxious about starting new relationships, what concerns me more is WHY am I having repeated episodes?!? They come back every 3 - 5 months (calculated from the date of healing) and I'm not sure if the nerve pain will ever completely go away, though it is much milder now than ever before. I asked my PCP if something was going on with my nervous system or immune system and was told that, while not common, some people just are unlucky enough to develop shingles more than once. Is this something I will just have to put up with for the rest of my life? Is this normal or is there possibly something else going on to make my body attack itself like this? Are there any tests I should be pushing for or a specialist I should ask to be referred to?

4015,"[UPDATE] I [21 F] was not vaccinated as a child and would like to be. Don't know where to start or how to approach the subject with my parents [50's M and F]: [Original Post](<url>) Firstly, I have to thank everyone who helped me out with information and guiding me to the proper resources! I learned a lot about my healthcare situation and how the system works and that needed to happen in a big way! I initially tried to subvert my insurance (and having my parents find out) by looking into getting my vaccinations at the health department at both the county I live in and the county I go to school in. While many of you said that most health departments will give vaccinations for free, this was not the case for me. I couldn't find anything within a reasonable distance that wouldn't cost me $400 + out of pocket. I eventually brought it up to my parents. I was **SUPER** relieved to hear that my mother is no longer an 'anti-vaxxer.' She admitted that she did worry about it when we were little and thinks they should be given to children more slowly and/or not in the combination vaccines for like 5 diseases at once. Whatever, I'm just glad she's acknowledging that people who don't vaccinate their kids are severely misguided. My parents were less than receptive at first, but I assured them that I would do my research and make sure I knew what was going into my body. I also mentioned to them that I had been looking into ways to get these shots without their knowledge, which really seemed to drive home how serious I am about this. After doing way more research than necessary, I was able to convince them to let me get my meningitis vaccine using the family insurance. This decision was mainly due to the fact that this vaccine consists of the bacterial surface proteins, not the actual dead bacteria itself. Again, whatever makes them feel better...(Though I, as a bio major, thought that was pretty neat.) Unfortunately, I was not able to convince them that I needed my varicella vaccine. Their logic was that ""the virus stays inside you and it could attack you when you're weak later on etc etc"" Luckily, my boyfriend (who is long distance) looked into the health department in the city he lives in and informed me that they vaccinate for very cheap or free. (It's family size/income-dependent and they ask that you give a little bit based on these factors",0

I need help. I grew up knowing I had chicken pox as a baby and told it's best to get it as a baby because getting it in adulthood is dangerous. But now there is a chicken pox vaccine. The catch is you have to get it every few years. I hear one side say get chicken pox as a baby forgo the vaccine and you're fine. Flip side is the vaccine I think prevents shingles in adulthood. If I remember right, having pox as a baby makes me risk for shingles? Is there really a right answer here? HPV. She said the vaccine caused terrible side effects in women. Mental and physical. I dont think I'm vaccinated here, but I am sensitive to medicines. Not that im asking if I should get it, so much as is her statement correct? Anyone here have experience with this vaccine? I am pro vax,but I also believe in avoiding unnecessary junk in my body. I have 2 step daughters and husband and I are talking about a baby.

3127,"Christmas research papers from 24 Dec 23: **The effect of PsA on sleep** Spanish researchers followed 247 patients with PsA and measured sleep quality (via PSQI), peripheral and axial disease activity, anxiety depression and fatigue and PsA impact of disease. Using linear regression, factors that could affect sleep quality were analysed. Poorer sleep quality was linked with being female, more joint counts and greater peripheral and axial disease activity, fatigue, anxiety and depression, functional abilities and disease impact. Pain and fatigue contributed 40% of the model's effect. Poor sleep quality was common but emotional factors such as fatigue and anxiety seem more important than inflammatory factors in effect on sleep quality. So... nothing particularly new here other than inflammation (flares) not being as important as we might think, and they investigated it very rationally.

A group of 21 European, Canadian and Argentinian gastro-enterologists, using UCLA methodology, discussed clinical scenarios to arrive at recommendations for the use of these drugs in immune-mediated diseases (which include PsA). It was considered JAKi use should only be considered where there are no alternatives in people over 65, those at high cardiovascular risk, activer or former long-term smokers, and those with increased cancer risk. However, age flexibility is recommended where there are no other risk factors and active counselling is advised for modifiable risks such as weight and mild hyperlipidemia or current smoking. It was felt a number of factors led to uncertainty on recommendations regarding cancer risk.

Just measuring tenderness in the right index finger metacarpophalangeal joint (the knuckle) could predict PsA remission with 67% balanced accuracy. I'm not sure what I think of that as 67% isn't a great score. Sometimes my right index MCP joint hurts, sometimes it doesn't and it does not seem to be related to other ""flare"" activity I get, which tends to focus on toes and hips.

Pictures: <url> A rash appeared on my left side 4 days ago. It itches a lot and very painful when something touches it / rubs against it. Not sure if it's related, but my back muscles close to the rash are aching quite a bit. I went to the doctor (dermathologist) the same day the rash appeared. The doctor said I had herpes. I asked if she was sure and maybe we needed to make some tests. The doctor said she was completely sure it's Herpes Simplex (which she also wrote in my medical card later on). She told me I needed to buy Zovirax (ointment) and apply it on the rash several times daily. She also made a cryosurgery on the rash right away--she froze the rash with liquid nitrogen. 2 days later, a smaller spot of rash appeared close to the original large spot. After another day passed (so today), another small patch of rash appeared close to the second one--see the pictures on the link above. The new spots are itching. Also, today the original large spot of rash started itching again. It continues to be painful to touch (which is probably due to the cryosurgery). I've been Googling, and I am starting to really doubt this is Herpes Simplex, as it normally appears around the mouth and genitalia. Also, judging from the pictures I've seen, the blisters should be bigger in diameter? What sounds more like what I have is Shingles (Herpes Zoster). The location fits, the photos fit... also, I've recently had a lot of stress at work, which may have caused the outbreak. The only problem is, I've never had chickenpox, which seems to be a prerequisite for having Shingles. Although, most likely I've been vaccinated against it as a child--in an Eastern European country, so vaccine quality is often questionable. Please advice me what to do about this rash. I don't really trust the doctor anymore, as she was completely sure in something that is probably a mistake",0
7576,"Dr told me Shingles without a rash doesn't exist, Now I could have Postherpetic Neuralgia, could I had/have internal shingles?: I've been experiencing debilitating nerve pain in the right side of my face for 8 weeks. As well as Nausea, weight loss, malaise, hearing sensitivity/loss, double vision. The pain started in my jaw then radiated to my ear, nose, eye and scalp. It began as searing/stinging pain that was worse in the evening but was present through the day. I suspected a sinus infection initially but had no congestion or runny nose at all, however there was blistering and scabbing inside the right nostril. The pain turned into a hot itching pain that made the effected area painful to touch. My eye was examined by an optometrist but nothing was seen at the time. I called my Dr for weeks with no result for a phone/in person appointment and was never physically seen at any point, however was told to look out for a rash as she suspected shingles. I then mentioned the blister that had formed in the tip of my nostril and the scabbing the went deep into my nose that had been present for weeks. I was then told that imternal shingles did not exist and could not be the case without a rash present externally at some point. I have a non urgent MRI scheduled for December. My Dr told me she believes I have anxiety and prescribed me with Pregabalin that also helps with facial neve pain, just in case I do really have it. I don't personally believe I have anxiety. I felt unsure of my Drs response and got a second opinion and was told that internal shingles or Zoster Sine Herpete existed and could be the cause of my pain. Though since my Dr denied its existence, testing was not possible. I'm now experiencing debilitating burning pain in the same area, always right side exclusively. The medication barely helps. The scabbing in nose is gone and there is now irritation and redness. I'm wondering if I had shingles and went untreated as its been 8 weeks since the beginning of the pain and am now experiencing Postherpetic Neuralgia, or if I'm still suffering internally. It could be something else entirely but not being seen causes me to think I'm not receiving a proper diagnosis. Also Pregabalin is also used to treat shingles nerve",0
226,"My first Horror Story: So, this is my first ever horror story that I started writing about 3 years ago when I was still in high school. I would love to know what you think and I would also appreciate constructive criticism. I have been working on this for a while and I haven't made a whole lot of progress, but I will hopefully come up with more to write. Thanks! Flesh, evil and suffering are bound together here; the remnants of long dormant, twisted entities rule this place. The wooden floors never creak. Evaporated lives and fading memories are hidden from what one would foolishly call reality. No flowers grow here, only weeds, grass, and trees. Houses crumble outside, cold and shockingly still. The truly lost find their way here, for there is nowhere else to go. Darkness clouds the sky and the sun never leaves the cover of the pale grey clouds that cloak the sky. 'Welcome to Orn' the sign with peeling grey paint reads on the road into town. You aren't on a map anymore, stranger. The wind crawls through the old trees' branches when you find yourself. All around you are empty, ancient houses, wood rotting, broken windows, and missing shingles. Dull. Dead. Grey. Alone. These words enter your mind's eye and flash out of your conscience almost immediately. No reaction appears on your face. Only a neutral, blank slate. The pavement beneath your feet is cracked, with random blades of green-brown grass poking through. There are no sidewalks, no lines painted on the road, or signs other than the one you find behind you. It says that you are now in Orn. What kind of name for a town that is, you do not know. Frankly, you don't care. There is a pharmacy, laundromat, and grocery up the road. These once well-used necessities are boarded up and locked, except for the pharmacy. You walk slowly to it. Your hair is stirred by a sudden, eerie breeze that rattles the trees and stirs up dead leaves resting on the street. The pharmacy is empty, but still has power. You look around when you step through the automatic sliding glass doors. What is keeping this place going? The backup generator should have burned through all its fuel at this point. You sigh faintly like an unchecked, accidental whisper, feet wiggling in your shoes in an attempt to keep them warm. The room might have a heating system, but it does not seem to",0
5052,"Almost daily headaches for 8 months: any ideas? :): Basically, as the title states, I have been having daily headaches for 2 months, which were 2-3 times per week for 3 months before that, and about once per week the 3 months preceding that. In addition, I have some malaise, neck pain, mood changes with headache, and some brain fog. I have *never* had an episodic migraine. However, this same set of symptoms happened to me for about a 3 month period about 3 or 4 years ago. Then, one day, I had a *really* bad headache behind my right eye, and the headaches were just gone. Until about 8 months ago when this started. I started seeing a neurologist, and we have been treating me for migraines (see data below on medications) while pursuing other possibilities. Brain imaging (see below) is mostly normal, with some slight findings. I have some nasal polyps, I saw an ENT, and he said that there is nothing to worry about there, and it is likely not causing the headaches. I mentioned to my neurologist that the headache is orthostatic in nature. It will typically get worse throughout the day, and improves if I lie down for about five minutes. However, once it subsides for the day, it subsides regardless of position. Got a lumbar puncture for possible CSF leak, and it was normal (see below). My neurologist doesn't think there is much evidence for POTS, Lupus, cranial hypertension, thyroid problems, or liver problems due to lack of evidence in bloodwork / imaging. Next step is to continue the medications (see below) to manage pain, and follow up with physiology about possible cervicogenic causes. Anyway, this has been going on for a while, and it is pretty draining, so I wanted to see if anyone had some other information or ideas to offer which might help me figure out what is going on.

About 2 weeks prior to being diagnosed with shingles I began having prodromal symptoms (aching, joint pain, extreme sunlight sensitivity, tingling, vaguely fluish). At the time I wasn't really sure what it was, I just knew something was wrong. Then, on Saturday 2022-05-14 (a day that will live in infamy!), I got home from my bike ride and discovered a hand sized rash on my upper right chest. I went to a quick care, was diagnosed, and started on the Valtrex regimen and 300mg/day Gabapentin. The following day I had a similar sized rash on my upper right back. By Monday it had spread to my right arm, inner bicep. By Tuesday it was all the way down my arm and into my palm. I ended up with a fairly significant amount of rash, although not heavily blistered. It didn't seem as severe as pictures of some people I've seen. The pain? Well, I can't imagine it could have been worse. My chest felt like it was on fire, my back itched intensely, but my forearm was the worst. All manner of deep aching, burning, stabbing pains. I tried all manner of remedies, nothing really helped. The rash mostly subsided after a couple weeks. There are still remnants visible, especially after a hot shower. I'm now left with the aftermath of PHN. I start each day with a base level of pain. My chest feels sunburned. My forearm has that pins and needles feeling, allodynia, and sometimes burning. My back sometimes is itchy, but has mostly resolved (a glimmer of hope!). By mid-afternoon my forearm usually progresses to varying degrees of deep aching and stabbing pains. For the most part, it doesn't impact my daily activities, it's just another fact of life. I've now learned to live with it and given up on trying to treat it. I was up to 2400mg of Gabapentin and 3200mg Ibuprofen a day until November, when I weaned myself off them. When the allodynia is particularly bad I'll wear a long sleeve compression shirt. I sometimes still use my TENS unit on my forearm. Not sure if it really works or",0

After the first round of Immunization history back in July, I got some messages saying I had some issues with a few. No problem I thought, I'll just go in and get the doses I need. However, my doctor said that two were likely in error because of my time abroad as a child: My Varicella and MMR vaccines. They gave me the one dose they thought I needed and a letter saying that they could vouch for my immunity. The school did not accept the letter, and recommended that I go back and get a blood titer for MMR and Varicella. So I set up another appointment a week later, go in, get my blood drawn, and await results. I got what I was expecting for MMR, immune, but for Varicella, I was notified that I was not, in fact, immune like I was told. Once again I thought that I would just make another appointment and squeeze it in just before the due date. Except that you need two doses 20 days apart. Which means my second dose will be passed the deadline. So I guess my question is will they be ok if I upload proof I am undergoing inoculation? Or will I be penalized in some way?

1130,"when jostled awake by stress, HSV-1 bursts into action, releasing a flood of proteins that jams the host's immune reaction to interferon signals from infected cells, effectively disarming the cells' alarm system. ""This happens in the very first instant that HSV-1 reactivates,"" explains Angus C. Wils: As with all herpes virus infections, HSV-1 infections are cureless and lifelong. The virus burrows into the nervous system, nesting deep inside the base of the brain, in an area of nerve cells called the trigeminal ganglion. ""These nerve cells represent a stable place in which a latent virus can remain unperturbed for years,"" explains study coauthor Moses V. Chao, PhD, professor of cell biology, and neuroscience and physiology. But how viruses emerge from this sanctuary has been poorly understood, in part because it's difficult to study ganglion cells in isolation. ""The ganglion is like a miniature organ,"" explains Dr. Mohr. ""It contains many different types of cells, including immune cells."" The researchers' solution was an innovative culturing technique ""made of nothing but neurons,"" says Dr. Mohr. ""It allows us to study the molecular signaling and circuitry in depth, without interference from other cells."" With a clear window onto the infected cells, the researchers made a startling discovery: when jostled awake by stress, HSV-1 bursts into action, releasing a flood of proteins that jams the host's immune reaction to interferon signals from infected cells, effectively disarming the cells' alarm system. ""This happens in the very first instant that HSV-1 reactivates,"" explains Angus C. Wilson, PhD, an associate professor of microbiology and another of the paper's coauthors. The findings may have implications for understanding other, more harmful pathogens that also exhibit latency, like varicella zoster, a herpes virus that causes chicken pox and shingles, and even tuberculosis and HIV. ""This work is very exciting,"" says Elisabeth J. Cohen, MD, professor of ophthalmology who is leading a federally funded, multicenter study of varicella zoster infections of the eye, a potentially serious complication that can result in blindness and chronic pain. ""When these viruses come out of latency, they can cause many problems,"" adds Dr. Cohen, who was not involved in the herpes simplex research.

I am looking to hear others experiences and possibly what you were told by your doctor if you happened to have spoken with them about your effects. I was diagnosed with shingles 2 days ago and immediately began my course of valacyclovir that evening. (my shingles is affecting the left side of my back/underarm/chest at my shoulder blade level.. if that info is relevant at all to anyone) After my 1st dose, my body felt excessively heavy (almost like gravity had become stronger when I moved) and I felt slightly weaker than usual. My head felt very cloudy and I couldn't really think straight. These symptoms lasted for roughly 2 1/2 hours and then I felt more normal but my head still felt a little fuzzy. After my 2nd dose I experienced the same symptoms stated above, but to a way less intensity and it only lasted for 20-30 minutes. My 3rd & 4th dose felt similar to my 2nd but for less time and even less intensity. Sometime after my 5th dose I noticed a cramping sensation in my left calf that I was able to relieve by elevating it above my heart for a bit. However, the cramping sensation continued on and off when my leg was down (I've been sitting at a desk doing school work every day). I also noticed a random pain & almost like a bubbling or twitching sensation in my right upper quadrant just under my ribs located towards the side of my body, not the front (my hypochondria thinks it could potentially be my liver, but who knows).

6335,"Mononucleosis mystery! (Can someone please help me figure out if I recently had mono? The doctor tested me for an Epstein-Barr viral infection, but I am confused by the test results).: I am a graduate student who studies (marine) biology; however, my understanding of immunology is very limited, so I'm sorry if the questions I ask are incredibly stupid.... This is a long description... my actual questions are at the bottom if this turns out to be TL;DR. I think the background info should be helpful though. I am a 24 year old (25 in May!) white female- 5'7, 160 pounds. I'm relatively athletic (ran two half marathons last year) but have been slacking off recently (MAYBE BECAUSE I HAD MONO? read on!) About 7 weeks ago, I was feeling 'off'. I was very tired and weak, and had an on/off (mostly on) slight headache for a few days straight. I'd get dizzy standing up, or my vision would get spotted and my hearing would get fuzzy or start ringing. It felt like the feeling you get right before you're about to pass out (I have passed out twice before after giving blood, so I recognize that sort of fuzzy feeling). I also had a few stomach aches. Because I get stomach aches fairly frequently, I didn't think too much of it. I tried drinking more water, in case I was just dehydrated, but that didn't improve anything. I complained (a lot) to my friends about being tired and dizzy (I cancelled a lot of plans and did practically nothing at work- yay for hiding in the office instead of working in lab!) to the point where they thought I was being a hypochondriac. They eventually were like, ""see a doctor or stop complaining"". I went to the doctor and they did some blood work (I was curious about whether I was anemic, dehydrated or pre-diabetic (I'm not fat, but I do eat a lot of chocolate). Everything came back normal, including my cell counts- all within the suggested ranges. The doctor visit fell towards the end of me feeling sick... I was starting to feel better at that time (somewhere around week 3). I have all these results in my email if they're helpful (but i doubt it, since they were all regular).

302,"What extended-term anti-viral would be best for rapidly recurring Shingles?: I'm 61M, 5'10"", 210 lbs., generally healthy. I got the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine in early 2021 and the Moderna booster a few months ago. I had a terrible case of Shingles beginning in early January 2022. The doctor put me on a one-week course of Famciclovir, but unfortunately only at the end of the recommended 72 hour window from the beginning of the outbreak. It got so bad shortly after I had finished the one-week course that I went to the ER when it had grown to a solid 3"" wide band across the right side of my back, covering my right underarm, and going across my right chest and 4"" down my right upper arm, and had also started to outbreak on the left side of my chest and the right side of my scalp. (The outbreaks on the left side of my chest and on my scalp subsided without getting very bad.). The doctor said it was one of the 10 worst cases he'd ever seen, and he didn't even believe it had also started to outbreak on my left side. Then in early February as the first outbreak was subsiding I started to get an 3""-long outbreak on the back of the left side of my head, beginning at the spine and heading towards my ear. I got on a one-week course of Valaciclovir promptly and that went away without reaching the surface of the skin. It's now about 8 weeks from the beginning of the first outbreak. I still have some minor pain and sensitivity in my back, underarm, and back of my arm. My question: I'm starting to have a stabbing pain in the center of my back which I am concerned is another outbreak. If it is another outbreak, I want to promptly get on an anti-viral again at a higher dosage and for a longer period. After having been on Famciclovir and Valciclovir with fairly good results, should I return to one of those or try Acyclovir? (P.S. I'm going to start taking Lysine daily.)",0
3508,"Can I expect this to get worse?: It's funny how many of the stories on here are so similar. Throughout most of last week I was getting headaches, upset stomach (never felt like I was going to vomit though) and would feel extremely tired randomly. I noticed a rash on my lower back Friday evening. I had played golf earlier and worn a new pair of pants so I figured it had something to do with a reaction to the detergent or whatever in those. It was mildly itchy so I put some cream on it and didn't think too much about it. Saturday it was basically the same. More cream with little to no change. On Sunday I was tucking my shirt in and when my hand pressed against my upper left groin area and I noticed it felt slightly bruised. This concerned me somewhat because it was directly over the area that I had previously had a hernia surgery done year ago. On Monday the pain above my groin was much worse. Not debilitating, but significantly increased. I was talking to a coworker and making a joke about how I felt like my body was ""falling apart"" and he said that it sounded it could possible be shingles. I got on my computer and immediately knew that's what it was. Very soon after that the pain started to increase. The ""muscle pain"" in my groin area wrapped around my side and ""connected"" to the area in my lower back where the rash is. It isn't excruciating, but it's getting to be extremely bothersome with some stronger jolts that don't feel great. Reading all of the posts on here it seems like everyone experiences different levels of pain/discomfort. I can live with the pain right now (although it won't be fun for sure), but I'm curious if I can expect it to get worse or if 3-4 days after the rash appears it generally is already as bad as it will get? I know everyone's different, but I'm wondering what the pain progression typically is for people. Does the pain peak within a day or two of the rash popping up or does it/can it peak several days or more after?",0

At first I noticed it on my lower tummy. Then I noticed it on the side of my waist. It's happening again but this time I have it in so many places! I don't know what's happening. I have it at the back of both arms, a bit on top of my wrists, I have it on both ankles, on the left shin close to the knee but not on the knee, a bit on right shin, on left thigh, on both my shoulders but more on the left one, a bit on my right chest, a bit behind both ears. I can see some very small blisters maybe filled with water on the skin. This reminds me of what I've been noticing on the palm of my hands lately, sometimes tiny blisters show up and I'm not sure why. It seems like it's growing every day and I'm not sure why. I haven't used any new product recently. The only thing I changed 2 weeks ago was a body wash but it's a product for sensitive skin (people with eczema and etc), it's called'QV Gentle Wash '. Since I've had something similar lately I don't think it's the issue. I haven't changed my laundry detergent, I haven't bought any new clothes really especially because of the Pandemic. I use the same shampoo. I did a lot of reading but since I'm not a doctor, I don't think it helps lol I've never had any skin issues till recently. I've always had good skin, no acne or anything.

Doctors (primary and neurologist) have no guesses about what's going on or what to look for and are telling me to ""Wait and see""...: 37M, 5'7"", 170lbs, mixed race. I drink alcohol regularly (10-15 drinks a week), I drink coffee (2 8-10oz cups a day), I do not smoke, occasional thc edibles (once or twice a month), other medications are anti-histamines, antacid, ibuprofen which are all as-needed. I exercise 3 to 5 times per week (usually running). More medical/general history at the bottom of this post. I have tried to give as much information as possible and I'm open to any advice, questions, comments or other. I am at a total loss as to what I should do and I feel like I'm going crazy, but I know that none of this is normal for me. # Why did I get an MRI: In the fall I had symptoms on my lower abdomen/right side of abdomen and around my back where my skin was sensitive/tingly to the touch. It was not painful. I have had this before and my doctors suspected it was shingles. This has happened multiple times over the years (probably once every couple of years) and I never developed a rash. Because of this my primary care doctor ordered an MRI of the thoracic spine and after a neurological exam the neurologist agreed. Four weeks ago I had the MRI with contrast (gadolinium). The MRI was clear, nothing that would cause issues according to the place that did the MRI and my neurologist. The skin sensitivity issue abated after a few weeks like it always has, but since getting the MRI, I have had other symptoms. It's possible that it's something else but the timing is very suspicious. # MRI Experience: It was an MRI of the thoracic spine, no images of my brain. I did feel like my eyes were trying to focus/unfocus while in the machine and I thought I saw some kind of faint visuals while the MRI was happening. It was a bit odd but seemed fine for being in a tight space with some surface very close to my face. # Symptoms since getting the MRI (beginning of January): Unusual/unsteady vision, Temple pressure, dizzyness/lightheadedness/unbalance for a few",0
650,"Help - worsening symptoms over time: I'm looking for anyone who might have advice for me. I, 25M was infected 4 years ago as the bottom in a gay relationship. I had an extremely severe initial outbreak including *within* my rectum. I'm sure someone has had it worse, but no one I've ever connected with. I thought I'd struggle to ever walk again, and I was a somewhat elite athlete. In the initial two years I took suppressive therapy, first aciclovir, then valtrex 500mg once daily., and it was highly effective. I was never able to go without suppressive therapy due to the severity of my infection. Over the past year, my need for valtrex is increasing to the point that I am prescribed 500mg every 12 hours and still suffer symptoms virtually all day, every day. It is decidedly getting *worse* despite more medication and making a huge effort to be healthy. I am curious about three potential changes to my treatment: 1. Having my antibody levels tested and if they are low, taking a break from valtrex to allow my natural immune system to respond and develop antibodies. The idea is, after building a natural immune response and resuming suppressive therapy, I may be better able to control my infection. Alternatively, I am considering asking my doctor about either: 2. Adding Famvir to my current regimen or 3. Trying Famvir instead of valtrex Has anyone had any experience with any of the three options I described? Or has anyone had nearly constant outbreaks and devised a way to help control them? **Once I have exhausted all options**, if none are effective I will attempt to gain access to the EAP for Pritelivir. I'd love to hear if anyone on here has succeeded in getting access to Pritelivir what their experience was. Thank you to anyone who responds or upvotes",0

What a horrible yet elegant privilege to know and understand all emotions so intensely...so deeply. Others will only be able to experience half of what you do, and only half of the time do you wish that you could be like them.""* Depression, to me, is a necessary illness that is experienced by too few. Like the varicella-zoster virus (Chickenpox), depression is something that, in my opinion, needs to be contracted by everyone, not only to give future immunity, but perspective. It provides, albeit dark, a view of the world and those around you that cannot be gotten any other way. Once people have broken free of the shackles of what seems like an eternal empty chill, they emerge with new eyes, and a broader sense of self and less apathy toward those around them. Depression isn't something you can understand without experiencing. It's like trying to describe color to a blind person, or orchestral music to those who are deaf. It isn't a shortcoming in language, it is a shortcoming in experience, which makes depression so deadly. It's like the cold, black, and windy dampness of a late night in autumn. You go outside and are met with the penetrating discomfort, and even if you are surrounded by people, in that moment, thinking of your environment, you feel alone. This feeling is only exasperated when you see others inside the house behind a locked patio door, socializing, unaware of your current state. And you sit there, nowhere to go, just hoping it won't rain. The hope is that, maybe one day, either you'll be able to go inside, or someone will spot you and offer a blanket and something warm to drink. Sometimes that actually happens, and it is usually with those that empathize with you. However, it is abundantly difficult to empathize with anyone when he/she is in a situation so foreign to anything you have experienced, which is why I believe that depression is a necessary evil to a better human existence that infects too few.

For those getting the paywall of doom: ""Merck, a global pharmaceutical manufacturing company, is adding 425 new jobs across North Carolina in exchange for $12.5 million in incentives. As part of its expansion here, the company will build a 225,000-square-foot drug manufacturing facility at its existing campus at the Treyburn Corporate Park in North Durham, where it will be manufacturing the active ingredients for the Gardasil shot, which helps prevent cervical cancer. That facility will take a few years to get to full operation, with many of the jobs starting in 2022. Gardasil has become an important drug for Merck in recent years, as the adoption of its use has increased across the world. About 30 more jobs will be added in Wilson County as well, with the expansion of an existing packaging center facility that has been in that city since the 1980s. However, despite the future plans for expansion, Merck's campus will see some job losses in the immediate future, the company said after the expansion announcment at the N.C. Biotechnology Center in Research Triangle Park. Merck said that it will be terminating its production of the varicella bulk production drug, used in chickenpox and shingles, at its Durham plant, leading to the loss of 150 full-time Merck employees and a similar number of contract employees. Merck is moving that drug line manufacturing to its facility in West Point, Pennsylvania, because the market for the drug has gotten smaller. ""The decision to stop varicella bulk production at the site is the result of changing market conditions that have made it unnecessary to make the product at two locations,"" the company said in a statement. ""Merck is committed to managing transitions for all affected employees efficiently and with respect for them and their families,"" the company added. ""Those Merck employees whose jobs are impacted will receive 60 days of compensation and benefits, in addition to a comprehensive severance package and job placement assistance.""

Of course we need to use vaccines against chicken pox, measles, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, and all the big nasties.

But what if we don't *need* **all** the vaccines being made now and **all** the vaccines made into the future? What if we're headed down a road of big pharma profit where it becomes compulsory for every vaccine that anyone can make a profit from becoming compulsory for everyone in the world?

What if big-pharma are behind these fake vaccine = autism reports and fake social media stories so that morons who believe them don't vaccinate and the traditional diseases like measles and polio come back and spread like crazy? Suddenly everyone has their pitchforks and are begging for laws to change and penalties to apply to anyone who doesn't vaccinate with everything - it's already happening. Then guess who's waiting patiently with billions of dollars worth of vaccines to distribute, and maybe some of those vaccines aren't truly necessary and maybe some of them are patented and priced to the nine? My best mate is a doctor (yeah, yeah, everyone knows a doctor) and I've known this guy for 22 years.

With the ones that aren't either the risk of infection is so minuscule or the vaccine itself is just rubbish. Yet it's illegal for him to say that to any patient or colleague. So I'm thinking why? Why the long list of vaccines (and getting longer), why make them all compulsory, why illegalize any qualified discussion, and why vilify anyone questioning vaccines? The answer I come to over and over is money. Anyway that's my two cents.

4870,"What Herd Immunity Is and Why the Theory is Flawed: The herd immunity theory was originally coined in 1933 by a researcher called Hedrich. He had been studying measles patterns in the US between 1900-1931 (years before any vaccine was ever invented for measles) and observed that epidemics of the illness only occurred when less than 68% of children had developed a natural immunity to it. This was based upon the principle that children build their own immunity after suffering with or being exposed to the disease. # Herd immunity was about natural disease processes and had nothing to do with vaccination. **-If 68% of the population were allowed to build their own natural defences, there would be no raging epidemic.** Later on, vaccinologists adopted the phrase and increased the figure from 68% to 95% with no scientific justification as to why, and then stated that there had to be 95% vaccine coverage to achieve immunity. Essentially, they took Hedrich's study and manipulated it to promote their vaccination programmes.1 # Why Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity is Flawed **If vaccination really immunizes, then your vaccinated child will be immunized and therefore protected against any disease an unvaccinated child gets. If he isn't, his shots didn't work.** The concept of herd immunity is often used as a way to push guilt at people who don't line up, with their children, like robots for their shots. From the point of view of protecting people who are already vaccinated, herd immunity is flat-out absurd. Little Jimmy, whose parents have decided not to vaccinate him, will pass diseases on to kids who are already vaccinated? Oh, you mean those immunized kids aren't really safe? **Then why did you vaccinate them in the first place?** From another point of view, herd immunity is the idea that people who ""can't be"" vaccinated (for example, those who are obviously allergic to elements contained in vaccines) will gain a measure of protection, if larger and larger numbers of others are vaccinated. The vaccinated protecting the unvaccinated. This is foolish, because **what actually protects people against disease is the strength of their immune systems, and that strength has nothing to do with vaccination.** If a person has a weak immune system, he will get dangerously sick, and it doesn't matter how many people around him are vaccinated against how many diseases. Even if one accepts the (false) premise that vaccines are effective and safe, the premise of herd immunity is ludicrous. There are",0

Senomyx notes their collaborators provide them research and development funding plus royalties on sales of products using their flavor ingredients. ""What they do not tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 - human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors"", stated Debi Vinnedge, Executive Director for Children of God for Life, a pro-life watch dog group that has been monitoring the use of aborted fetal material in medical products and cosmetics for years.

Campbell Soup was more concerned in their response: ""Every effort is made to use the finest ingredients and develop the greatest selection of products, all at a great value. With this in mind, it must be said that the trust we have cultivated and developed over the years with our consumers is not worth compromising to cut costs or increase profit margins."" While Campbell did not state they would change their methods, still their response, gave Vinnedge hope.

THANKS - CLICK NEW TO READ IN ORDER** This isn't about autism. This isn't about global ""population reduction"" reduction programs. This is about very real, and very frightening, mistakes that have made in the history of the development of vaccines. This is about the obfuscation of the early history of vaccination...obfuscation which continues to this day, and which has the detrimental effect of stifling a serious debate on this vitally important subject. Not only has the discussion on vaccine safety become completely polarized, but it also has devolved into a false dichotomy: you're either ""pro""-vaccine or ""anti""-vaccine; divide and conquer of two extremities, which has the extremely unfortunate effect of severely limiting the conversation. Sadly, many important topics today have fallen victim to this false dichotomy. Before continuing, I'd like to acknowledge a few books that opened my eyes to this controversial but fascinating field of research. The first is The Virus and the Vaccine, a fascinating true story of the contamination of the polio vaccine with a cancer-causing monkey virus (full text available here). The second is Dr. Mary's Monkey. Although I didn't use this book as a source, it's a thrilling story in its own right, and weaves together the JFK assassination, the contaminated polio vaccine scandal, and a secret project to develop a bio-weapon to kill Fidel Castro. Lastly, I owe much of this research to the indispensable Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners. The thousands of references provided have proved to be a veritable gold mine. The Audacity of the ""Anti-Vaxxer"" 40 years ago, vaccine reactions were almost never discussed. Vaccines were overwhelmingly believed to have saved humanity from a variety of diseases that had plagued mankind for generations. Although mistakes had been made, for the most part, ""the benefits far outweigh the negative effects."" Today, the accepted ""wisdom"" holds that although severe reactions to vaccines have been documented, including brain damage and death, they are rare enough that the success of the vaccine ""program"" is more important.

2169,"COVID Vaccine Uncertainty...: I hesitated to post this, because I feel like I may get a lot of backlash from people. But I really do want to vent about this, because it's to a point now where I'm losing sleep and having nightmares over the decision whether to get this vaccine or not. First and foremost, I want to say: **I am not an anti-vaxxer.** In fact, I've gotten the shingles vaccine and HPV vaccine (before I was ever diagnosed with endo) as an adult, and would totally be open to getting the COVID vaccine too, IF I felt 100% sure that I would be okay, both short-term and long-term. I don't care about the ""flu-like"" side effects - those, I can handle. It's the following thoughts/reasons why I am unsure if getting the vaccine now, is the right decision to make for myself. I have stage IV endometriosis, and am already in **horrific** pelvic/abdominal pain daily (my endo has come back and I'm about to have my third excision surgery in a few weeks). **Here's what keeps me up at night thinking**: 1) I don't know what the vaccine would do to me, when I'm \*already\* barely able to function. I don't know if I could be able to tolerate all the other symptoms I'm reading about that are happening to women with endo after receiving the shot. I already want to die from the pain. It's so bad. (Doing everything I can just to hold myself together right now...) Also worth mentioning, my period is currently 5 weeks late (and I'm **never** late - think it has to due with being around/living with vaccinated people, honestly... there's no other correlation). I can't tolerate another flare-up in addition to my regular everyday pain. 2) Long-term effects. My surgeon is one of the best excision specialists and reproductive endocrinologists in the country and he also considers endo to be autoimmune. I know it's not widely considered that yet, but I think in the near future, it will be classified as an autoimmune disease. From what I've read and have been told, there isn't enough research yet (of course) to know how the vaccine will effect people with autoimmune disorders in the future. 3) Women's health in general - I'm",0
7230,"10 Scientific Studies that show a link between Vaccines and Autism: 1.**Increased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in first month of life.** Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance, Vaccine Safety and Development Branch, National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 1999. Thomas M. Verstraeten, R. Davies, D. Gu, F DeStefano Background: Concern has risen on the presence of the ethylmercury containing preservative thimerosal in vaccines. We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Data link (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97. Methods: We categorized the cumulative ethylmercury exposure from Thimerosal containing vaccines after one month of life and assessed the subsequent risk of degenerative and developmental neurologic disorders and renal disorders before the age of six. We applied proportional hazard models adjusting for HMO, year of birth, and gender, excluding premature babies. Results: We identified 286 children with degenerative and 3702 with developmental neurologic disorders, and 310 with renal disorders. The relative risk (RR) of developing a neurologic development disorder was 1.8 ( 95% confidence intervals [CI] =1.1-2.8) when comparing the highest exposure group at 1 month of age (cumulative dose> 25 ug) to the unexposed group. Within this group we also found an elevated risk for the following disorders: **Autism (RR 7.6, 95% Cl = 1.8-31.5)**, non organic sleep disorders (RR 5.0, 95% Cl = 1.6-15.9}, and speech disorders (RR 2.1, 95% (1=1.1-4.0). For the neurologic degenerative and renal disorders group we found no significantly increased risk or a decreased risk. **Conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethyl mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment**, but not of neurologic degenerative or renal impairment. Further confirmatory studies are needed. 2.**Hepatitis B Vaccination",0

7021,"Installing panels on a low-pitched, nearly flat roof -- do I need new roofing?: Site evaluation was done. My home is a cape-style w/ a large dormer on one side. One of my roof is pitched at 7 degrees, which in their words, is relatively flat. The roofing material is a single layer of shingles that is roughly 9 years old. The roof is otherwise in great shape. Per the installer, they suggested removing the layer of shingles and replacing it with a different roofing material, which they called ""Liberty 2-ply."" Their reasoning for this approach is because there is a high risk of water damage. In situations of snow or rain, water can collect and pool on that side of the roof leading to an increased risk of water penetration. They explained that the panels itself and cause a capillary effect and draw the fluid up the low slope making it even harder for the water to drain down. Their suggestion is to replace the shingles with the 2-ply roofing material along w/ some underlayment and they can install the panels over it. Comestics is not a big issue since I can't even see that roof. They are quoting me a little less than $6k for this roof job (and they also mentioned that I can get 26% back through the federal incentive rebates). If I elect to not proceed, I would need to sign a waiver indicating that I have been informed of the high risk for leaks if I move forward with the solar install. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!",0
6060,"I'm immune to the chemical Urushiol in Poison Ivy and used it to protect myself and mess with my abusive family.: Growing up, I lived in a very abusive household. Constant yelling, death threats, swearing, calling me every female/ gay slur there is. They'd even threaten to kill my pets, and they did a few times. I wasn't allowed house keys and had to take the bus home. It was 3 hours before anyone came home. In the winter, I'd have to sit in the dog house with the dogs to stay warm. It was in the country. I stayed outside in the woods to avoid my family. This is where I discovered that I have no reaction to poison ivy. I don't have reaction to the chemical component Urushiol that's found in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. I can roll on it, rub it on my skin, lick it, nothing happens. I took poison ivy and rubbed it all over my room. I knew they we were going through my stuff. Them getting rashes, was proof. I decided to rub it on spots they commonly sat in. Watching them itch was very satisfying. After being left out of another "" family vacation"" and being told that no one wanted me, it felt like the final straw. I was 10 and left alone for 4 days. I gathered a bunch of poison ivy and poison oak and hand squeezed the oils out of the plant. I collected the oil and added the oil to all the shampoo, conditioner, and perfumes they used. Holy shit, they went through a couple months of hell with rashes and couldn't figure out why. We all used the same product and I was fine, so they figured it wasn't the shampoo or conditioners. They thought they developed an allergic reaction to the perfumes and never wore it again. It was so hard to keep a straight face and not burst out laughing. Maybe it was eczema. Maybe it was a new food allergy. Was it shingles or scabies? They couldn't figure it out. The shampoo and conditioner eventually ran out and they were back to normal. They still haven't figured it out. They never suspected me because they thought I was too beaten down and stupid to do something that elaborate. I also rubbed myself in poison ivy so when even they shoved me they got a decent dose of Urushiol. Edit: Love all the plant puns. I was a bit afraid to",0
6412,"Alcohol restrictions with Taltz (or any other type of similar treatment)?: Hi all - I've recently been officially diagnosed with psoriasis after many months of Derm visits. I initially was given all types of topical steroid creams and ointments that didn't really do much. I wanted to see if those would work before going down the route of the biopsy because I just didn't want confirmation that it indeed was psoriasis. However, had the biopsy performed and it indeed is psoriasis. At any rate, I spoke with my Derm yesterday about finally going down the route of an injectable treatment to hopefully alleviate my symptoms. I mainly have scalp psoriasis, and then a few isolated guttate type spots on my upper arms and calves. From what I've seen so far on the community is that my symptoms (excluding scalp) seem to be more minimal that what others have shown in images or in their text descriptions, so although it's still new for me to cope with, I can see how it may impact others more severely, so I guess I can't be too hard on myself as others have much more severe symptoms, but it is helping me better understand the condition and what others are doing to manage. Sorry for the long background lol anyways, my Derm ordered me to get bloodwork (next Tuesday) and is putting in for the injection Taltz. She explained the potential side effects and also to avoid people with shingles and live vaccinations when I start the treatment (after the all clear on my blood work). I've seen a few posts about other manufacturer treatments and comments regarding alcohol, and also some comments about the injections being painful. So my question is (because I didn't think to ask my Derm): are you allowed to drink alcohol while on the treatment? And does it hurt to inject? I also don't know where you are supposed to inject the treatment, so I'd appreciate any and all feedback. And last, I've seen some people talk about flare ups, how would you describe those? I'm honestly unsure if I experience them, so what's something typically to be aware of?",0
6087,"Shingles and acupuncture: I am currently into Day12 of my shingles bout (if I include the initial days where I only had nerve pain) and Day5 into my treatment. I would like to share my experience with acupuncture thus far. (If you think this is quack you can add to the discussion but don't have to attack anyone or me, I know that a lot of people think acupuncture is dubious.) Disclaimer: I understand that acupuncture is unregulated in most countries and what I have undergone may be vastly different from what is available to you. Background: I was suffering from nerve pain in my right arm for a couple of days, then the rashes on my right chest started appearing. Initially, I thought they were separate incidents because I was travelling so I thought the summer heat got to me and I strained my arm hauling the luggage. When I finally got home, I could hardly sleep with the blinding nerve pain and the rashes have spread to a length of roughly 3.5 inches. I returned to work for 2 days, relying on muscle rub (deep heat) to curb the pain. By Day7, I was not sleeping well and I thought I better see a doctor. Through googling, I realised it could be shingles. After that, I made the conscious choice of seeing both ""western"" doctor and my acupuncturist the next day. My acupuncturist has the good track record of treating my ankle sprains very effectively. I believed then my acupuncturist can offer good pain management options and I could rely on my other doctor for the oral medication. Next day, I went to the acupuncturist first as her clinic is usually very busy. She is a lecturer at a nearby college that offers TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) courses, more than qualified in terms of qualifications, has wonderful bedside manners and is awfully caring and upfront about her procedures. Like I said I expected her to help with my pain, but she convinced me that acupuncture is more than enough to fully treat shingles. (I did come across 1 research finding saying so the night before). So I decided to rely on acupuncture fully. She used sterile needles to puncture my blisters and applied a yellow paste to the area. She told me the pain will go away as the blisters heal. There is also a powder that I was supposed to mix with water to drink twice a day. I was instructed to apply the yellow paste twice",0
2514,"What's this rash on my leg? [Pic inside]: **Symptoms:** On my left leg only, just below and in front of my knee, is a rash that's approximately oval shaped and about the size of a bar of soap. It is red and sticks out further than the rest of my skin, either due to inflammation or something else. The rash has been present for approx. 3 weeks, but it's appearance has changed. Initially, the rash had a bunch of small, clear liquid filled sacs, but after a few days those dissipated and what's in it's place now is basically just a raised patch of skin that's red and feel rougher to the touch. It is very tempting to scratch, but I try to avoid it. If I do scratch it, eventually some of the red skin in the area will peel/flake off, but the underlying rash does not go away. The rash has been in approximately the same area the whole time, but potentially with an inches of movement (expanding or contracting) on the edges. **Potential Causes:** Allergic Reaction: Nothing has changed in my life from before the rash was present to after the rash was present that is a clear indication of allergy. I'm currently on no medications, my diet is unchanged. Contact dermatitis: This area of my body has not touched anything that the rest of my body has not touched, and that includes things like poison ivy. Plus, if it was poison ivy, my past experiences with it is that it would have been gone by now. Scabies: The rash very much does not really look like scabies, but more importantly, if it was scabies, I think they would also be present on my partner, who I share a bed with every night. Herpes Simplex: The rash does not look like a herpes simplex rash in my opinion, and if it was, it would be in a very unusual area for a herpes simplex rash. On a related note, I do get oral cold sores infrequently, but have not had any immediately before or during the rash that I remember. I do think I had a cold sore about a month before the rash. Herpes Zoster/Shingles: This would be a seemingly uncommon location for shingles, and in my mind also does not look like such a rash. I also got all of my vaccines as a child, which should mean that I shouldn't get this. On the vaccine front",0
3794,"Chronic rashes, extremely itchy - 3 1/2 years, no answers [Not Scabies]: Hello! 31 year old female here... For the last 3 1/2 years I have been struggling on and off with chronic skin issues. I randomly break out in intensely itchy rashes... areas of raised skin and small red sores that get torn open as I scratch. The most common/aggressive areas it pops up are on my elbows, forearms, stomach and outer thighs, though it can and has appeared in other areas. At first I thought it was potentially a result of extreme stress I was under... but it was affecting my ability to work, to sleep... Benadryl didn't help and I was tearing my skin apart. My primary care doctor prescribed medication to help with nerves, but it did nothing. Eventually, I found a dermatologist who diagnosed me with scabies, based on my skin and symptoms. I treated it and it would gradually go away for weeks before coming back. I thought maybe I wasn't doing a very good job of cleaning/doing laundry, even though I was near obsessive about it. We continued to treat it, over and over... Despite doing a skin biopsy later on, we never found definitive proof of it being scabies... (it pointed to being potentially bug bite related, but the area the sample was taken from was already healing & didn't reveal anything concrete) and no one around me ever showed symptoms of scabies, even living in close quarters with others. But the pattern seemed to ebb and flow with the treatments, so we assumed it was just a stubborn case. After about a year and a half of monthly flare ups, it slowed down to a flare up that would stick around for a few weeks with months in between. However, this recent flare up has been getting progressively worse since March and shows no signs of fading. Feeling stuck, I started looking online... none of the common conditions involving chronically itchy skin looked or sounded like what I've been experiencing. I had always been fairly sensitive to bug bites, but I never had issues with dry or sensitive skin... no issues of psoriasis or eczema. Hell, I was even treated for chicken pox, as I'd never had it before, as a way to just rule things out, but it didn't do anything. It's definitely not shingles. The only thing I've found that sounds and looks similar is dermatitis hepetiformis. Realizing this",0

5102,"What the hell is this rash????: I'm going crazy over this stupid rash. I am 25 and female. I'm 5'4"", 140 pounds. This issue has been going on since mid/late December. I am on mononessa birth control, concerta, and lamictal. My boyfriend is 28 years old. So since mid/late December my boyfriend and I have been getting these small red patches on our skin. They itch. They come quickly/randomly and leave pretty quickly too. They are not raised, just flat red patches. We had switched detergent in December and the rashes started. We thought the rash was maybe a reaction to that. My boyfriend visited two Urgent Care doctors who both agreed that it was not any sort of bug bite and both said it must be a contact rash. I also visited my own doctor (a month after because the issue persisted) and she said the same... not a bug bite, nothing like shingles, must be a contact rash. We have washed everything in the old detergent probably 5 or more times. For a while neither of us got any of the bumps, like maybe a few weeks. Then about a week and a half ago we started to get them again. They definitely are not as bad as when we first got them, sometimes waking up with several all over. I mostly got my bumps on my trunk, upper legs, around my boob area and a few on my lower back. They usually would disappear within the day or the next day. Now I wake up with one or two, sometimes none at all. My boyfriend has woken up with one or two new ones almost every day, but his also disappear quickly. We have gotten prescription cream (I don't know what it is to be honest) but it doesn't really seem to actually do anything. One thing that is odd (and also makes me more certain it is not a bug bite?) is that sometimes in the middle of the day a red patch appears, or I'll have a spot in the morning but it's gone within an hour. Like today I had none on my body when I woke up. Went to work, went to the gym, and afterwards when I shower there is a bright red one beneath my boob, and a HORRIBLE patch on my back. The patch on my back is the worst I've ever had. I included pictures of both. Keep in mind that I probably scratched my back before the picture so some of that",0

I'm now 24 and you would think I'd have this figured out by now, but I don't. I've separated myself financially from him completely and my parents are now divorced so I rely on my mom more for support at this point but I still feel a need to have a positive relationship with my dad. **Some History:** I grew up with my NDad and my EMom, and flipped back and forth between being the golden child and black sheep until the last few years where my dad has sort of given up but the cycle of abuse never really ends. I think the only reason my dad took this long to give up on my potential for being the golden child is because my other two siblings are mentally disabled and probably will never be fully functioning adults, in his eyes I'm sure I'm the only child of his that has any hope of being what he wanted out of at least one of his kids, and I'm squandering it by not doing what he wants. As long as I can remember, I've been stuck in this cycle of.. pain? If I do what he wants, of course I'm showered with gifts, affection, and approval but if I do anything that I want to that he doesn't like, he'll always find a reason to disapprove of it. Lately his reasoning for disapproving is usually unrelated to why he's really upset. For instance, I often withhold telling him things I know he'll react negatively to until I think the time is right and instead of making it about the issue he disagrees with, its more about how ""dishonest"" I was with regard to withholding the information. However if I play the opposite card and tell him right out of the gate, he finds some other reason to be upset and it still becomes an altercation so I don't feel like I can win. Because I know I can't win either way, I have a habit of just not telling him things and hoping he doesn't find out which doesn't always work and becomes an issue. To give some history, my dad grew up in a very abusive family and I'm certain my grandmother on his side was narcissist in the same way that he is while grandfather was the enabler in",0

It was the first time since the \*world events\* that we saw them, we were excited and we were looking to enjoy family time together. We were all living in the same summer house, having lunch together, doing activities together etc. My family is composed of my mother (68F), my sister (42F), my stepfather (69M) my BIL (44M) and my nieces (12F and 7F). My father is doing his thing on his side and I have a good relationship with him. We visited him with my wife, my sister, my brother in law and my nieces, we spent the day with him at the beach.

4647,"Long term Ramsay Hunt effects?: This contains a bit about my Ramsay Hunt journey also for those interested or going through it. On the 1st December I noticed some pain from my ear to my jaw. I'd been getting over a cold and felt like it was probably a middle ear infection. Over the course of a week, pain in my ear increased, including stabbing pains so I went to my local walk in centre where I was diagnosed with an external ear infection and sent away with a prescription for antibiotics in pill and spray form. By this point, I'd noticed some small boils in my ear. Over the course of the next few days, my ear pain seemed to subside but was replaced by the most excruciating migraines I've ever experienced, and I am prone to them with auras. I've had two babies, and can honestly say the pain was worse than anything I encountered in labour. Two days later the pain was beginning to subside, but my ear still felt tender. I went to bed finding my eyes a little hard to keep shut, but thought nothing of it. The next morning, my eye and mouth felt weird but I couldn't explain it. Then when I went to spit toothpaste I noticed half my mouth hadn't pursed, and looking up at the mirror saw my eye was no longer blinking on that side either. I hadn't connected any of the symptoms, so I assumed I was having a stroke and rushed to accident and emergency. It was now the 14th December. Once there, I mentioned everything including the boils in my ear and was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt and given a 25 day course of tapering steroids starting at 60mg and antivirals for 5 days. Through my own research and reading stories I realised that recovery might not be complete. My eye had to be taped shut and I used an eye patch at night and when out.

I have top lip symmetry, am starting to be able to whistle and puff my cheeks, and my eye blinks on its own, albeit a bit slower.

3255,"An eyewitness account of 13th of July, 1931.: This eye witness account from the book Kashmir Kee Tehreek-e-Azadi, Khawb, Azaab Aur Sarab, that is based on the notes of Pir Mohammad Afzal Mukhdoomi. The authoritative account offering context and subtext to the Himalayan development in Kashmir's history suggests it all started with pellets and was followed up by rumours that created stature of leaders. The first bullet was also fired by a Kashmiri. Maharaja Hari Singh had no successor from his first wife. So in 1930, he married a Kangra Rajput. Within a year, the Maharaja was on way to Paris to ensure proper medical care to Maharani. In March 1931, the heir apparent Dr Karan Singh was born. It was a major development and triggered massive official celebrations. Punjabi Muslims took out a procession and sung songs to thank God and praise the family. But there were tensions after a Pandit capitalist Bal Kak, then Wazir-e-Wazarat, sent a telegram to Maharaja congratulating him on behalf of ""Hindus and Muslims Chakdars, landlords, Raees's and the subjects"" on the birth of Rajkumar. This was strongly resented by the Muslim bourgeoisie. They saw it a challenge to their status. So they created a front with the sole objective of sending their own telegram. The entire Muslim bourgeoisie met at the residence of Zaildar Pir Sahab. The idea was to congratulate the Maharaja and also draw his attention towards the status of Muslim subjects. In the first meeting, it was decided that a telegram needs to be sent. By the second meeting, the draft was readied. In both the meeting, a young man, whom people identified as Mohammad Abdullah, resented the telegram. In the second meeting actually, he was fierce in his reaction that shocked the bourgeoisie. Eventually, the draft was ready and it included a ""request"" that once the Maharaja is back home, they will host a high tea in either Nishat or the Shalimar garden, where, they will also make certain demand on behalf of the Muslim subjects. Maharaja got the cable when he had reached Bombay. He rejected any invitation in which there will be demands. Kashmir's Muslim elites were crestfallen. When Hari Singh left with his wife to Paris, he handed over the charge of his government to a Board. Led by Prime Minister GEC Wakefield",0
4279,"More Effective or Safer Options than Humira?: I was on Humira for about the past 10 years. Still have symptoms of Crohn's and Colitis (GI says i have ""Crohn's-Colitis""). Pretty even keel 10 years until about the last six months. My liver enzymes came back quite elevated on routine bloodwork. Had them checked again and they can back down. But i had a ultrasound of my liver and all was good except for the fact that it is enlarged. GI said to not worry about that. It can have a slight ache/tender to the touch when i push in that region which concerns me. Might be a bit psycho-somatic though. Then 3-months later i get my first back of pretty severe abdomen shingles. I stopped my Humira during this outbreak and haven't been on it since. Once the shingles resolved (a month) I have actually felt pretty good for the past three months not being on Humira. I have continued to take my Lialda/mesalamine pills. I think i am at that point where i need to stop pretending i don't have these auto immune diseases and get back on biologics. But a bad case of shingles and potential PHN is enough to scare someone, and I'm wondering if Humira is hurting my liver as well. So, Reddit Crohn's friends...just asking for your opinions and advice...time to get back on the meds? Am i feeling ok because of residual effect of years on Humira and staying on my Lialda? Ever worry about your liver while on biologics? And biggest question...is there anything better than Humira out there these days? I don't care about the shot vs pill. Shot is nbd to me. By the way, i also have ankylosing spondylitis so Humira technically is a 2 for 1 drug for me....just didn't appreciate the shingles and i don't feel like it does a lot, at least symptoms wise. Sorry so long and Thank you!",0
6549,"26 year old male, generally healthy, diagnosed with shingles: Hey. Just making this post because I checked this subreddit over the weekend when I became pretty concerned that I was getting a case of shingles based on symptoms and appearance of a rash, and saw that a fair number of other younger people are going through the same thing. As the title says, I'm in decent health, no real autoimmune disorders but for seasonal allergies and eczema, I do have some gastro issues, hemorrhoids and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. Tonsils came out 3 years ago due to inflammation. I had a minor reaction to the 2nd HPV shot involving muscle twitches when I was 20, didn't get the third, but no qualms about it. I am HSV-1 and HSV-2 negative, per a recent routine STD test. I received my 2nd Moderna dose on March 26th. About a week and a half ago I started having symptoms of allodynia on the left side of my stomach and back, my skin felt hypersensitive and was uncomfortable from clothing or touch. After a few days, I woke up with a rash. By Friday it was blistery and looked very herpetic in nature, and I felt pretty sure I had shingles. Yesterday, a few more dots showed up on my side causing more pain and itching than the first splotch. This morning, I was able to get an appointment with my derm because of a lucky cancellation slot. Got there, explained that I probably have shingles, he took one look at it and confirmed that it was shingles. I have a prescription for Valtrex now and it should be a mild case. Just wanted to share this story for any other young people who might also be going through this. Not really sure how I got hit with it, but so it goes. I will be reporting the event to the CDC VAERS database, but I also hope this post does not discourage anyone from receiving their vaccination.",0

As my GI put it ""need to make sure you don't have a virus that could kill you if we put on this med"". It can be very dangerous & possibly need hospitalisation if on Aza and you get (re-)exposed to or develop chicken pox (again). When I started Infliximab the bloods were repeated plus TB added. It's estimated about a quarter of the world's population has latent (not active) TB, many people won't ever know unless tested. Infliximab can trigger it to become active which is not good as active TB is highly infectious (& very deadly if you don't get it treated). I unexpectedly tested positive for TB, no idea when I was exposed as haven't been to any high risk countries and my country is very low risk. So got referred to infectious diseases, got a chest xray and had to go on three months of strong anti-TB drugs that can fry your liver (so more frequent blood tests needed) plus they interact with a lot of other drugs esp if they're processed by your liver including many antihistamines and pain relief. Was not a fun time and four days after finishing them I got Covid but hadn't been off the anti-TB meds for long enough so it impacted the antivirals I could get. I would've rather had a vaccination than go through that drama.",0
4032,"New to the group, sadly: Hi all, I need to write down my story, in the hope that it will help me heal. Usual warnings included. TW. My first loss was in September of 2017. I was 8 weeks and was told I had a blighted ovum. Never heard a heartbeat. At this point, we had been trying for 5 months, and the silver lining was that my body was able to get pregnant. I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 14, and had been on birth control pills from that time up until we started to try (almost 20 years). So it was interesting to see how my body would react. Anyways, since my body did not recognize the loss by 10 weeks, I opted for a D/C. 4 months later, with the help of stress and a shingles outbreak, I got pregnant. Thankfully, by God's grace, this was a healthy pregnancy, and gave me the little love of my life. But the stress of a previous loss, I never felt that I was out of the woods until she was in my arms. When she was about 18 months, we decided to start trying again. I finally got my positive pregnancy test on Feb 1, about 6 months after we started trying. I was cautiously optimistic. I told my DH, my parents, and we were going to surprise my in-laws in a few weeks when we saw them in person. Well. On 2/8, I started having right sided pelvic pain. Intermittent, mild. Worse in the evening, and I just thought I was constipated. The next day, the pain was worse. It was so bad it made me limp on the right side. I felt like it was pulling my right leg up. Called my OB, her nurse said it was probably ""right ligament pain"", take some Tylenol, apply some heat, stretch. If it's not better, go to ER. Worked a normal shift, but when I picked up DD, I was extremely uncomfortable. That night I couldn't sleep. I was in pain, nauseous from how much pain I was in. So at 2 AM I went to the ER. Thankfully, there was no one on the road at 2 AM, because I was driving 10 miles under the speed limit. Every little bump on the road felt like my insides were tearing open. Little did I know how true this was. My ER doc said, there are three possibilities.",0
3972,"Being suspicious about an assessment and priscription of a neurologist in Thailand.: Hey there, I'm a white guy in my mid twenties and am currently living in Thailand. About my (possibly) related medical history: I have a history of migraine attacks (with a visual aura) about once a year and in two instances I had herpes zoster (once quite badly when I was about 16 and one minor case about 3 years later). Both seem to be stress related, because the migraine attacks appear, after periods of intense stress and the shingles where both times during a critical exam period. For abour three weeks, I've experienced pain on the right side of the top of my head, when I apply pressure on a certain spot. It feels similar to the pain of a bruise. I don't feel anything, if i just rub or scratch that area, but when I push a bit harder, I feel quite a'strong' pain (about 4/10 if migraine is a 8 or 9/10). During the past 3 days, I started to occasionally (about 4/day) feel a sharp pain in the same region, which only lasts for a second or two and then goes away. I also had two or three similar instances on the left side of my head, however a bit lower, about two inches above my ear. I also have a bit of a hangover feeling in my head. I just feel a bit lightheaded and slightly dizzy, a bit like being dehydrated. Yesterday I went to the hospital to get a professional opinion about these symptoms. I am a bit sensitive about these things, since there've been a few cases of brain tumors and similar things in my surroundings lately (Not in my family!). The doctor spoke decent English, but I'm not sure that he understood everything 100%. He checked for symptomes of meningitis, checked my eyes and vision (something about the eye pressure and my ability to follow his finger) and asked me several questions about the pain. He came to the conclusion that it's probably not coming from inside my skull but from outside, because the pain I was describing would be untypical for a problem in the brain. He told me that I most likely have an inflamed nerv canal or something similar and that he would give me medication against the general headache and dizzines, as well as something against the inflamation - and told me that I should come back, if it hasn't improved within 3 days. The medication he prescribed is",0

5695,"What's the longest a flare up has lasted for you? I'm about to hit the 2 year mark.: Hi everyone, like the title said, I'm (35F) about to hit the 2 year mark since my symptoms first began. And in that entire time I'd say I've only had about 2 months (not in one stretch though, but rather a week here, another two weeks there) where I've thought I'm finally coming into remission, usually after completing a round of treatment. But then wham! My BMs start to loosen up again, and before too long there's blood again. Now part of the reason it's dragged on for so long is that it took a while to get an UC diagnosis. For the longest time they thought it was internal hemorrhoids, despite a family history of UC. Then I switched doctors because I wasn't happy with my first one, so that also delayed things. But I've been with my current gastrointerologist for 6 months now and I'm still presenting the same symptoms as Day 1, mainly blood in my stools and fatigue. There are secondary symptoms though that I think are caused by all this, like major hair loss and I'm sick all the time. In the last two years I've had shingles, boils, bronchitis, the list goes on. My UC is thankfully not too severe. It's limited to just the rectum, I don't have any cramping or pain, and I'm not losing too much blood. Basically because it's not a terrible case, my doctor has been putting me on steroids and mesalazine rather than immunosuppresants, since he thinks the side effects of those could be too much. Has anybody been in a similar position? I don't have the worst case of UC but this has dragged on for so long and I'm so tired of being sick and tired all the time. I'm thinking I want to try an infusion or something, just to see if I can put an end to this never-ending flare already. Or is this normal and should I just keep sucking it up until we find a course of treatment that works?",0

7672,"Efficacy of Covid vaccines in immunosuppressed folks - new data: I have been keeping an eye on the research into whether Covid vaccines are effective in people using immunosuppressants. There is a fair bit of data out there on the impacts of various medications on the efficacy of traditional vaccines (flu, pneumonia, shingles, hep) but the mRNA vaccines are new. The early letters/findings were indicating that folks on certain meds (methotrexate, rituximab) were not mounting a great immune response. This is seen with other traditional vaccines as well, and doesn't mean anything for people on TNFi. I'm on Humira so I've been looking out for data on TNFi patients specifically. I just found two articles that make me feel better. Keep in mind: 1) no one knows what antibody levels are needed for full protection from the illness. It is thought that some antibodies give some protection, and more would give more, up to a point. There is a level that would be considered great to cross, but no one knows what that level is yet. That's why post-vaccination antibody testing is not being offered for us yet. 2) immunity is about more than just antibodies, there are plenty of other immune response factors not measured here. But again, no one knows what is needed when it comes to Covid yet. [<url>](<url>) >**Methods:** 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years).

2014,"Bacterial infection of the eye can cause Shingles as a result of a process occurring with phagocytosis: Interferon gamma suppresses VZV replication. Interleukin-4 can block interferon gamma, allowing virus replication. This has been shown specifically under the circumstances of Helminth worm infection. It is postulated that this occurs due to an interaction of IL-4 and it's effect on neutrophils. Neutrophils step back and become quiescent due to IL-4R signaling. Neutrophils are typically the first non-resident immune cells that arrive at a site of inflammation. Upon local activation of the vasculature, endothelial cells present chemokines and cell adhesion molecules at their luminal side. These ligands are recognized by their counterparts on the surface of bypassing neutrophils, leading to deceleration and eventually firm adhesion of the leukocytes to the endothelium. The neutrophils then crawl along the vessel wall following fixed gradients of so-called intermediary chemoattractants, particularly CXCR2-binding chemokines, before they transmigrate through the endothelium into the interstitial space. There, they advance to their destination by tracking gradients of other chemotactic stimuli such as N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) released by bacteria (12, 13). These end-target chemoattractants override the signals emanating from intermediary chemokines (14). Once they reach the site of infection, neutrophils employ various mechanisms to kill or inactivate pathogens, including phagocytosis, degranulation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neutrophils extracellular trap (NET) formation. In the case of Zoster Opthalmicus, a granuloma is formed around the invading bacteria in the lid. Given the abundance and readiness of these heavily-armed immune cells, overshooting neutrophil activity can lead to detrimental tissue damage. Thus, mechanisms need to be in place, which keep neutrophil responses in check but at the same time allow efficient clearance of pathogens. Although neutrophils have traditionally been associated with type 1 and type 3 immunity, they have recently been found to contribute to type 2 immune responses, thus also aiding in the removal of helminth parasites. Conversely, neutrophils are often conspicuously absent from tissues where the type",0

I am very happy to finally have a diagnosis after a long journey and am looking for some advice from others with UC on treatment options. **My long road to a diagnosis:** I started having mild symptoms about four years ago and kept bringing it up to my GP. My GP never took it seriously and dismissed it as diet related. About 1.5 years ago my symptoms started getting much worse. So after seeing my GP several times, he sent me for tests which showed I had a highly elevated level of calprotectin and said he would send a referral for me to a GI doctor. Well months went by, nothing, I called my GP and he said he would submit a referral. This routine went on every 2-3 months for 1.5 years, still nothing, no response about a referral. The entire time, my symptoms continued to get worse. For the last year I have experienced non stop diarrhea (basically water every day), 12+ trips a day to the washroom, constant bathroom emergencies, bleeding 2+ days a week, struggling daily to stay hydrated, getting up 4-5 times every night to go to the washroom, etc. If it was not for being allowed to work from home due to Covid, I would have never been able to hold down a job this last year, since going to an office was not an option. Every day was a struggle to get from the bed to my work desk, to the couch and back to bed. Just unable to do anything else.
