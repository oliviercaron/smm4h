Loading model for classification from: results_LLMTRADPARAPHRASE_simcse_xlmr_base
Some weights of XLMRobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at results_LLMTRADPARAPHRASE_simcse_xlmr_base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
