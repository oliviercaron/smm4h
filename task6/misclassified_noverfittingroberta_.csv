1st shingles shot over 72 hours ago and still fatigued: Thank you for the advice and warm words. I so would rather have the 2nd shot and have a bit of awfulness than what I've heard from friends that have know people/relatives that are older who have had shingles and the pain they've gone through. What I went through with the first shot sucked eggs but nothing compared to what I've heard people who've had shingles have suffered with. Thankfully when my son had it he was young so it wasn't as bad for him. I'm just hoping it's not an ongoing thing for him as he gets older.,1,0,0.88250816,0.11749187,False Negative

"Shingles or Gypsy Moth Caterpillar contact?: Hey everyone, I'm 42/M residing in York Region, Ontario, Canada. In the past few weeks we have gotten a lot of gypsy moth caterpillars. They're everywhere. About a week ago I felt a tingling on-and-off throughout two or three days (but no visual issues) on the front side of the band area/crease between right thigh and hip. It slowly made its way around the hip to the side and kinda on the back as well (right side again). Then I started noticing pink spots appearing after the two or three days. I chalked it up to somehow getting an unfortunate encounter with a gypsy moth caterpillar. The pink spots, over a day or two, on the front thigh/crease area, began to blister. They're not bubbled, dark red coloured, some have popped (not by me scratching at them tho). There are also relatively new patches/clusters of spots, much smaller compared to the initial/main cluster, that are now on the right hip as well as lower-back, slightly right of spine (i.e. same side of body as the other patches). Does shingles do that? Show up in patches at different times? or is this really just an unfortunate contact with gypsy moth caterpillar? EDIT: I also got first dose AstraZeneca vaccine on April 27th with very minor side effects (mild body aches for an afternoon, the day after getting jabbed)",1,0,0.9990715,0.00092845026,False Negative
"Turned 50 and got my first shingles vaccine yesterday evening: Shingles isn't always bad. A couple years ago, my husband had a small rash about the size of a quarter. It didn't hurt, didn't itch, nothing. But it annoyed him that it was there for a couple weeks. He got a telehealth appointment, and the doctor looked at it over Zoom, then had him go right in so the doctor would verify what he thought it was since he wasn't expecting to see shingles in a young person. Well, it was shingles. My husband never had a single pox mark as a kid. He was asymptomatic to the point that he thought he never had chicken pox. There was nothing the doctor could do since there was no pan or anything, but did tell him to stay away from people who hadn't had chickenpox or the vaccine. Oops. Our daughter has a legit medical exemption to most vaccines due to the severity of her reactions to the few she's had (I also react so horribly that I have no intention of ever getting another vaccine-hospitalized twice from vaccine reactions). Poor dear spend her 12th birthday with chickenpox, which sucked. She had measles a few years prior. Though I got Covid thrice (including being one of the 2019 cases), she never got that, but did get the vaccine which made her so, so incredibly sick that fuck anyone who tells me she should get boosters because what about granny.",1,0,0.9925955,0.007404581,False Negative
"Shingles Vaccine: I got the Shingrix series as soon as I cleared up from my 3rd bout of shingles. Get it. I've had shingles 3X, you DON'T want them. First two times were so so (thought I had ant/mosquito bites around my ankles, then the spots went up to my knees and behind my thighs - a coworker said, ""those aren't bites, you've got shingles!"". She was right.) and ouch (inside forearm and spot on ribs, felt like a blowtorch when it woke me up at 1 am, but Capsaicin HP fixed it), 3rd time - I burned my last week of vacation that year ('21) taking 2400-3600 mg. of gabapentin (my PCP recommended that dosage, he was right) and hanging over the arm of my recliner listening to podcasts between naps, lol. I'm still taking gabapentin for PHN next to my spine, right below where the band of my bra runs - 1200- 2400 mg. a day. You don't want that, either. The first shot felt like a horse kicked me from my shoulder to my wrist by bedtime, plus I had fever and chills so bad my teeth were chattering - I've never had that sort of reaction to any shot, ever. However I've only had one tetanus and ten years later, a dTap (after having pertussis at 35 - it was circulating in the town where I worked).

Shingrix question: I'm 46 and have had shingles twice in my life. Once at 32 when 25 weeks pregnant and last year. Both mild rashes but the pain on this most recent one almost took me out. I was able to get the shingles shot prescription since I'm under 50. I'm not usually nervous about vaccines. I've had the first one and it knocked me out for about a day. But fine afterwards. The second one isn't due until October. I'm under a ton of stress lately. My father has cancer and my mom most likely be diagnosed with ALS. My (my only sibling) brother is unfortunately not in the picture. (His choice) and it's just me and my husband and some family friends that are able to help. The diagnosis for both have been devastating. I guess my question is with the increase risk of GBS (Guillan-Barre Syndrome) after shingrix it makes me worried especially since my mom may have a neurological disorder it worries me that I may be more at a risk for something like GBS. I'm sure my anxiety is getting the best of me. Just wanted to see if anyone else has had this experience with the shot. Thank you for your time!,1,0,0.9843077,0.015692266,False Negative
"Any normal covid recoveries out there? Need reassurance: 4x vaxxed and a person with bad health anxiety COVID first timer Tested positive Tuesday, symptoms started Monday afternoon. I opted not to take Paxlovid because I usually struggle with side effects from medications and the last time I took an antiviral for shingles I felt so awful for weeks after. It's like the weirdest cold ever. I have waves of feeling fine and then will get hot flashes or cold flashes, lightheaded, bad headache, minor nasal congestion and a super annoying dry cough that is worse at night. Sneezing..and bloating like none other. But overall I have been sicker in the past. I generally do not get sick, I had a cold earlier this year but prior to that I hadn't been sick since 2019. My friends just had covid weeks ago and they were ok after a few days minus a lingering cough that one of them still has. They are my inspiration I'm looking to lol. I'm drinking lots of water and taking zinc/elderberry lozenges. We are camping next Friday for a week with multiple stops along the way. I have sooo been looking forward to this vacation/trip, my last one I had kidney stones on (??) and spent the whole week recovering. But now reading this Reddit, I am feel anxious about all the could be's. Reading that resting is key for weeks after infection....i mean i can rest for a week but not for *weeks*. Reading about potential rebound...and in the meantime the dishes are piling up and the house is a mess. Reading that your immune system will be down for weeks after and you get every sickness on earth... COVID is not good for someone with anxiety I just need some success stories!

"Another person, first kesimpta dose: Just literally took my first loading dose of kesimpta. I've been beyond nervous and with the help of a 0.5mg of Ativan was able to do the dose. I'm still terrified of what is to come from the first dose side effects, especially how my anxiety likely to magnify anything that does occur. Will update here after 24 hours at least, good or bad. Wish me luck, send me good vibes please. Update 12 hours after - all good, no symptom. My anxiety caused more issues than anything. 18 hours - maybe a very mild headache and some mild diahrea but nothing bad, still did yard work and everything is more or less completely good. 24 hours - about 2 hours before, started feeling body ache and chills from a slight fever. Took a Tylenol and it's chilling out. Caught me off gaurd being so much later than expected but still not bad, the Shingrix vaccine that I had to take as a prerequisite for starting is still so far 5x worse and that was just a day of a vaccine hangover of sorts. 36 hours - the above body ache and small fever last maybe 2hr tops and now just a headache but feel this headache is a tension type one and not Med related. So yay, first loading dose is done. Would suggest if anyone has anxiety around starting it, besides saying that you don't need too at all, would say if the anxiety is bad enough to talk to your doc/neuro as they might have something they can give to take before to ease the anxiety.",0,1,0.0002654284,0.9997346,False Positive
